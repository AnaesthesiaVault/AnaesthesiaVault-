# Anaesthesia for Interventional Pulmonology: EBUS, Cryobiopsy, and More

Prof. Ross Hofmeyr  
Department of Anaesthesia & Perioperative Medicine, University of Cape Town
## **Introduction**

Bronchoscopy is a crucial tool for thoracic surgeons, pulmonologists, intensivists, and anaesthesiologists, utilized for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. It can be divided into **rigid bronchoscopy** and **flexible bronchoscopy**, each with distinct procedural indications and anaesthetic considerations.

- **Rigid Bronchoscopy**: Primarily used for **airway management** in cases of **external compression**, **internal obstruction**, or **lesion removal** (e.g., tracheal stenosis, foreign bodies). This often requires **deep general anaesthesia** (GA) and advanced ventilatory techniques such as **manual ventilation** or **high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV)**.
    
- **Flexible Bronchoscopy**: Has broader indications and allows greater flexibility in **procedure location**, **airway management**, and **ventilatory techniques**. It is commonly used for **diagnostic purposes** under **analgosedation** with **topical anaesthesia**, but with the increasing scope of **Interventional Pulmonology (IP)**, more procedures are performed under **deep sedation** or **GA**.

## **Setting and Patients**

**Interventional Pulmonology Procedures** are commonly performed outside the traditional operating theatre, typically in **bronchoscopy suites**. This necessitates planning and precautions for **remote site anaesthesia**:

- **Anaesthetic Workstation**: As equipment may be brought in specifically for the procedure, it is critical to **check all equipment** and ensure that necessary supplies (e.g., emergency drugs, backup drugs) are readily available. A **compact anaesthetic workstation** should be arranged with easy access to monitoring, suction, infusion pumps, and airway adjuncts.
    
- **Team and Environment**: It is essential to:
    
    - Confirm emergency contact pathways (e.g., staff availability, cellular reception).
    - Clarify procedural roles and responsibilities, especially in situations where the **nursing staff** may not have anaesthesia-specific training.

**Bronchoscopy Suite**:

- These rooms are typically **smaller** than operating theatres and often not ergonomically designed for the **complexity and equipment needs** of modern IP procedures. The setup may require **bronchoscopic stacks**, **ultrasound**, **cytology**, and **fluoroscopy** equipment, and may involve multiple team members.
- **Preoperative Planning**: An early arrival is beneficial to anticipate space and equipment needs and ensure everything is in place.

### **Patient Considerations**

Patients undergoing IP procedures may present with a variety of underlying pulmonary conditions, including **lung cancer**, **tuberculosis**, **sarcoidosis**, **lymphoma**, and **chronic lung diseases** (e.g., COPD, reactive, and interstitial lung diseases). Specific considerations include:

- **Infectious Risk**: Given the high prevalence of **infectious diseases** such as tuberculosis in settings like South Africa, respiratory protection (e.g., N95 masks) is essential.
    
- **Pulmonary Function**: Many patients will have **compromised pulmonary function**, necessitating careful planning of anaesthetic strategy:
    
    - **Avoid intubation** and **neuromuscular blockade** when possible.
    - Use **short-acting agents** to facilitate quick recovery and avoid prolonged respiratory depression.
- **Radiological Review**: Always review radiological investigations to check for **mass lesions** or other relevant findings.
    
- **Bronchospasm and Paraneoplastic Syndromes**: Be aware of the potential for **bronchospasm** or rare **paraneoplastic syndromes**. Ensure that appropriate **emergency drugs** (e.g., bronchodilators, corticosteroids) are readily available in case of airway reactivity or other complications.

### **Anaesthesia for Common Interventional Pulmonology Procedures**

1. **Endobronchial Ultrasound-Guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)**:
    
    - EBUS-TBNA is a minimally invasive procedure used to obtain tissue samples from **mediastinal lymph nodes** or **lung masses**. It often requires **deep sedation** or **GA** to ensure patient immobility and airway protection.
    - **Anaesthetic considerations**: Ensure that oxygenation and ventilation are maintained during the procedure as the bronchoscope occupies the airway. **Supplemental oxygen** or **jet ventilation** may be necessary to manage ventilation.
2. **Bronchial Thermoplasty**:
    
    - This is a therapeutic procedure used to treat **severe asthma** by applying controlled heat to reduce smooth muscle mass in the airways.
    - **Anaesthetic considerations**: Due to the risk of bronchospasm during the procedure, patients often require **GA** with careful airway management. **Short-acting muscle relaxants** and **close monitoring of airway pressures** are recommended.
3. **Cryobiopsy**:
    
    - Used for obtaining lung tissue samples, cryobiopsy is particularly useful in diagnosing **interstitial lung diseases**. The procedure involves freezing lung tissue, which is then removed for analysis.
    - **Anaesthetic considerations**: The risk of **bleeding** and **pneumothorax** is higher compared to conventional biopsy techniques. Patients may need **deep sedation** or **GA** with good access to the airway to manage complications. Immediate access to suction and haemostatic agents is recommended.
### Common Interventional Pulmonology Procedures

#### **1. Bronchoscopy**

- **Overview**: Bronchoscopy involves passing a **flexible endoscope** down the bronchial tree for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
    
- **Diagnostic Uses**: Includes **bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)**, **brushing**, **needle aspiration**, **forceps biopsy**, or **cryobiopsy** to collect **microbiological**, **cytological**, or **histological samples**.
    
- **Therapeutic Uses**: Includes **laser resection**, **coagulation**, **electrosurgery**, **cryotherapy**, **thermoplasty**, **balloon dilatation**, **airway stenting**, and **lung volume reduction**.
    
    **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
    
    - Can be performed with only **topical anaesthesia**, but moderate sedation to **general anaesthesia (GA)** is often required.
    - For GA, **total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA)** with **target-controlled infusion (TCI)** and a **supraglottic airway (SGA)** is ideal.

#### **2. Foreign Body Removal**

- **Overview**: Removal of foreign bodies (e.g., peanuts, bones) via flexible bronchoscopy with **grasping forceps** or **wire baskets**.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
    - Often requires **deep sedation** or **GA** due to the stimulating nature of the procedure.
    - If flexible bronchoscopy is unsuccessful, **rigid bronchoscopy** under GA may be required, often performed in the operating theatre.

#### **3. Endobronchial Ultrasound-Guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)**

- **Overview**: EBUS involves using a **bronchoscope with an ultrasound probe** at the distal end for navigating and biopsying **lesions** or **lymph nodes**. A **biopsy needle** is passed through the working channel to perform **multiple aspirations** under **real-time ultrasound guidance**.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
    - Performed under **GA** to ensure patient immobility, with **SGA** preferred to provide access to the entire trachea and bronchial tree.
    - Procedure duration ranges from **20-60 minutes**.

#### **4. Thermoablation and Bronchial Thermoplasty**

- **Thermoablation**: Used to treat **advanced emphysema** by delivering **steam** via a catheter to specific lung segments, causing **local inflammation** and **atelectasis**.
    
- **Bronchial Thermoplasty**: A procedure for **intractable asthma** that uses **heating wires** to deliver thermal energy to **bronchiolar smooth muscle**, decreasing its mass and contractility to reduce asthma symptoms.
    
    **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
    
    - Both procedures require meticulous **anatomical orientation** and **control of coughing**, making **GA** preferable.

#### **5. Cryobiopsy**

- **Overview**: Involves freezing tissue with a **cryoprobe** and retracting it sharply to obtain lung tissue samples, typically for diagnosing **interstitial lung diseases**.
    
    **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
    
    - Cryobiopsy has a higher risk of **bleeding** and **pneumothorax** compared to conventional biopsy techniques.
    - Performed under **deep sedation** or **GA** with immediate access to **suction** and haemostatic measures.

#### **6. Cryoadhesion and Cryoablation**

- **Cryoadhesion**: Freezing a **foreign body** (e.g., food particles or blood clots) using a cryoprobe to allow easy removal.
    
- **Cryoablation**: Destroys **obstructive or malignant lesions** by applying cycles of **freezing and thawing**.
    
    **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
    
    - **GA** is preferred for procedures involving large airways or peripheral lung parenchymal tissue due to the need for precise control.

#### **7. Medical Thoracoscopy (Pleuroscopy)**

- **Overview**: Similar to **video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)**, but performed with a **single-port approach** using a **rigid endoscope** to inspect or biopsy the pleura, drain effusions, or perform pleurodesis.
    
    **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
    
    - Typically done under **sedation** and **local anaesthesia** with **spontaneous breathing**, without the need for GA or lung isolation.

#### **8. Lung Volume Reduction Procedures**

- **Overview**: These procedures aim to reduce the volume of hyperinflated lungs, particularly in patients with **emphysema**:
    
    - **One-way valves**: Allow air to escape from bullous lung areas without re-inflation, leading to collapse of hyperinflated segments.
    - **Nitinol wire coils**: Deployed in a straight form via the bronchoscope and then “coil” back, compressing the lung tissue.
    
    **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
    - **GA** is recommended to ensure accurate **fluoroscopic positioning** and to control ventilation.
### Anaesthesia for Interventional Pulmonology Procedures

#### **General Considerations**

- **Simple diagnostic bronchoscopy**: Often performed under **sedation** with **topical anaesthesia**.
    - **Supplemental oxygen**: Administered via nasal cannulae, with a **warmed and humidified system** being ideal where available.
    - **Anaesthesia preference**: Many patients and pulmonologists prefer **general anaesthesia (GA)** when an anaesthetist is involved, particularly for complex procedures like **EBUS** or **cryobiopsy**.

#### **Airway Management**

- **Optimal strategy**: Use of a well-fitting, second-generation **supraglottic airway (SGA)** is recommended.
    - **Benefits**: Maintains airway patency, protects against bronchoscope bites, facilitates oxygenation/ventilation, and provides access to the entire trachea and bronchial tree.
    - **Sizing**: Choose SGA based on **ideal body weight** or **height**, as per device specifications.
- **Endotracheal tube (ETT)**: May be preferred for specific cases, such as those requiring **larger bronchoscopes**. Use an ETT of adequate diameter to allow passage of scopes and avoid excessive resistance to gas flow. For instance:
    - A **7.0 mm ETT** accommodates a **6.0 mm bronchoscope**, but not a **6.5 mm EBUS scope**.
    - In cases with high airway resistance, **permissive hypercapnia** and tolerating elevated end-tidal CO₂ is common. The appearance of dysrhythmias should prompt a procedural pause to restore ventilation.

#### **Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA)**

- **Preferred for interventional pulmonology procedures**, especially when there is a need to avoid volatile agents (due to frequent suctioning and circuit opening).
    - **TIVA with TCI (Target-Controlled Infusion)**: Using **propofol** and **remifentanil** is optimal, as this combination provides potent analgesia, suppression of airway reflexes, and avoids the need for neuromuscular blockade.
    - **Ventilation**: **Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV)** through an SGA is recommended. PCV prevents excessive airway pressures while adjusting dynamically to changes in airway resistance during the procedure.
    - **Supplemental topical anaesthesia** (2% lidocaine) applied to the vocal cords and trachea reduces coughing and limits haemodynamic responses without requiring deeper anaesthesia.

#### **Equipment Considerations**

- **Airway adjuncts**:
    - Ensure availability of **ETTs (8.0 mm, 8.5 mm, 9.0 mm)** for larger bronchoscopes or multi-port airway devices.
    - Use **catheter mounts with bronchoscopy ports** to allow bronchoscope passage while maintaining ventilation.
    - **Multiport airway adaptors** are invaluable for procedures requiring passage of multiple devices, such as bronchoscopes and bronchial blockers.

### **Specific Considerations for Cryobiopsy**

- **Cryobiopsy**: Used for peripheral lung tissue sampling, often under **fluoroscopy guidance**.
    
    - **Technique**: A **cryoprobe** (1-2 mm diameter) is advanced into the peripheral lung, and after freezing, the tissue is dislodged and removed. This method improves diagnostic yield but carries significant risk of **bleeding** and **pneumothorax**.
- **Bleeding Prevention**:
    
    - Prior to biopsy, place a **bronchial blocker** in the relevant lobar or segmental bronchus to tamponade any bleeding.
    - The **Univent tube** (with integrated bronchial blocker) or the **Arndt Bronchial Blocker (5 French)** can be used for this purpose.
    - After the biopsy, inflating the bronchial blocker balloon allows for tamponade, while the sample is retrieved for histology. Re-inflation of the balloon can help control any persistent bleeding.
- **Pneumothorax**: Occurs in approximately **15% of cases**. Any rise in ventilator pressures or difficulty maintaining oxygenation should prompt immediate assessment.
    
    - **Lung ultrasound** is highly sensitive for diagnosing pneumothorax and should be performed routinely at the end of every cryobiopsy procedure.
    - **Chest radiography**: Also commonly performed post-procedure to screen for pneumothorax before discharge.
- **Other potential complications**:
    
    - Include **pneumomediastinum**, **trauma to great vessels** or **oesophagus**, and rarely **pneumopericardium**.

### **Summary and Conclusion**

Modern interventional pulmonology procedures require an anaesthetist who is not only skilled in **advanced airway management** but also adaptable to the unique challenges of a **shared airway** environment. Procedures range from simple bronchoscopy to complex interventions like **cryobiopsy** and **bronchial thermoplasty**, requiring flexibility in anaesthetic approaches and an understanding of specific procedural risks, such as **bleeding** and **pneumothorax**. While these procedures pose challenges, they offer significant benefits in terms of reducing the need for invasive surgery and improving diagnostic outcomes.

Anaesthetists play a key role in ensuring patient safety and procedure success through careful pre-procedural planning, optimal airway management, and vigilance in preventing and managing complications.
