## Highlights

> Collectively, the few clinical studies to date suggest that exposure of infants and neonates to surgery and general anesthetics may cause significant neurocogni- tive impairment and a variety of behavioral sequelae. However, all of the studies were done retrospectively and thus could not control for the many variables that come into play during the perioperative period.

> Procedures in premature infants have also been associated with an excess of behavioral disabilities later in life. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/neurotoxicity-191f212609b#c0ba5a0c-55cc-47ce-8fba-0d2b237fbad5)  ^c0ba5a0c

> Unlike the findings in chil- dren whereby some correlation between an early exposure to general anesthesia and lasting neurocognitive impairments have been suggested, clinical studies of postop- erative cognitive decline (POCD) in elderly human population have been less conclu- sive. In fact, except for the initial International Study of Postoperative Cognitive Decline that has suggested that anesthetic duration could be a significant risk factor, no evidence of long-lasting cognitive influences regardless of the anesthetic agent or the anesthetic approach has been put forward. Having said that, the possibility that the patient population with ongoing but clinically undiagnosed neuropathology may prove to be the one most vulnerable to anesthesia-induced POCD should be seriously considered.

> Nevertheless, the investigators reported an increased incidence of cognitive impair- ment, described as regressive behavioral changes, lasting up to 18 months after the procedure. Children younger than 3 years were the most sensitive. These inves- tigators voiced concern that general anesthetics may cause long-term cognitive effects [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/neurotoxicity-191f212609b#33602213-da4f-4669-a7b0-8c49adfd5c6e)  ^33602213

> Collectively, this emerging clinical evidence suggests that children exposed to gen- eral anesthesia before the age of 3 years are particularly vulnerable to developing a variety of behavioral impairments. Furthermore, there appears to be a direct correla- tion between the duration of exposure to general anesthesia and the risk for devel- oping cognitive impairments (ie, longer the exposure, more likely it is that the child will exhibit some form of learning disability later in life) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/neurotoxicity-191f212609b#830f162c-9d4d-454e-8917-5c934104f808)  ^830f162c

> In a population-based retrospective birth-cohort study of 5357 children, Wilder and colleagues 37 found that children who received 2 or more general anesthetics before the age of 4 years were at increased risk of learning disability as adolescents ( Fig. 4 ). Moreover, the risk increased with longer cumulative exposure duration (more than 2 hours). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/neurotoxicity-191f212609b#b3b5989f-ebf5-44dc-a7a1-97d8d64b8519)  ^b3b5989f

> This rapidly emerging human evidence has to be assessed in view of the complexity and interplay between different facets of child development. Not only could the age of exposure be an important determinant of the susceptibility to anesthesia-induced developmental impairments but also the subtlety of the neurocognitive assessment could be a key factor in the ability to capture potential deficits at any given age [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/neurotoxicity-191f212609b#014b1e1a-b0da-4d20-b12e-adb027c68ded)  ^014b1e1a
