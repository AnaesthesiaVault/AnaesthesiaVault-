## Highlights

> In obstetrics, clinicians are still cautious because of
> the risk of amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) and, to a
> lesser extent, the re-transfusion of fetal cells potentially
> causing maternal alloimmunization [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#58dbce40-6df9-4e9b-86ff-59ea7f8924e0)  ^58dbce40

> Severe maternal hemorrhage (mostly happening in the
> postpartum period) is the most leading cause for
> maternal morbidity and mortality.
>  The use of cell salvage in women with high risk for
> maternal hemorrhage (e.g. abnormal placentation) is
> strongly recommended. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#6f42ea0c-7bfb-48df-9abe-3646acab9511)  ^6f42ea0c

> However, recent data reveals,
> that fetal squamous cells are present in the blood of
> healthy pregnant women at the time of placental
> separation at levels comparable to those in salvaged
> blood [14,15]. In addition, AFE is no longer thought to
> be due to embolization of fetal squamous cells but
> instead to be an anaphylactoid syndrome caused by
> fetal antigens [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#7546d981-b9b7-40c4-920e-9ce9190bbbdb)  ^7546d981

> So far, there have been numerous
> trials with the use of intraoperative cell salvage in
> women during caesarean section, and not a single case
> of iatrogenic AFE has been reported  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#531c1850-70de-4472-8b7d-9ed02ed26a50)  ^531c1850

> The
> Association of Anesthetists recommends the use of
> cell salvage in women undergoing caesarean section
> who are anemic before surgery, anticipated to be at
> high risk of hemorrhage or if unanticipated bleeding
> during surgery develops [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#96484391-6566-4c54-991d-749ab4704c33)  ^96484391

> PPH as a cumulative blood loss >1000 ml with signs
> and symptoms of hypovolemia within 24 h after
> birth, regardless of the route of delivery [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#4900a9bd-bf70-4ac1-a0e8-984256dde2ca)  ^4900a9bd

> With
> 27.1%, PPH remains the leading cause of maternal
> death worldwide and affects about 1–10% of all deliv-
> ering women  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#70b61ec1-3170-4d32-a474-77d63a258ff8)  ^70b61ec1

> In the past, recommendations on the use of
> leukocyte depletion filters (LDF) arised to remove
> products such as fetal squamous cells, amniotic fluid
> and bacteria [21]. A study on post wash samples
> found that fetal squamous cells can almost be com-
> pletely be eliminated by using a LDF. In 15 women
> undergoing caesarean section, a significant reduc-
> tion was seen in squamous cell concentration in the
> LDF-postfiltration samples compared to the pre-
> wash samples [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#06206162-8bf7-4ce1-941c-548719f97fec)  ^06206162

> Approximately 10% of all
> women diagnosed with uterine atony require RBC
> transfusion [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#7e2bbe1a-ec38-48d1-a415-3eca83a56db7)  ^7e2bbe1a

> An analysis of data from the German
> Federal Statistical Office of more than 6 million in-
> hospital deliveries in Germany from 2011–2020 dem-
> onstrates, that women with RBC transfusion suffer
> significantly more often from postpartum complica-
> tions like pneumonia (12.45 vs. 0.33%; P< 0.0001),
> postpartum renal failure (0.87 vs. 0.02%; P< 0.0001)
> or cardiac complications (1.18 vs. 0.41; P> 0.0001)
> compared to women without RBC transfusion [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#79bf3406-31a6-4ddd-b657-a0e6dc6dcbce)  ^79bf3406

> Postpartum hemor-
> rhage (PPH) accounts for up to one-third of maternal
> deaths in both developing and developed countries [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#c5fe604a-21c8-43ac-8c14-e17aae382366)  ^c5fe604a

> Cell salvage has proven to be beneficial and should be
> considered for various indications in obstetrics includ-
> ing severe maternal hemorrhage and numerous forms
> of placental disorders [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#55ee6c85-8d86-4d3b-8eaa-1c93de08bc85)  ^55ee6c85

> represent a risk factor for adverse reactions [22,23].
> Furthermore, some studies reported unexplained
> hypotension associated with blood return and LDF
> [24,25]. Moreover, the addition of a filter may restrict
> the rapid reinfusion of blood in the context of mas-
> sive hemorrhage by slowing down the blood flow
> rate. For this reason, LDF are no longer used in many
> institutions that regularly perform cell salvage,
> including the institutions in which the authors work.
> Their aim is to return the patient’s salvaged blood
> without unnecessary delay [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0003-pdf-191954ba8f6#7d1f98bd-570d-4743-84cb-b30da0aec480)  ^7d1f98bd
