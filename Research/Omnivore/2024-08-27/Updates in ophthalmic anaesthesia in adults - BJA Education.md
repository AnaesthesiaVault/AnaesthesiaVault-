## Highlights

> Ophthalmic operations are considered low risk [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#4394d6fe-b4f1-4d97-9c6e-9a872f6e2622)  ^4394d6fe

> term ‘low risk’ relates to complications of both anaesthesia and surgery, and that the risk of GA in ophthalmic surgery is similar to that of a day-case knee arthroscopy. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#b21dfd42-69c0-4370-a4da-e27abe8fbc21)  ^b21dfd42

> ophthalmic procedures should be postponed or cancelled only if delaying surgery allows optimisation of the patient that consequently results in better outcomes, or if the clinical history and examination assess there to be a need for further urgent evaluation, even if the elective surgery had not been planned. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#18de17c5-a7d9-42fd-ac26-c04188f65984)  ^18de17c5

> Chest pain suggestive of unstable angina, tachycardia/bradycardia with haemodynamic instability or heart failure, shortness of breath with pallor, decreased urine output with fatigue, jaundice and malaise are examples. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#cc03e2ac-f637-4388-8256-6bbbd355695c)  ^cc03e2ac

> #### Hypertension
> 
> Hypertension is frequently encountered in the elderly. The threshold blood pressure for delay in elective ophthalmic surgery remains contentious. Severe hypertension (blood pressure ≥180/110 mmHg) should warrant consideration for surgery postponement, particularly if there is evidence of concurrent end-organ damage and concomitant symptoms. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#c881704e-0eb5-437a-a32d-be8b0cd4e6ff)  ^c881704e

> Naturally, elective surgery should not proceed should the patient be suspected of acute hypoglycaemic (blood glucose <4.0 mmol L−1 with symptoms and signs of hypoglycaemia) or hyperglycaemic (blood glucose ≥17 mmol L−1 with symptoms and signs of acute hyperglycaemic emergency) crises. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#4115eb80-27a6-4244-99fd-39312475a60d)  ^4115eb80

> Dementia [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#14aa6d03-976a-4ed5-802a-d50babd4405f)  ^14aa6d03

> The anaesthetist should distinguish between these for the purpose of determining which patients may be able to tolerate locoregional anaesthesia techniques _vs_ those requiring GA. Both present specific risks. Although controversial, GA entails the risk of postoperative cognitive decline and neurocognitive disorder. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#09c1b717-e435-4ccd-8d6c-401313bac9ce)  ^09c1b717

> The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) is a validated an easy-to implement seven-stage dementia assessment tool that may be used in the perioperative period.
> 
>  The anaesthetist may consider regional ophthalmic techniques at a threshold GDS of 5 or less if there is concurrence with the ophthalmologist. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#e2a29568-9e92-45a8-bdf8-fa5e9930ed5d)  ^e2a29568

> General principles for preoperative investigations [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#d3e7d815-70f2-46bf-8e95-9cb2520b748d)  ^d3e7d815

> preoperative tests are not reviewed; they do not change management and seldom alter outcomes, particularly so in lower-risk surgeries. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#0c147c30-d1b0-4976-b2c5-1d3affa10237)  ^0c147c30

> A landmark, multicentre, prospective trial by Schein and colleagues sought to determine the value of routine preoperative medical testing in patients undergoing cataract surgeries.
> 
>  The conclusion was that routine medical testing did not reduce harm and improve patients' safety. Moreover, the authors suggested that preoperative tests be ordered when clinical examination would have indicated the need for an investigation, even if the procedure had not been planned. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#a2ddadef-ce67-4afd-930b-8c23ea0c897b)  ^a2ddadef

> Considering the high strength of evidence from the meta-analyses, international guidelines from the Royal Colleges of Anaesthetists and Ophthalmologists and the American Academy of Ophthalmology amongst others, have recommended that routine medical tests before cataract surgery are unnecessary and do not improve patient safety. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#9a012444-8efb-4637-93ec-c353fb3a78ea)  ^9a012444

> Anaesthetic techniques for ophthalmic surgery [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#0d270d8f-6573-44a0-bace-674d99d12fd1)  ^0d270d8f

> There has been a shift in the delivery of anaesthesia from GA towards locoregional anaesthesia techniques for several reasons: improved efficiency, cost-saving, patient safety and outcomes while maintaining patient satisfaction. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#3717b89d-04fc-4a6e-8bbf-334ccb746fd4)  ^3717b89d

> General anaesthesia remains the preferred technique for complex and prolonged procedures in patients who are unable to cooperate with instructions and lie still in the appropriate position for the procedure (e.g. patients with Parkinson's disease, dementia, intellectual impairment, deafness, tremors or claustrophobia). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#5e405a95-6e87-4177-8684-2d9ffb2b8e3a)  ^5e405a95

> Total intravenous anaesthesia has gained popularity in ophthalmic anaesthesia. It provides smooth induction and emergence and less postoperative nausea and vomiting. However, it is associated with increased incidence of oculocardiac reflex during surgery.
> 
> Supraglottic airway devices have been used widely as the primary airway device. They have many advantages, including fewer sympathetic responses associated with laryngoscopy and intubation, fewer issues at emergence (e.g. coughing, straining and retching), and ultimately less of an increase in IOP. In one study, the LMA Classic (Teleflex Medical, Athlone, Ireland), Ambu AuraFlex (Ambu A/S, Ballerup, UK) and LMA ProSeal (Teleflex Medical) were found to provide the lowest vertical profiles and less encroachment into the surgical field.
> 
> The fear of intraoperative movement resulting in catastrophic complications has led to the preference of ‘profound’ neuromuscular block (post-tetanic counts=1–3) by some practitioners.
> 
>  The availability of sugammadex has contributed to effective reversal of neuromuscular block and operating theatre efficacy. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/updates-in-ophthalmic-anaesthesia-in-adults-bja-education-19194b00374#c253cc35-da51-488b-8f9a-56c07d679321)  ^c253cc35

> #### Cannula-based (sub-Tenon's) block
> 
> Performing a sub-Tenon's block involves dissection of conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule with forceps and blunt-tipped scissors and insertion of a blunt-ended cannula into the sub-Tenon's space.
> 
>  The lower eyelid is retracted open with a speculum, and the patient is often asked to look upwards and outwards to facilitate dissection. The inferonasal quadrant is the most used access point, although other quadrants have also been used. The typical LA volume needed is 2–5 ml.
> 
> #### Recent advances in sub-Tenon's block
> 
> The sub-Tenon's block has undergone several modifications since its reintroduction in the 1990s. Different types of metal and plastic cannulae have been used. An incisionless (without dissection) technique has been described.
