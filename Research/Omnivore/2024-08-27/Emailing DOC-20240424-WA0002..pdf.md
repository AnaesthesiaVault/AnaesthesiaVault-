## Highlights

> Informed consent
> Given the knowledge on failing spinal anesthesia
> for CD summarized in this article, it would seem
> obvious that the process of informed consent
> includes information on expected and unexpected
> sensations during CD under regional anesthesia
> [7&&]. This information should include the frequency
> of failure of the technique and the different options
> to improve the situation, including the possibility of
> conversion to GA. Following the OAA guideline,
> general anesthesia should not only be discussed as
> a rescue technique, but as the primary alternative to
> neuraxial anesthesia [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0002-pdf-191954be26f#f8242d23-35c0-4b4f-941d-d1061a644e1b)  ^f8242d23

> or fentanyl (25–50 mg) since they alleviate intraoper-
> ative pain. Some do also recommend small doses of
> ketamine (10 mg), alpha-2 adrenergic agonists or
> nitrous oxide. Pure hypnotic agents such as midazo-
> lam and propofol should not be used without an
> analgesic. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0002-pdf-191954be26f#b4cf951e-78f1-4620-9343-7cff811c8271)  ^b4cf951e

> A reasonable approach in
> case of partial failure is to use CSE with a reduced
> intrathecal dose or to switch to a pure epidural
> technique. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0002-pdf-191954be26f#99bf9e91-b6e2-459a-951f-e2dd20e3208e)  ^99bf9e91

> Other known issues are pseudo-suc-
> cessful lumbar punctures. They occur when a reflux
> of clear fluid is mistaken for CSF when it is in fact
> due to a previous injection (local anesthetic or epi-
> dural saline). Pseudo-successful lumbar punctures
> can also occur in case of Tarlov cyst [12] or when
> accidental needle movement or needle position
> results in partial injection into the epidural space [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0002-pdf-191954be26f#c0b233e5-1022-4a3f-9216-142b5aee3b01)  ^c0b233e5

> Failure of neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery
> occurs in up to 12%. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0002-pdf-191954be26f#f80a632a-38ae-447c-803b-34e393fbfd3e)  ^f80a632a

> There is no reason to test for the upper sensory
> level of SA until some extent of motor block has
> been established in the lower extremities. The easi-
> est method to test for motor block is the straight leg
> test, where the patient is asked to lift the legs against
> gravity. The narration of Susanna Stanford is a
> frightening example that asking the same question
> over and over again (i.e. testing for cold sensation)
> eventually leads to a (false) positive answer [6].
> Recently, a working group by the Obstetric Anaes-
> thetist’s Association (OAA) in the UK has published
> guidelines on prevention and management of intra-
> operative pain during CD [7&&]. These guidelines also
> cover informed consent and management of intra-
> operative pain and give a detailed recommendation
> on preoperative assessment of neuraxial block [7&&].
> A level of T5 to loss of touch sensation is
> required for CD [7&&]. With a sensory level of T10
> a forceps test is probably already negative. For psy-
> chological reasons, we recommend that anesthesi-
> ologists do not allow surgeons to perform a forceps
> test at the site of incision before the sensory level
> required for surgery, i.e. loss of touch sensation at T5
> or above, has been reached. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0002-pdf-191954be26f#cf8c7d27-92d0-4f0a-9923-6b5892e73169)  ^cf8c7d27

> Prevention
> SA is one of the most reliable regional block methods
> [9]. The best way to handle failed SA is similar to
> management of the difficult airway in obstetrics:
> anticipate the risk and avoid it – but have a good
> plan if you do have to manage it. The first step to
> minimize the risk of failed SA is to recognize the
> importance of a meticulous approach when per-
> forming the block [9]. This includes positioning of
> the patient, identification of subarachnoid space,
> injection of the solution and patient management
> throughout the procedure [9].
> Knowledge of risk factors for SA failures is
> obviously critical in order to handle modifiable risk
> factors. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0002-pdf-191954be26f#6a989a64-7a3e-4c4e-9755-b5b51ae26480)  ^6a989a64

> In preterm
> CD, less women reached a sensory level of T4, and it
> took longer to get there when compared to term CD
> [14]. The hypothesis is that in pregnant women lower
> dose of intrathecal drugs are required because there is
> a decrease in subarachnoid and epidural volumes due
> to uterine enlargement, caval obstruction and epi-
> dural vein distension. However, in preterm pregnan-
> cies and in lower birth weight the volume of
> intrathecal/epidural volume might be less affected,
> and the usual reduced intrathecal doses may prove
> insufficient [3]. The same might be true for patients
> with low body mass index [2&&] [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0002-pdf-191954be26f#b42984f3-d2fe-4dbd-bd53-66ccb05f35dc)  ^b42984f3

> Risk factors for spinal failure
> There are two recent retrospective studies, which
> analyzed factors associated with SA failure and are
> summarized in Table 1. Stav et al. [13&&] included
> 4305 patients and calculated odds ratios for con-
> version to GA, while Jin et al. [2&&] included 5361
> patients and calculated odds ratios for repeat neu-
> raxial technique or conversion to GA.
> Jin et al. [2&&] also ranked risk factors for require-
> ment of alternate anesthetic technique or analgesic
> supplementation when 12 mg hyperbaric bupiva-
> caine with fentanyl and morphine was used. The
> rank of these risk factors were:
> (1) Previous CD (independent of the number of CD)
> (2) Longer surgery duration
> (3) Lower birth weight
> (4) Lower gestational age
> (5) Lower body mass index
> (6) Tubal ligation [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0002-pdf-191954be26f#07f5275f-b461-4287-8fd9-766875c339bd)  ^07f5275f

> Interestingly, the lumbar level of spinal punc-
> ture can also influence the risk of SA failure, as the
> failure rate seems higher with punctures at L4/5 or
> L5/S1 when compared to higher levels [2&&]. The
> local anesthetic solution might be entrapped below
> lumbar lordosis, especially if performed in the sit-
> ting position [9]. On the other hand, a higher lum-
> bar level cannot be recommended without a word of
> caution: clinical determination of lumbar level is
> alarmingly inaccurate [15] and direct needle trauma
> to the conus has been described [16]. It seems cau-
> tious to select a lower lumbar level unless the correct
> lumbar level is verified by ultrasound. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-doc-20240424-wa-0002-pdf-191954be26f#aca0fec2-0c88-4252-8313-2f95d9803296)  ^aca0fec2
