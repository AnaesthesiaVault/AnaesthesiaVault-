## Highlights

> CONTRAINDICATIONS
> The only absolute contraindication to insertion of a lumbar drain for aortic surgery is patient refusal. Relative contraindications
> should be weighed against an individual’s risk of SCI. Abnormal coagulation may increase the risk of neuraxial haematoma and
> intracranial haemorrhage.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#46d539c2-0d27-4b23-be2d-0830603050c5)  ^46d539c2

> INSERTION AND SET-UP
> CSF drainage systems consist of an intrathecal catheter connected to a transducer and reservoir. Insertion of the
> intrathecal catheter should be performed by a consultant anaesthetist or a senior trainee under their supervision.
> Alternatively, they may be inserted by a neuroradiologist under fluoroscopy guidance. While they are usually inserted
> immediately preoperatively, some institutions recommend spinal drain insertion the day before elective surgery to provide a
> longer delay before intraoperative heparinisation. However, this may require the patient to spend an extra night in a high-
> dependency setting [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#7db0545e-5b19-4532-9afb-3db0f793b5b4)  ^7db0545e

> Equipment
> A standard epidural pack is required for insertion of the intrathecal catheter. A 16G Tuohy needle with a 19G catheter or a 14G
> Tuohy needle with a 16G catheter may be used. While there is a lower risk of drain failure with wider-bore catheters, there is a
> greater risk of complications, such as postdural puncture headache, neuraxial haematoma, and intracranial haemorrhage.19
> The catheter may be a standard, fenestrated, clear epidural catheter or a silicone catheter.
> There are various forms of external drainage systems, most of which have the following common components: clear tubing, a
> 3-way tap with branches leading to a flushless transducer, and a drip chamber, which drains into a collection bag. Specific
> drainage kits include the Codmant EDS 3Ce External Drainage System (Johnson & Johnson Medical Ltd. Pinewood Campus,
> Nine Mile Ride, Wokingham, United Kingdom) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#a7176166-6988-4968-b106-1e380219688a)  ^a7176166

> Anticoagulation
> The American Society of Regional Anesthesia recommends a delay of 60 minutes between neuraxial technique and systemic
> heparinisation and most institutions support this.16 Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis can be administered postoperatively
> with the drain in situ; however, there should be sufficient time between heparin administration on either side of catheter
> removal, according to local guidelines. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#a4b3480a-7475-4d81-8d4c-05ba014b5ef1)  ^a4b3480a

> significant, and may be as high as 24% for extensive open TAAA repairs.3 The reported risk following thoracic endovascular
> aortic repair (TEVAR) is generally lower, approximately 4% on average, ranging from 0% to 10.3 [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#93830d28-2edc-4f25-949d-ce6974945252)  ^93830d28

> more recent systematic
> review of studies between 2016 and 2018 presented a rate of persistent SCI of 1% to 2% following TEVAR [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#5641bd76-e671-47d2-9c73-71db1afe92ff)  ^5641bd76

> nonrandomised studies and retrospective studies supporting the use of lumbar drains in TEVAR.11 However, a systematic
> review of 3 randomised controlled trials found limited evidence in favour of CSF drainage.12 Furthermore, Yoshitani et al13
> found an increase in motor deficit at discharge among patients who had spinal drains in a retrospective review of practice in
> Japan.13
> In spite of equivocal evidence, CSF drainage is, nonetheless, recommended by the European Association of Cardiothoracic
> Surgery, the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Cardiology Foundation, and the American Heart
> Association for high-risk thoracoabdominal aortic surgery. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#2e6cb624-77f5-4964-b1dc-1e58d7f8e588)  ^2e6cb624

> Catheter Removal
> CSF drainage should continue for at least 48 hours postoperatively since the risk of developing SCI is highest in the first 2 days.
> In the event of lower limb neurological abnormality, then the drain may remain in situ for up to 5 days. Beyond 5 days, the risk of
> infection increases considerably. Prior to removal, some institutions advocate clamping the drain for a period of time, allowing
> CSF pressure to normalise while assessing lower limb neurology. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#989662bf-a96b-40da-91ac-46eec699a4b8)  ^989662bf

> Aetiology of SCI
> Blood supply to the spinal cord is from (1) longitudinal arteries: the single anterior spinal artery and paired posterior spinal
> arteries, which arise from the vertebral arteries and (2) segmental arteries, which contribute to a complex anastomotic network
> involving the longitudinal vessels (see Figure 1). Segmental arteries include branches of the intercostal, lumbar, inferior
> mesenteric, internal iliac, and sacral arteries. The artery of Adamkiewicz is a major contributor to the anterior spinal artery
> supply to the thoracolumbar spinal cord and arises from a segmental artery at T9-12 vertebral level in most people. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#e06ae858-02c6-47a1-900b-d0a7cdf4413a)  ^e06ae858

> Technique
> The procedure can be performed with the patient seated or in the lateral decubitus position. Insertion may be less technically
> difficult in the seated position; however, it may result in drainage of a greater initial volume of CSF, owing to the higher lumbar
> CSF pressure in this position. The lateral decubitus position may be used for insertion in the anaesthetised or sedated patient.
> Approach should be at the L3/4 or L4/5 vertebral level, below the termination of the spinal cord.
> There should be meticulous attention to asepsis, including ‘scrubbing up’, draping the back and using chlorhexidine spray,
> which should be allowed to dry before needle insertion. The insertion technique is similar to insertion of an epidural, using loss
> of resistance to saline to locate the epidural space. Once in the epidural space, the loss-of-resistance syringe should be
> removed and the Tuohy needle advanced slowly, until the dura is penetrated and CSF flows freely. If a bloody tap occurs, resite
> at a different vertebral level and ensure heparinisation is delayed for at least 60 minutes. If 2 bloody taps occur, consider
> postponing surgery. The catheter is then threaded intrathecally and 6 to 9 cm is left in the space; if there is persistent
> paraesthesia, then the catheter should be withdrawn until this resolves. A filter should not be used as it may obstruct CSF flow.
> The catheter should be secured to the patient’s back with a clear dressing, avoiding the surgical field. Aspiration of CSF should
> be confirmed after securing the catheter and after positioning of the patient on the operating table. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#91e19a5d-1408-41d5-b96d-fdefba154e13)  ^91e19a5d

> INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT
> The goal of CSF drainage is to maintain SCPP above 70 mm Hg. A CSF pressure of less than 10 mm Hg and a MAP between
> 80 and 100 mm Hg should therefore be targeted.3 Continuous CSF drainage risks tearing of the subdural veins and intracranial
> haemorrhage. Instead, when CSF pressure approaches or exceeds 10 mm Hg, CSF should be drained in 5 to 10 mL
> increments until the pressure returns below 10 mm Hg. If CSF pressure continues to rise despite drainage, MAP should be
> increased until SCPP is greater than 70 mm Hg. Under normal circumstances, the rate of drainage should not exceed 15 mL/h.
> It is useful to bear in mind the normal physiological turnover of CSF, which is approximately 10 to 20 mL/h, to prevent excessive
> drainag [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#e2bd9cdf-a033-4392-97df-6b417e0bdd94)  ^e2bd9cdf

> COMPLICATIONS
> The overall rate of complications associated with lumbar CSF drainage is 6.5%.20 The presence of the following factors is
> associated with a higher risk of complications: the use of a wider-bore catheter and Tuohy needle, difficult insertion, and blood-
> tinged CSF [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#37b55c73-279f-4c0d-8d10-6295a11b54dc)  ^37b55c73

> Spinal cord perfusion pressure is analogous to cerebral perfusion pressure. It is the difference between the mean arterial
> pressure (MAP) and the greater of central venous pressure and spinal CSF pressure. Therefore, maintaining sufficient MAP,
> while limiting central venous pressure and spinal CSF pressure enables preservation of spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP),
> and reduces the risk of ischaemic insult to the spinal cord.
> The aetiology of SCI following aortic surgery is multifactorial. During open TAAA repair, clamping of the aorta disrupts collateral
> blood supply to the spinal cord and increases blood pressure in the head and neck, resulting in increased CSF production and
> intracranial pressure and increased central venous pressure, and may lead to systemic administration of hypotensive agents.
> These factors result in a reduction in SCPP. Furthermore, SCPP may be compromised postoperatively due to spinal cord
> oedema caused by intraoperative ischaemia and reperfusion injury [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#f0ee746c-a9f0-4c84-9ea6-9a459a0da92d)  ^f0ee746c

> Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage has been shown to reduce the risk of ischaemic SCI following aortic surgery.
> However, spinal drains are associated with significant complications in their own right [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#8ab75b65-72f9-4555-b465-8d96b1493780)  ^8ab75b65

> RISK FACTORS FOR SCI
> The incidence of SCI varies depending on a number of surgical, patient, and anaesthetic factors (see Table 1). Length and
> extent of surgery, previous surgery, chronic kidney disease (an indicator of the extent of atherosclerosis), and hypotension are
> factors that are commonly reported in the literature. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#44add01c-d316-4cf3-bc67-806dd0181ad8)  ^44add01c

> POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT
> Patients with lumbar CSF drains should be managed postoperatively in a high-dependency or intensive care setting where
> clinicians are trained to manage CSF drains. The following variables should be monitored in the postoperative period: CSF
> pressure, MAP, Glasgow coma scale, pupil diameter and reactivity, lower limb power and sensation, and CSF colour and
> volume drained. The catheter site should be inspected regularly for signs of infection and CSF leakage. If the patient is
> invasively ventilated, sedation should be held regularly to allow neurological assessment.
> If CSF pressure exceeds an agreed threshold, for example 10 mm Hg, then incremental drainage should be performed as
> above. Drainage should occur with the patient semirecumbent at 308 or less. If CSF pressure is persistently raised, a higher
> MAP should be targeted.
> If a patient develops a lower limb neurological deficit, CSF should be drained freely with the patient lying flat until CSF pressure
> is less than 5 mm Hg. MAP should be increased above 90 mm Hg and haemoglobin maintained above 100 g/dL. Spinal cord
> imaging should be considered if symptoms persist as paraplegia may occur secondary to neuraxial haematoma, a complication
> of spinal drain insertion. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#368dc183-b6a0-48a6-ae13-34788c45b58a)  ^368dc183

> Setting Up the CSF Drainage System
> The system should contain a flushless transducer and 3-way taps should be clearly labelled to prevent inadvertent intrathecal
> administration of fluid or drugs. Strict aseptic technique should be used, avoiding chlorhexidine [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#4a39c1e5-b3d5-4fd5-891f-c1004a1f256f)  ^4a39c1e5

> INDICATIONS
> The decision to insert a spinal drain preoperatively depends on a balance of risks and benefits, which should be considered by
> the operating consultant surgeon and consultant anaesthetist. Preemptive insertion of a lumbar drain and maintenance of CSF
> pressure below 10 mm Hg is recommended by the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery and the European
> Society of Cardiology for all open TAAA repair and high-risk TEVAR (see risk factors in italics in Table 1).3,14 The American
> College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines recommend CSF drainage for high-risk open and
> endovascular thoracic aortic repair.15 Prolonged postoperative ventilation is an indication for CSF drainage since detection of
> neurological deficit is hindered in these cases. Spinal drains may also be placed postoperatively as an emergency treatment for
> patients showing signs of SCI. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#6453dfb0-95e1-4e5f-8d43-d908ae2c1ed8)  ^6453dfb0

> Presentation of SCI may be immediate or delayed up to 48 hours after surgery. Delayed-onset symptoms are more common
> following TEVAR than open repair and tend to be associated with episodes of hypotension [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#e44c1649-3ff3-4cbe-8137-6857ba6b9853)  ^e44c1649

> The incidence of SCI—defined as a persistent paraparesis or paraplegia—
> following this surgery varies with the presence of certain risk factors. While the risk of SCI has declined over time, it remains [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#027ba088-6623-41dc-a9c1-222573f25f0e)  ^027ba088

> Evidence for CSF Drainage
> CSF drainage was first proposed for the prevention of SCI by McCullough et al8 in 1988 and has since become a popular
> technique employed in TAAA repair. By monitoring CSF pressure and maintaining it below 10 mm Hg, spinal drains preserve
> SCPP. The evidence for CSF drainage provides differing results. The positive impact of CSF drainage in open TAAA surgery
> in preventing SCI is supported by 2 randomised controlled trials9,10 and there are also a number of prospective [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#fe2eb370-d1ee-41f2-bcc6-b4ed5fb1c02b)  ^fe2eb370

> The transducer should be positioned at a consistent height—for example, at the level of drain insertion, the right atrium, or the
> tragus—and the pressure wave should be labelled as ICP (intracranial pressure) on the monitor. The drip chamber is positioned
> around 15 cm below the transducer. The 3-way tap controls whether the CSF pressure is monitored (tap off to drain) or CSF is
> drained (tap off to transducer) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/emailing-atow-465-00-pdf-192758131d1#7333f5a6-06b9-4002-a9e5-dc23709f1685)  ^7333f5a6
