{"hypothetical_1":"Medical Notes > Obstetrics > Pregnancy Complications > Eclampsia: Eclampsia is a severe complication of pregnancy characterized by the onset of seizures, typically in a woman who has preeclampsia. It is a medical emergency and can be life-threatening for both the mother and the baby. Symptoms may include severe headaches, vision disturbances, upper abdominal pain, and altered mental status. Immediate medical intervention is required to manage the condition.","hypothetical_2":"Medical Notes > Obstetrics > Pregnancy Complications > Eclampsia > Symptoms and Diagnosis: Eclampsia is diagnosed when a pregnant woman with preeclampsia develops seizures. Symptoms to watch for include severe headaches, visual disturbances, nausea or vomiting, and pain in the upper right abdomen. Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation and may include blood tests, urine tests, and imaging studies to assess the severity and impact on the mother and fetus.","hypothetical_3":"Medical Notes > Obstetrics > Pregnancy Complications > Eclampsia > Treatment: The primary treatment for eclampsia involves controlling the seizures and managing blood pressure. Magnesium sulfate is commonly used to prevent further seizures. Antihypertensive medications may be administered to control high blood pressure. Delivery of the baby is often necessary to resolve the condition, and the timing of delivery depends on the severity of the condition and the gestational age of the fetus."}

Based on your notes, eclampsia is a severe complication of pre-eclampsia characterized by the onset of seizures in a woman with pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia itself is defined as new-onset hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg) occurring after 20 weeks of gestation, accompanied by proteinuria or other signs of organ dysfunction such as renal impairment, liver dysfunction, neurological complications, or hematological abnormalities. Eclampsia represents a progression of pre-eclampsia and is associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The management of eclampsia involves controlling blood pressure, preventing seizures with medications like magnesium sulfate, and timely delivery of the baby to mitigate risks to both the mother and the fetus.
