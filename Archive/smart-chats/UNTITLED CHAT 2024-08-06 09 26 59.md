Based on my notes how would this patients pressure volume loop change
The patient's condition, characterized by increased afterload, diastolic and systolic failure secondary to catecholamine release, large fluid shifts, acute kidney injury, and endothelial dysfunction, may have triggered a significant sympathetic response. Additionally, the combination of extubation with subsequent sympathetic stimulation, the absence of volatile agents, and termination of positive end-expiratory pressure in support of the left ventricle may have contributed to the observed response in SCAPE. The sudden increase in preload and afterload, in the presence of diastolic and systolic dysfunction, could have overwhelmed the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in acute pulmonary oedema

 Based on the information provided, the patient's pressure-volume loop may demonstrate increased afterload due to the sympathetic response and fluid shifts. This increased afterload could lead to decreased stroke volume and increased end-systolic volume, as the heart struggles to eject blood against the higher resistance. Additionally, the patient's diastolic and systolic dysfunction may result in reduced compliance, further exacerbating the decrease in stroke volume. The acute pulmonary oedema caused by the increased afterload and fluid shifts may also affect the pressure-volume loop, as the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature could lead to a shift in the end-diastolic pressure and volume. The overall effect would be a steeper pressure-volume loop with a reduced stroke volume and increased end-systolic volume.
