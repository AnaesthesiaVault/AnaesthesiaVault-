Based on my notes how would I provide anaesthesia for mitral regurgitation

{"hypothetical_1":"Medical Notes > Anesthesia > Cardiovascular Anesthesia > Mitral Valve Disease > Mitral Regurgitation: For patients with mitral regurgitation, the primary goals of anesthesia management include maintaining forward flow and avoiding increases in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Preoperative evaluation should focus on the severity of regurgitation, left ventricular function, and any associated conditions such as atrial fibrillation. Intraoperative monitoring should include arterial line placement for continuous blood pressure monitoring and possibly a pulmonary artery catheter to assess cardiac output and filling pressures. Induction agents should be chosen to avoid significant decreases in heart rate or contractility. Maintenance of anesthesia can be achieved with volatile agents, but care should be taken to avoid excessive myocardial depression. Vasodilators may be used to reduce afterload and improve forward flow. Postoperative care should include careful monitoring for signs of heart failure or low cardiac output syndrome.","hypothetical_2":"Medical Notes > Anesthesia > Cardiovascular Anesthesia > Mitral Valve Disease > Anesthetic Considerations: In patients with mitral regurgitation, it is crucial to maintain a balance between heart rate and rhythm to optimize cardiac output. Tachycardia should be avoided as it can worsen regurgitation, but a mild increase in heart rate can be beneficial by reducing the regurgitant volume. Anesthetic drugs that cause bradycardia or significant myocardial depression should be used cautiously. Regional anesthesia techniques may be considered, but the potential for hemodynamic instability must be carefully managed. Intraoperative echocardiography can be a valuable tool for assessing the adequacy of valve function and ventricular performance during surgery.","hypothetical_3":"Medical Notes > Anesthesia > Cardiovascular Anesthesia > Mitral Valve Disease > Intraoperative Management: During the intraoperative period, the anesthetic management of mitral regurgitation involves careful hemodynamic monitoring and the use of agents that support myocardial function. Avoiding increases in SVR is critical, as this can exacerbate regurgitation. Agents such as nitroglycerin or sodium nitroprusside may be used to decrease afterload. Inotropic support may be necessary if ventricular function is compromised. Fluid management should be optimized to maintain adequate preload without causing volume overload. The use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can provide real-time assessment of ventricular function and guide fluid and pharmacologic management."}
