### 👋 **Welcome To AnaesthesiaVault**

My name is Dr. Francois Uys, a registrar in Anaesthesia from South Africa. **AnaesthesiaVault** is my second brain—an evolving compendium of interconnected anaesthesia and critical care knowledge. It’s designed to answer the common question, _"What should I study for finals?"_ while also serving as a valuable resource for clinical practice.

📚 The content is aimed at registrar and consultant anaesthetists, offering in-depth knowledge for advanced training. It’s meticulously referenced, though not peer-reviewed, and every effort has been made to ensure accuracy. Please refer to the [Disclaimer](https://anaesthesiavault.xyz/Disclaimer) for limitations and the [About](https://anaesthesiavault.xyz/About) section for more details.

💬 **Join our community** on Discord to share feedback, suggest new topics, or report any issues: [AnaesthesiaVault Discord](https://discord.gg/cGkzMPyd).
