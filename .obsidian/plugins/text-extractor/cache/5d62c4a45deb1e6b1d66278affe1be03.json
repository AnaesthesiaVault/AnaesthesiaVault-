Diagnosis applied ultrasound and decision making during perioperative period resulted in change in the management of 31% with 95% ci of 21.06 to 42.04 and odds ratio of 2.68 (1.77 to 4.06) related to hemodynamic, airway and respiratory perioperative management. conclUsions: since most of the articles included in this review are observational studies with inherent design con- cerns, there is an urgent requirement for randomized controlled trials in this area. as anesthesiologists become more comfortable and knowledgeable in ultrasound applied to the perioperative support, emergence of protocols with multidis- ciplinary ultrasound exploration is expected to allow an improvement in perioperative safety.

We also excluded studies not per- formed in routine clinical practice (cadaver studies, industry sponsored, and clinical trials with treatment). among the references, we proceeded to iden- tify potentially relevant publications through ti- tle analysis, using the Zotero software as a bib- liographic tool. After identification, screening of abstracts was carried out, with initial evalua- tion of screened sample, analysis of qualitative variables and distribution of ultrasound per- formed by anesthesiologists in patients sched- uled for surgery per exploration and diagnostic orientation. the extracted data were recorded in excel format and the eligibility process was started with complete reading, excluding stud- ies in which data could not be extracted. From the selected studies, a new critical reading was performed, using the starD checklist for the qualitative analysis.8 Statistical analysis For the quantitative analysis, the Medcal v. 17.1 program was used. Dichotomous quan- titative variable was analyzed in proportion of changes during anesthetic management after ultrasound. as a measure of effect, ultrasound odds ratio was calculated for diagnosis and decision making. the impact of perioperative ultrasound was assessed by calculating risk difference and 95% confidence intervals (95% ci) were calculated for all estimators. graphi- cal methodological heterogeneity was evalu- ated, in addition to cochrane I2 and Q statistics and publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot analysis. Evidence synthesis the selecting process is summarized in flow chart Figure 1. Of the 1112 references areas as regional anesthesia, hemodynamic and airway management,6, 7 the practice of ultra- sound as a diagnostic and complementary tool is still lacking in evidence. the wide use and acceptance of ultrasound observed in anesthesi- ologist performance, is not followed by frequent publications on its use, particularly when applied to diagnosis and decision making during the perioperative period. the aim of this study was to identify published papers related to the use of ultrasound by anesthesiologists in fields other than regional anesthesia, vascular access or car- diac surgery. through the information provided in these studies, we aim to assess the ultrasound scans per diagnosis areas, orientation and change of management in the perioperative period. Evidence acquisition Based on the PrisMa statement for reviews of clinical trials and Moose consensus for re- views of observational studies, a reference da- tabase search was made of prospective studies conducted in adult patients, scheduled for non- cardiac surgery, with ultrasound performed by an anesthesiologist, for diagnosis or decision- making derived from the anesthetic act during the perioperative period. studies in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were excluded, as well as studies aimed at locating vascular access and peripheral nerve anesthesia. the following keywords and key terms were used as a strategy for bibliographic search in the electronic databases PubMed, MeDline, eMBase, cochrane and scielo: (“echogra- phy” or “ultrasound” or “ultrasonography” or “echocardiography” or “lung ultrasound” or “transthoracic echocardiography” or “transesophageal echocardiography”) anD (“anesthesia” or “anesthetic management” or “intensive care” or “critical ill” or “crit- ical care”) anD (“perioperative” or “intraop- erative” or “postoperative” or “postopera- tive outcomes” or “postanesthesia care unit” or “postsurgical care” or “adverse events”) not (“cardiac surgery” or “cardiothoracic surgery” or “vascular access” or “vascular cannulation” or “analgesia” or “regional anesthesia” or “nerve block” or “blockade”) COPYRIGHT © 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA This document is protected by international copyright laws.No additional reproduction is authorized.It is permitted for personal use to download and save only one file and print only one copy of this Article.It is not permitted to make additional copies(either sporadically or systematically, either printed or electronic) of the Article for any purpose.It is not permitted to distribute the electronic copy of the article through online internet and/or intranet file sharing systems, electronic mailing or any othermeans which may allow access to the Article.The use of all or any part of the Article for any Commercial Use is not permitted.The creation of derivative works from the Article is not permitted.The production of reprints for personal or commercial use isnot permitted.It is not permitted to remove, cover, overlay, obscure, block, or change any copyright notices or terms of use which the Publisher may post on the Article.It is not permitted to frame or use framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo,or other proprietary information of the Publisher.

PerioPerative Us in Diagnostics anD Decision MaKing Ferreira alBUQUerQUe costa vol. 84 - no. 1 Minerva anestesiologica 97 Discussion the objective of this review was to detect the impact of ultrasound performed by anesthesi- ologists in diagnosis and therapeutic decisions related to the perioperative and anesthesia act. the increasing interest in this area by anesthe- siology is verified in Figure 2 by the increased in number of publications in the last decade. it is noteworthy from this review that the in- dication to perform an ultrasound assessment throughout the decade has changed, being no longer only for hemodynamic assessment and with progressive adoption of examinations aimed to airway and respiratory assessment. nowadays, perioperative ultrasound explora- tion is multidisciplinary related to the clini- cal practice. it approaches a balance between hemodynamic and respiratory pathway areas assessment, with progressive use of comple- mentary ultrasound scans are attached as shown in Figure 2. transesophageal echocar- diography has apparently not been performed in the non-cardiac surgery patient, giving rise to transthoracic ultrasound. there is also a sig- nificant implantation of lung ultrasound, neck and laryngeal ultrasound examinations, as well as progressive interest in abdominal, renal and bladder examinations. the 19 papers analyzed have a wide variety of study designs with only three prospective, randomized trials. Despite the prospective and interventional design studies, only nine were clinical outcome studies that used controls for comparison. Blinding has not been verified in ten studies with the consequent high probabil- ity of observer and investigator bias. the most frequent therapeutic management changes mentioned were related to the predic- tion of difficult airway, the need for a tracheal or bronchial tube replacement, prevention of bronchoaspiration, anesthetic induction tech- nique altered, anticipation of inotropes and vasoconstrictors needs, adjustment of serum therapy, as well as reference to changes in sur- gical management. the most relevant aspects of the revised work are listed below. ramsingh et al.51 have compared the cor- rect results in the diagnosis of tracheal and tially benefit from a change in management. Of the 43 excluded studies, 15 had undergone trans- thoracic echocardiography,9, 11, 14, 18-28, 43 nine had pulmonary ultrasound,30, 31, 45-47, 49, 50, 52, 53 nine had echocardiography neck and larynx soft tis- sues,54-56, 58, 59, 61-64 in five transesophageal echo- cardiography 33-35, 37, 38 was done, four with kid- ney and bladder ultrasound 39-42 and one gastric ultrasound 70 assessment. table i provides an overview of the 19 full- text publications elected.10-13, 15-17, 29, 32, 36, 44, 48, 51, 57, 60, 65-69 Diagnostic ultrasound guidance was applied with airway or respiratory man- agement in ten studies,44, 48, 51, 57, 60, 65-69 while the change in decisions related to hemody- namic management was made in the remaining nine studies.10, 12, 13, 15-17, 29, 32, 36 in the ultrasound publications dedicated to the airway and respiratory assessment, three studies have the objective of verifying cor- rect diagnosis of orotracheal or bronchial in- tubation with pulmonary ultrasound.44, 48, 51 there were four studies whose objective was to prevent bronchoaspiration,66-69 detecting preoperative gastric content or gastric aspi- ration during ventilation with face mask in anesthesia induction. three studies are aimed to predicting difficult airway using neck and laryngeal ultrasonography.57, 60, 65 Publications related to hemodynamic sta- tus included transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography and pul- monary ultrasound and refer to new diagnosis of left ventricular dysfunction, valvular dis- ease, hypovolemia, hypervolemia, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunc- tion. in three studies, echocardiography was performed before surgery, in the preoperative anesthesia visit 15, 17, 18 and three in context of emergency surgery 19, 20, 43 with hemodynamic assessment.

Pulmonary ultrasonography could allow the diagnosis at the mid-tracheal level, as well as the diagno- sis of inadvertent bronchial intubation and left selective intubation. it can be performed in all surgical positions without changing the ultra- sound pattern by analyzing three ultrasound signs: pulmonary sliding, diaphragmatic am- plitude movement and lung pulse sign. bronchial intubation after verification of posi- tioning by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. When dif- ferentiating tracheal intubation with bronchial intubation, auscultation had a sensitivity of 66% (95% CI: 0.39 to 0.87) and a specificity of 59% (95% ci: 0.39 to 0.77), while ultrasound presents a sensitivity of 93% (95% ci: 0.66 to 0.99) and specificity of 96% (95% CI: 0.79 to 1). The correct identification of tracheal and bronchial intubation was 62% (26 of 42) in the auscultation group and 95% (95% ci: 40 of 42) in the ultrasound group (P=0.0005) (ci for the difference of 0.15 to 0.52). Álvarez-Díaz et al.44 comparing the diagnosis of left selec- tive intubation with double-lumen tube and positioning also assisted by fiberoptic bron- choscopy, obtained that the sensitivity of the auscultation clinical method was 84.5% and the specificity was 41.1% while the ultrasound method had a sensitivity of 98.6% and speci- ficity of 52.9% identifying the correct position of tube. in a similar study, Parab et al.48 report that the addition of pulmonary ultrasound to the standard clinical method improves sen- sitivity (75% vs. 88%), specificity (18% vs. 75%), and accuracy (57% vs. 85 %) predict- Figure 3.—a) Meta-analysis of anesthetic management change in proportion with heterogeneity; B) forest plot of studies for management change proportion; c) funnel plot of studies for proportion of change in diagnosis.10-13, 15-17, 29, 32, 36, 44, 48, 51, 57, 60, 65-69 a B c Álvarez-Díaz et al. 2015 Andruszkiewicz et al. 2015 Arzola et al. 2015 Bøtker et al. 2014 Bouvet et al. 2011 Bouvet et al. 2014 Canty et al. 2009 Canty et al. 2012 Canty et al. 2012 Cowie et al. 2011 Hui et al. 2014 Jay et al. 2016 Parab et al. 2015 Pinto et al. 2016 Ramsingh et al. 2014 Schulmeyer et al. 2006 You-Ten et al. 2015 Zhang et al. 2016 Zieleskiewicz et al. 2014 Total (fixed effects) Total (random effects) Proportion ProportionStandard error COPYRIGHT © 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA This document is protected by international copyright laws.No additional reproduction is authorized.It is permitted for personal use to download and save only one file and print only one copy of this Article.It is not permitted to make additional copies(either sporadically or systematically, either printed or electronic) of the Article for any purpose.It is not permitted to distribute the electronic copy of the article through online internet and/or intranet file sharing systems, electronic mailing or any othermeans which may allow access to the Article.The use of all or any part of the Article for any Commercial Use is not permitted.The creation of derivative works from the Article is not permitted.The production of reprints for personal or commercial use isnot permitted.It is not permitted to remove, cover, overlay, obscure, block, or change any copyright notices or terms of use which the Publisher may post on the Article.It is not permitted to frame or use framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo,or other proprietary information of the Publisher.

Bouvet et al.68 us- ing antral cross-sectional area measurements (CSA) found a significant positive relationship between antral CSA and gastric aspirate fluid volume, with a cutoff value of antral csa of 340 mm2 reported a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 71% for the diagnosis of stom- ach at risk. in a later study, Jay et al.69 for the diagnosis of grade 0, the cut value for the an- tral area measured in the supine position was 381 mm2 (sensitivity 81%, specificity 76%, and negative predictive value 80%). to detect gastric insufflation during facial mask ven- tilation, Bouvet et al.67 reported statistically significant increases in incidence of insuffla- tion with inspiratory pressure from 0% (P10 group) to 41% (P25 group) for auscultation and 19% to 59% for ultrasonography, whereas in the groups with inspiratory pressure P20 and P25 the detection of gastric insufflation by ultrasonography was associated with a statis- tically significant increase in the antral area. the ultrasound evaluation of gastric contents requires exploration in both right lateral and supine decubitus positions. this change in position may entails limitations in certain pa- tients as is the case of an obstetric emergency. therefore, for the assessment of gastric con- tent, it is particularly appropriate to describe a scan and analysis of supine data enabling the rapid diagnosis of a full or an empty stomach. another limitation is that the results described are based on the comparison of data provided by a single technique (antral area ultrasound), with the gastric volume not being confirmed with another non-invasive method. regarding the studies performed for he- modynamic management, andruszkiewicz et al.10 report concordance of diagnosis between anesthesiologist and cardiologist with a sen- In difficult airway prediction studies, Hui and tsui 57 report that the visibility of hyoid bone by sublingual ultrasound was associated with a cormack-lehane grade 1-2 of laryngoscopy presenting a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 97% to predict difficult laryngoscopy and intubation. Ultrasound identification of hyoid was observed in 96.6% (86/89) of easy intuba- tions (grades 1-2), while in 8/11 (72.7%) pa- tients with grade 3-4 views of cormack-lehane the hyoid failed to be identified. Pinto et al.60 found an association between difficult laryn- goscopy and increased epiglottis fur distance (P<0.001), with a cut-off value of 27.5 mm pre- dicting difficult laryngoscopy had an accuracy of 74.3%, a sensitivity of 64.7% and a speci- ficity of 77.1%. Also related to difficult airway prediction, You-ten et al.65 in women sched- uled for elective caesarean section, reports an accurate digital palpation identification of the cricothyroid membrane in only 39% (11/28) of the obese patients compared to 71% (20/28) of the non-obese patients (P=0.03), being pos- sible the identification by ultrasound in 100% of the patients. it seems still early to conclude that ultrasound can be used as a predictor of a difficult airway. The studies analyzed, all select- ed the cormack-lehane grade of iii and iv as the variable that most correlates with a difficult laryngoscopy. in an article by You-ten et al.65 describing a study oriented to the location of the cricoid membrane, laryngoscopy was not per- formed. Pinto et al.60 report to use BUrP during intubation, which may provide a better view of the difficult laryngoscopy degree. Paralysis as a standard component of induction and the use of neuromuscular block was confirmed in the two studies in which laryngoscopy was performed. the articles reviewed have marked differences in population at study, with the only common characteristic of being on an adult population. it should be emphasized that the prediction of difficult airway requires exploration and analy- sis of multiple scales, so that an isolated com- parison of ultrasound entry of soft tissues of the neck or larynx compared to a single predictor has no clinical significance. in the four ultrasound articles of gastric content assessment studies, arzola et al.66 in COPYRIGHT © 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA This document is protected by international copyright laws.No additional reproduction is authorized.It is permitted for personal use to download and save only one file and print only one copy of this Article.It is not permitted to make additional copies(either sporadically or systematically, either printed or electronic) of the Article for any purpose.It is not permitted to distribute the electronic copy of the article through online internet and/or intranet file sharing systems, electronic mailing or any othermeans which may allow access to the Article.The use of all or any part of the Article for any Commercial Use is not permitted.The creation of derivative works from the Article is not permitted.The production of reprints for personal or commercial use isnot permitted.It is not permitted to remove, cover, overlay, obscure, block, or change any copyright notices or terms of use which the Publisher may post on the Article.It is not permitted to frame or use framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo,or other proprietary information of the Publisher.

Preoperative transthoracic echocar- diograms performed on the day of surgery (n.=39) led to two surgery cancellations due to terminal heart disease, implantation of two unplanned surgical procedures (drain- age of pleural and pericardial effusions), and significant changes in anesthesia or hemody- namics in 18 patients.

Conclusions Ultrasound applied to diagnosis and thera- peutic decision making derived from the an- esthesia performance, is an emergent element of the perioperative evaluation in non-cardiac surgery patients. Despite the increase in re- lated publications, the evidence base for its use remains largely confined to uncontrolled observational studies. From the studies pub- lished so far, the impact on diagnosis and clinical decision making is well described. as most of the articles were observational studies with inherent design flaws, there is an urgent requirement for randomized controlled trials in this area. Despite their cost and time limi- tations, randomized control trials are essen- tial to determine whether diagnostic accuracy can translate into better patient outcome. as anesthesiologists become more comfortable and knowledgeable in ultrasound applied to perioperative anesthesiology support increase, the emergence of protocols with multiple ul- trasound exploration is expected to increase perioperative safety. Key messages — Ultrasound is an emergent element that determines diagnosis, decision making and management changes by anesthesiolo- gists during perioperative of non-cardiac surgery patients. — Perioperative ultrasound is associ- ated with more changes in management having impact in diagnosis and decision making of anesthesiologists. — Despite the lack of randomized con- trolled trials, multidisciplinary ultrasound exploration is expected to improve periop- erative safety. 90 cm/s, P=0.05) and the increase in the E/Eʹ ratio (9.9 vs. 6.6 and P<0.001). in the studies included in this review related to hemodynamic assessment we detected some important limitations to consider. studies that report the mean age of the cohort undergoing ultrasound examination vary widely between studies, with one of the studies being done in pregnant women cohort with preeclampsia. since the prevalence of cardiac disease is sub- stantially greater in patients over 65 years, this will inevitably result in more changes in pa- tient management and overestimating the im- pact of echocardiography. on the other hand, indications for performing ultrasound control differed between studies, so that in studies with consecutive screening, less pathologic changes are expected and therefore less impact compared to studies performed for suspected valvular disease, ventricular dysfunction or pre-eclampsia. the change in management derived from ultrasound is summarized in the forest plot Figure 3 10-13, 15-17, 29, 32, 36, 44, 48, 51, 57, 60, 65-69 and it oscillated between 10.56% (95% ci: 6.48 to 15.99) and 82.35% (95% ci: 75.8 to 87.76), conditioned in global terms a decision change in 31.05% of patients (95% ci: 21.06 to 42.04). For odds ratio association measure of secondary management change to periop- erative ultrasound diagnosis, cross-sectional studies,10, 12, 13, 15-17, 29, 32, 36 studies without masking 10, 12, 13, 15-17, 32, 36, 65, 66 and studies with missing data related to the intervention to be compared 68, 69 were excluded. the association of ultrasound diagnosis in perioperative decision making is summarized in the statistical analysis Figure 4,44, 48, 51, 57, 60, 68 resulting in an odds ratio of 2.68 (95% ci: 1.77 to 4.06). the impact es- timate is summarized in Figure 5,44, 48, 51, 57, 60, 68 resulting from its calculation a risk difference of 0.169 (95% ci: 0.1 to 0.24). When analyzing the impact of ultrasound on the change in therapeutic management in the 19 studies, significant heterogeneity was found (I2=95.94% and Q=443.53). We found low het- erogeneity (I2=23% and Q=6.52), allowing us to accept the calculated odds ratio, with low- moderate heterogeneity in the studies included COPYRIGHT © 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA This document is protected by international copyright laws.No additional reproduction is authorized.It is permitted for personal use to download and save only one file and print only one copy of this Article.It is not permitted to make additional copies(either sporadically or systematically, either printed or electronic) of the Article for any purpose.It is not permitted to distribute the electronic copy of the article through online internet and/or intranet file sharing systems, electronic mailing or any othermeans which may allow access to the Article.The use of all or any part of the Article for any Commercial Use is not permitted.The creation of derivative works from the Article is not permitted.The production of reprints for personal or commercial use isnot permitted.It is not permitted to remove, cover, overlay, obscure, block, or change any copyright notices or terms of use which the Publisher may post on the Article.It is not permitted to frame or use framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo,or other proprietary information of the Publisher.
