{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240221155949.png","text":"The ROTEM® analyser uses a modification of this technology; 300 I of whole blood with activators is incubated in a disposable cuvette (four parallel channels) and placed in a heated (37°C) holder. A pin fixed on a steel axis stabi- lized by a ball bearing is immersed into the blood. A spring rotates the pin in either direction while the cuvette stays stationary. The initial un- restricted rotation of the pin starts to encounter increasing impedance as the clot strength increases. This is detected by an optical system consisting of a light-emitting diode, a mirror on the steel axis, and an electronic camera, and is translated into the characteristic tracing from which again various parameters are derived.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
