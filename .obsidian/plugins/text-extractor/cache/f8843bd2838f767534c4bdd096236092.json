SYNCHRONISED INTERMITTENT MANDATORY VENTILATION WITH PRESSURE CONTROL AND VOLUME GUARANTEE (SIMV-PCV-VG) This is a combination of the SIMV-PC and PC-VG described previously. It starts by giving a Volume test breath to determine the lung compliance. Subsequent mandatory breaths are then delivered by a pressure controlled mode and adjusted to obtain the set Tidal Volume according to the patient’s lung compliance. The patient can also breathe spontaneously within the ‘trigger window’ with a pressure supported breath.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
