Although the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) increased with hyperoxaemia in cardiac patients (those with congestive cardiac failure, coronary artery disease and those undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting) as well as in healthy individuals, the SVR did not increase in hyperoxaemic septic patients. The cardiac output fell in healthy volunteers and those patients with coronary artery disease and congestive cardiac failure (CCF), mostly due to a reduction in heart rate, but the cardiac output was not affected in patients with sepsis. There was no evidence that hyperoxaemia reverses the vasoplegia experienced in septic patients. Caution should be taken on the provision of superfluous oxygen supplementation in patients with cardiac diséase, given the potentially significant decrease in cardiac output and increase in SVR demonstrated in this meta-analysis. There is very new data emerging that the use of high F0, can alter the lung microbiota, which may be a factor in the development of Acute Lung Injury (ALI). The use of high F0, decreases the presence of anaerobic organisms, and this “ecological space” is filled by Staphylococcal organisms. There is an increase in Staphylococcal infections in the setting of hyperoxia. For anaesthetists The NICE guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infections recommend maintaining the oxygen saturation of haemoglobin as >95%, the WHO guidelines suggest an F0, of 0.8. However, these guidelines (amongst others) are not hased on great evidence, with old studies {only 1 study in the past 5 years). The only study to reach statistical significance was in those patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Although there is no harm with hyperoxaemia shown In these studies, there is no demonstrable significant benefit either! Personally, I think that the use of other SSI preventative strategies such as proper skin prep, shaving and antibiotics are more important than inducing hyperoxaemia.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
