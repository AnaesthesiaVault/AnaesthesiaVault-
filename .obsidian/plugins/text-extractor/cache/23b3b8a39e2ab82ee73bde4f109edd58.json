Anaesthetic Goals Avoid drugs that may be teratogenic. Use regional anesthesia whenever possible. Avoid precipitating preterm labor by reducing sympathetic stimulation. Prevent awareness during anesthesia. Communication between the anesthetist and obstetrician. Address coexisting medical conditions. General Regional anesthesia preferred to reduce fetal drug exposure and avoid airway manipulation. Laparoscopy should be done in the second trimester if necessary, avoiding the third trimester to prevent uterine damage. Nonurgent sugery should be performed in the second Timing of Surgery == trimester to minimize risks of preterm contractions and spontaneous abortion. Increased sensitivity to volatile anaesthetic agents, with decreased MAC values. Non-Obstetric Surgery Volatile agents (<1.5 MAC) dilate uterine arteries and Anaesthetic Considerations increase uterine blood flow but may decrease maternal arterial pressure and cardiac output at higher concentrations.
