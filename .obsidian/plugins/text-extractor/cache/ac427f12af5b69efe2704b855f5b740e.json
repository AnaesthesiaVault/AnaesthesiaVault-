The amplitude of the ventilator assist is determined by the instantaneous EAdi and the NAVA level set by the clinician. In particular, NAVA improves patient-ventilator interaction, averting the risk of over-assistance and limiting the occurrence of asynchronies.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
