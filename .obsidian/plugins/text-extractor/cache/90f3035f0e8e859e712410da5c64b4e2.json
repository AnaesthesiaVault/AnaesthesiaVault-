Tissue Factor activation of the TEG enables the maximal amplitude (MA) to be established within 10 minutes but will result in significant shortening of the reaction time (R value) and as a result much of this latter information is lost. R Time and Heparinase The R value in a native TEG is sensitive to trace amounts of heparin and endogenously released Heparan sulphate. The use of a heparinase-coated reaction cuvette for the TEG will demonstrate any heparin present in the sample or in the patient and enables assessment of haemostasis in patients who are fully anticoagulated with heparin e.g. on CPB. Tissue factor/kaolin By incorporating both Tissue Factor and Kaolin into the TEG cuvette, the TEG approximates to the Activated Clotting activated TEG and the ACT Time [ACT] Fibrinogen and platelet The MAis primarily a reflection of clot strength and is affected by changes in fibrinogen, platelet count and function function The MA is established either from a native sample with no activator or from the combined Tissue Factor/Kaolin activated TEG. There is a strong linear correlation between the log platelet count and MA Abciximab is a potent platelet Gplilb/lia inhibitor and an Abciximab-modified TEG can help to discriminate between hypofibrinogenemia and platelet dysfunction as a cause of a decreased MA Fibrinolysis The degree of fibrinolysis can be established from either a native sample with no activator, from the Tissue Factor activator or the combined Tissue Factor/Kaolin activated TEG Hyperfibrinolysis s increasingly recognised as a cause of perioperative microvascular bieeding and is readily detected by analysing the clot ysis index on the TEG or ROTEM The ability to detect and determine the severity of fiorinolysis avoids empirical or inappropriate anti-fibrinolytic therapy. Mathematical derivations of changes in elastic modulus derived from the amplitude have been used to quantify the extent of fibrinolysis in clinical and laboratory settings. as well as to guide antifibrinolytic therapy Hypercoagulability The TEG may be helpful in screening for hypercoagulable states. TEG analysis of patients with a history of thromboembolic complications showed shorter R values and accelerated clot propagation compared to healthy reference subjects PlateletMapping TEG The TEG PlateletMappingÂ® assay provides a method for testing the ability of platelets to participate in clot formation with and without the contribution of anti-platelet drugs. The assay involves four separate analyses on whole blood 1. AKaolin-activated TEG which generates Thrombin to activate platelets and cleave fibrinogen. This provides a measurement of overall clot strength 2 A TEG In which heparin is used to inactivate Thrombin and Reptilase and Factor Xil are used generate a fibrin clot and to isolate the fibrin contribution to overall clot strength 3. An ADP TEG in which platelets are activated using ADP. This TEG includes Reptilase and Factor Xl 4. An Arachidonic Acid TEG which activate the platelets via the TxA2 pathway. This TEG includes Reptilase and Factor Xil By comparing the relative clot strengths of the 4 assays, it is possible to determine the degree of platelet innibition in the presence of defined anti-platelet agents.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
