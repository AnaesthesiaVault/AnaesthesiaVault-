Muscle biopsy that is exposed to caffeine and halothane (compounds that activate Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through RYRL). The intensity of the contracture is measured to assess likelihood of developing malignant hyperthermia. b. Masseter muscle rigidity is one of the earliest signs of MH during anesthesia. . Unanticipated doubling or tripling of end-tidal CO, (in the absence of a ventilator change) is one of the earliest and most sensitive indicators of MH. d. Prominent in the absence of muscle relaxant use or controlled ventilation.
