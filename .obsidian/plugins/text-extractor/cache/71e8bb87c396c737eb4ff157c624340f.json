Conventional nasal cannula are commonly used deliver low flow rates & moderate Fi02. PHYSIOLOGY OF HEATED HiGH FLOW NASAL CANNULA * High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) delivers higher flow rates achieving a higher * Higher flow washes out €02 from anatomical dead space in the nasopharynx Fi02 with greater patient comfort. « Higher flow overcomes resistance against expiratory flow and creates a small positive In hypoxemic respiratory failure use of HENC is associated with a lower rate nasopharyngeal pressure (approximately 0.7 cmH20 of PEEP for every 10 Ipm of flow) of requiring intubation & lower ICU mortality compared to CNCor NIPPY. * Patients in respiratory distress generate high flows and will entrain ambient air with HFNC can prevent re-intubation after thoracic and cardiac surgeries. conventional nasal cannula. HFNC can match demand so F/0, remains relatively constant Extubation to HFNC is also associated with lower rates of re-intubation. * Warm humidified gas preserves mucociliary function & is more comfortable for patients For low flow 02 delivery systems, only the flow rate For high flow O2 delivery systems two parameters. s specified.
