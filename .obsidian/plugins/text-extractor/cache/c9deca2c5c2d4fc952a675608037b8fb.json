The majority of existing ultrasound protocols have been developed and implemented in high‑resource settings. In sub‑ Saharan Africa (SSA), patients with heart failure of various etiologies commonly present late in the disease process, with a similar syndrome of dyspnea, edema and cardiomegaly on chest X‑ray. The causes of heart failure in SSA differ from those in high‑resource settings. Point‑of‑care ultrasound has the potential to identify the underlying etiology of heart failure, and lead to targeted therapy. Based on a literature review and weighted score of disease prevalence, diagnostic impact and difficulty in performing the ultrasound, we propose a context‑specific cardiac ultrasound pro‑ tocol to help differentiate patients presenting with heart failure in SSA. Results: Pericardial effusion, dilated cardiomyopathy, cor pulmonale, mitral valve disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy were identified as target conditions for a focused ultrasound protocol in patients with cardiac failure and cardiomegaly in SSA. By utilizing a simplified 5‑question approach with all images obtained from the subxiphoid view, the protocol is suitable for use by health care professionals with limited ultrasound experience. Conclusions: The “Cardiac ultrasound for resource‑limited settings (CURLS)” protocol is a context‑specific algorithm designed to aid the clinician in diagnosing the five most clinically relevant etiologies of heart failure and cardiomegaly in SSA. The protocol has the potential to influence treatment decisions in patients who present with clinical signs of heart failure in resource‑limited settings outside of the traditional referral institutions.

Background Point-of-care ultrasound is increasingly being used as a diagnostic tool in resource-limited settings. With more portable and affordable machines, providers from small clinics to large hospitals have increasing access to this technology. The majority of ultrasound protocols aimed at cardiac pathology have been developed and imple- mented in high-resource settings where more advanced imaging technology is usually available to help the clinician confirm their ultrasound diagnosis. As cardio- vascular disease is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [1], there is a need for context-specific ultrasound protocols suited to the needs and available resources in this setting. In SSA, patients with heart disease often present late in their clinical course with signs and symptoms of heart failure [2]. The etiology of heart disease in this context falls into several categories which are difficult to distinguish at the end stages, including hyperten- sion and coronary artery disease [3], as well as com- municable diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and rheumatic fever [3]. There are striking differences in Open Access *Correspondence: echnatom@web.de 6 Lighthouse Clinic, Kamuzu Central Hospital, Lilongwe, Malawi Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 10Huson et al. Ultrasound J (2019) 11:34 the epidemiology of heart diseases when comparing SSA with the United States or Europe [4]. Based on a number of studies comparing patients from SSA with patients from Europe, the Americas and Asia, African patients with heart failure are younger, more likely to be female and less likely to suffer from ischemic heart disease [4–6]. Patients with heart failure of various etiologies com- monly present with a similar syndrome of dyspnea, edema and cardiomegaly on chest X-ray. In tropical set- tings common cardiac causes of dyspnea and edema are dilated cardiomyopathy (e.g., peripartum or HIV-asso- ciated cardiomyopathy), hypertensive cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion with tamponade (most commonly due to TB), post-rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and cor pulmonale [7, 8]. Point-of-care ultrasound may be the only tool available to clinicians to help them make defini- tive diagnoses allowing for targeted treatment. A large body of evidence has demonstrated the feasibil- ity and clinical utility of point-of-care cardiac ultrasound performed by non-cardiologists [9–13]. In SSA, stud- ies on handheld echocardiography showed promising results in screening children for RHD by both cardiolo- gists and non-experts, trained in a simplified screening protocol [9–11, 14, 15]. In addition, focused cardiopul- monary ultrasound was demonstrated to improve diag- nostic accuracy in emergency care in Ghana, particularly in patients with cardiac disease such as cardiogenic shock, congestive heart failure or acute valvular disease [16]. More widespread use of echocardiography in low- and middle-income countries beyond referral centers has great potential. A recent study performed in a district hospital in South Africa demonstrated that patient man- agement was influenced by echocardiography in 83.8% of patients, who predominantly suffered from valvu- lar heart disease [17]. A study in Rwanda demonstrated that trained nurses were able to accurately diagnose dif- ferent causes of heart failure and provide care for heart failure patients using a simplified echocardiography pro- tocol [18]. Similarly clinical officers in Kenya were able to improve their diagnosis of cardiac conditions using a focused protocol after an 8-h training [12]. These stud- ies demonstrate the numerous applications and practical possibilities to expand the use of echocardiography in SSA. As ultrasound becomes more ubiquitous, there is a need for context-specific training protocols. In the fol- lowing pages, we outline a cardiac ultrasound protocol specifically for providers working in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This protocol is based on a literature review of locally prevalent conditions, and created for ease of use both in regards to performing ultrasound with basic B mode software capabilities and for teaching cardiac ultrasound in a way that is most relevant for healthcare professionals in SSA. Methods Literature review on prevalence of cardiac conditions We searched PubMed with the following search string: “Africa” [MeSH Terms] AND “heart diseases” [MeSH Terms] and extracted information on the frequency of causes of heart failure. Our search was conducted on 1 August 2018, and an additional search on 11 October 2019. We limited our search to papers published in the last 5 years and relevant references cited herein published within the last 10 years. We excluded papers focusing on pediatric populations, ECG findings, surgery, cardiovas- cular risk or stroke, studies outside SSA, case reports and studies focusing on clinical characteristics of specific groups, such as HIV patients or patients with congenital heart disease. Review papers were included to search for additional relevant references. Geographic area, number of assessed patients and relative frequencies of underly- ing conditions were extracted. These data were subse- quently used to identify the most relevant conditions that need to be assessed in a cardiac ultrasound protocol. Weighting of cardiac ultrasound application Given that our goal is to create a protocol that is most relevant for clinicians in resource-limited settings, epi- demiology was combined with ease of use and predicted clinical relevance to create a scoring system that would identify the high-yield ultrasound applications. Each application was assessed on three components: dis- ease prevalence, diagnostic impact, and ultrasound dif- ficulty (Table  1). The weight of disease prevalence was based on data from our literature review. We considered approximate average frequencies above 15% as frequent (weight = 3) and below 5% as rare (weight = 1). As the populations under study varied in age and sex distribu- tion, and may thus not be comparable, no overall aver- age prevalence was calculated. Prevalence was weighted as 3 if the prevalence was > 15% in the majority of stud- ies. Weighting ultrasound difficulty was based on expert consensus between co-authors with experience in ultra- sound teaching in resource-limited settings (TH, DKam, MH, VK, BK); weight of therapeutic impact by consen- sus of co-authors experienced in treating cardiac patients in clinical practice in these settings (DKah, PG, CW). Although the multifactorial weighting model has not been formally validated and the weights are partially subjective, the method first proposed by Van Hoving et al. [19] is transparent and easy to apply. Therefore, we consider it currently the best option to inform decisions about relevant curriculum content in various settings. The weighting of cardiac ultrasound applications allowed Page 3 of 10Huson et al. Ultrasound J (2019) 11:34 us to generate a protocol for focused cardiac ultrasound in resource-limited settings (CURLS) that is based on the most relevant applications and prioritizes practicality and ease of use for non-expert sonographers. Results Epidemiology of heart disease in sub‑Saharan Africa 878 titles and abstracts were screened; nine papers provided relevant information on etiologies of car- diac failure in SSA [20–28], nine additional papers were identified by reviewing references [18, 29–36]. Geographic distribution of the study areas of included studies is presented in Fig.  1, showing the wide geo- graphic range. The literature review flowchart and baseline characteristics of included studies are given in Additional file  1: Figure S1 and Table  S1. Relative frequencies of the etiologies of heart failure are sum- marized in Table  2. Hypertension was the most com- mon cause of heart failure in all studies, except in one study from Djibouti where ischemic heart disease was the most common cause [32]. Cardiomyopathy was the second most common cause in most studies.

Endomyocardial fibrosis, pericardial effu- sion, cor pulmonale and congenital causes were only reported by a selected number of publications and their frequency was low. The cardiac ultrasound in resource‑limited settings (CURLS) protocol Based on the 5 highest ranking conditions (Table  3), we propose a protocol that focuses on the identifica- tion of pericardial effusion, dilated cardiomyopathy, cor pulmonale, rheumatic mitral disease, and left ven- tricular hypertrophy. The proposed protocol answers 5 key questions summarized in Box 1. All 5 questions can be answered using a single subxiphoid view in B mode. More advanced sonographers have the option of addi- tional views as outlined in Table 4 (Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Box 1: Cardiac ultrasound in resource‑limited settings (CURLS) protocol—5 questions CURLS protocol: 5 questions Interpretation 1. Is a pericardial effusion present? Yes: consider cardiac tamponade No: consider alternative cause of heart failure 2. Is the left ventricular function reduced? Yes: consider cardiomyopathy of various causes No: consider alternative cause of heart failure 3. Is the right ventricle larger than the left ventricle? Yes: consider pulmonary artery hypertension or pulmonary embolism No: consider alternative cause of heart failure 4. Is the left atrium larger than the left ventricle? Yes: consider mitral stenosis or regurgitation, possibly caused by rheumatic heart disease No: Consider alternative cause of heart failure 5. Is the left ventricle wall (septum) thicker than 12 mm? Yes: consider hypertension, or aortic stenosis/regurgitation No: consider alternative cause of heart failure 1. Is a pericardial effusion present? Pericardial effusion is easily identified in a subxiphoid view and usually presents as an anechoic rim around the heart. If a significant pericardial effusion is present, the heart should be evaluated for signs of tamponade. If jugular veins are distended, the patient has tachycar- dia and low blood pressure, obstructive shock and tam- ponade may be present. Right atrial systolic collapse and right ventricle (RV) diastolic collapse suggest tamponade physiology. It is important to be aware that if the rate of fluid accumulation is rapid, even a small effusion can cause hemodynamic compromise. In a patient with car- diac tamponade emergency pericardiocentesis can be life-saving. In resource-limited settings an ultrasound- guided intercostal approach with a simple cannula can be used [37]. 2. Is the left ventricular function reduced? Dilated cardiomyopathy can have multiple causes, but sonographically, the end stage is similar with global enlargement of both atria and ventricles with reduced left ventricular systolic function. Unfortunately, most symp- tomatic patients present in a late stage of the disease. For- mal measurement of the ejection fraction and assessment of regional wall motion abnormalities is mostly confined to referral centers as it requires dedicated echocardio- graphic software and substantial experience. However, a broad classification of left ventricular contractility as hyperdynamic, normal, moderately impaired and severely impaired, can be made by estimating whether contrac- tion is symmetrical towards the center, whether the myo- cardium thickens as it contracts, and whether the mitral valve opens normally during diastole. In an enlarged heart, this can usually be achieved in a subxiphoid view. 3. Is the right ventricle larger than the left ventricle? An enlarged RV can indicate cor pulmonale. Cardiac ultrasound can demonstrate sonographic features of cor pulmonale by evaluating shape, size and pressure of the right side of the heart. In the subxiphoid view, in the presence of a normal-sized left ventricle (LV), the RV is typically 2/3 the size of the LV, any larger suggests RV enlargement. If the RV is equal in size to the LV, it is considered moderately enlarged. Pronounced dilatation of the RV such that it is larger than the LV is considered severe RV enlargement and cor pulmonale may be con- sidered. In addition, movement of the intraventricular septum away from the RV indicates increased right ven- tricular pressure or volume, resulting in a D-shaped LV in the parasternal short axis view (optional view). The measurement of RV contractility and the calculation of the pressure gradient in the setting of tricuspid regurgita- tion can be helpful. However, this is technically more dif- ficult and requires Doppler software, so it is best reserved for referral sites. 4. Is the left atrium larger than the left ventricle? An enlarged left atrium (LA) is a feature of mitral steno- sis and/or regurgitation, which may serve as a surrogate marker for RHD. The LA often becomes larger than the normal-sized LV by the time the patient presents. Addi- tional findings include a thickened mitral valve with a diastolic hockey stick appearance or “doming” of the Page 6 of 10Huson et al.

Ultrasound J (2019) 11:34 valve leaflets. The right heart may also be enlarged due to the subsequent increase in pulmonary pressures. Post- rheumatic changes of the aortic valve are slightly more difficult to detect as they initially lead to left ventricular hypertrophy only and the aortic valve is more difficult to visualize on ultrasound from a subxiphoid view. The morphological assessment of the aortic valve is possible at referral centers, as is the detection of mitral and aortic regurgitation if color-Doppler is available. For the basic CURLS exam, these questions were not included. 5. Is the left ventricle wall (septum) thicker than 12 mm? Left ventricular hypertrophy can be determined by meas- uring the intra-ventricular septum (IVS) at end diastole. The standard measurement of the IVS is performed in the parasternal long axis view and should be less than 12  mm. Nevertheless, the septum is generally visible in the subxiphoid view. The clinician should freeze the screen and scroll back to end diastole where the IVS is measured at the level of the mitral valve leaflet tips. Discussion The clinical syndrome of heart failure is prevalent around the world. However, the underlying pathology differs sig- nificantly between resource-limited and resource-affluent settings. Ischemic heart disease is the main underlying cause in high-resource settings, but is only observed in a minority of patients in SSA. On the other hand, dilated cardiomyopathy, RHD and pericarditis (mostly TB- related) are important causes of heart failure in resource- limited settings, which are less prevalent in high-resource settings. Limited cardiac ultrasound can play a significant role in differentiating between underlying causes. Based on our analysis of the frequency of cardiac conditions, the impact on treatment decisions and the ease of use, we identified five cardiac conditions relevant to SSA for the CURLS protocol. The protocol should serve in emer- gency departments or acute patient settings and is not intended for screening asymptomatic patients. Our literature search identified hypertension as the most common cause of heart failure followed by dilated cardiomyopathy and valvular causes. Pericardial effusion and cor pulmonale were less frequently reported, but play a significant role in sub-populations such as HIV- infected patients. Our suggested “cardiac ultrasound for the resource-limited setting” (CURLS) protocol aims to identify these conditions in the “5-question” approach summarized in Box  1 and Table  4. The first question addresses pericardial effusion. Although less common then the other cardiac conditions, it is very easy to rec- ognize and can have life-threatening implications when present. In African patients effusions that mimic con- gestive heart failure are a common presenting sign of TB [38]. Tuberculosis is the most common cause of pericar- ditis in Africa. In a South African study, TB pericarditis was responsible for 70% of all cases referred for diagnos- tic pericardiocentesis and 96% of those who were HIV infected [39]. The second question assesses LV function as dilated cardiomyopathy was the second most com- mon cause of heart failure in SSA in our literature review, accounting for approximately 20% of cases in most stud- ies. Causative factors include myocarditis, HIV-asso- ciated cardiomyopathy, alcohol, nutritional deficiency, thyrotoxicosis and pregnancy. In some areas, iron over- load and other metabolic factors may play a role [40]. HIV-associated cardiomyopathy is reported in 9–57% of patients who are HIV-positive in Africa [41]. The third question focuses on RV size to detect cor pulmonale. While chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmo- nary hypertension secondary to left-sided heart failure are seen in all settings, chronic fibrocavitary TB is a frequent underlying cause in Africa [42]. In addition, HIV, schis- tosomiasis, and pulmonary embolism can lead to chronic pulmonary hypertension eventually resulting in cor pul- monale [43, 44]. Moreover, patients with HIV may suf- fer from HIV-associated pulmonary artery hypertension. The fourth question considers left atrial size to assess for sequelae of mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation. In contrast to high-resource settings, where valvular disease is largely degenerative in origin, in Africa valvular disease is almost invariably the result of infectious disease, either directly in infective endocarditis, or indirectly, following acute rheumatic disease [45]. Whereas degenerative val- vular disease afflicts mainly the elderly, RHD is encoun- tered in young, school-age children or young females of childbearing age. The course of RHD is more rapid than in degenerative disease and predisposes to cardiac failure, secondary endocarditis, atrial fibrillation and stroke [46]. Most patients with RHD have mixed mitral valve stenosis and regurgitation [47]. Aortic regurgitation is seen in less than 50% of the patients and it is found almost always in combination with mitral valve disease; aortic stenosis is rare [48]. Finally, the protocol addresses left ventricular hypertrophy, generally the result of uncontrolled hyper- tension. The prevalence of hypertension is high in many African settings, and remains frequently undiagnosed and inadequately treated [49]. It is therefore a frequently identified etiology for cardiac failure in SSA [50]. Ultrasound protocols designed specifically for resource-limited settings have proven effective in SSA. Heller et al. demonstrated that the FASH (focused assess- ment with sonography for HIV-associated tuberculo- sis) exam could be efficiently taught to ultrasound-naïve clinicians over a 2-day training period [51]. The FASH exam has now become widely established as an impor- tant ultrasound exam for clinicians working in African Page 8 of 10Huson et al. Ultrasound J (2019) 11:34 settings with a high burden of HIV [52]. Similar success in ultrasound training has been demonstrated with the application of the 10-point yes/no checklist for various point-of-care ultrasound applications in a tertiary refer- ral hospital in Tanzania [53]. Recently, a study in Kenya demonstrated the utility of a focused cardiac protocol applied in patient care by clinical officers [54]. Henwood et  al. also demonstrated that a longitudinal ultrasound training program could detect basic cardiac abnormali- ties with high sensitivity and specificity when compared to experienced sonographer interpretation [55]. These studies suggest that implementation of a focused CURLS protocol is feasible. Some limitations of the protocol should be high- lighted. The protocol has not been validated in clinical practice, so its sensitivity and specificity still need to be determined. While the use of only the subxiphoid view simplifies the protocol for non-expert sonographers, it is possible that the image quality is insufficient in some patients. Furthermore, as with any focused protocol, it is not a replacement of an expert cardiology ultrasound and difficult cases should be referred for more extensive workup. Finally, no evidence is available that the protocol enhances diagnosis of cardiac pathologies in resource- limited settings. Hence, the protocol we outline here is set forward as a research agenda and discussion point to encourage all providers to think about how the incredible potential of ultrasound can become more context spe- cific for both patients and providers. Future studies need to assess if the CURLS protocol is trainable and whether significant cardiac findings are missed in comparison to “full specialist” echo exam even though this is not widely available. Conclusions Based on the epidemiology of heart disease in sub-Saha- ran Africa and expert consensus on difficulty and impact of cardiac sonographic examinations, we propose a pro- tocol for screening symptomatic patients with signs of heart failure and/or cardiomegaly on chest X-ray in resource-limited settings. This protocol is unique in that uses primarily the subxiphoid view and is designed to have high clinical relevance whilst being easy to use for providers at the front line of patient care in these settings. The protocol assesses pericardial effusion, dilated cardio- myopathy, cor pulmonale, mitral valve disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy. The protocol has great poten- tial to influence treatment of patients with heart failure in resource-limited settings. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether the protocol can easily be taught and implemented by clinicians, and if ultrasound findings have a positive influence on treatment decisions without missing important findings that would be observed by a specialist echocardiogram.
