Anaesthetic risk factors: * Use of volatile anaesthetics within 0 to 2 hours * Nitrous oxide, and * Use of intra- and postoperative opioids. Surgical risk factors: * Duration of surgery (each 30-minute increase in duration increases PONV risk by 60%), and * Type of surgery (laparoscopy, ear-nose-throat, neurosurgery, breast, strabismus, laparotomy, plastic surgery). Strategies to prevent PONV Decrease baseline risk Calculated risk using the Apfel simplified risk score for adults or the POVOC score for children. * Avoid general anaesthesia and use loco-regional anaesthesia instead. If general anaesthesia is required, TIVA with propofol reduces the incidence of PONV by 30%, making this intervention as effective as an antiemetic drug. * Limiting the perioperative administration of opioids decreases not only the risk of PONV.
