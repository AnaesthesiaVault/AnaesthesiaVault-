Proposed Evaluation and Treatment Evaluate and treat common modifiable: ‘contibutors to delirium* Drugs Consider the etiologic role of newly iniiated drugs, increased doses, interactions, over the- counter drugs, and alcohol; consider especially the role of high-risk drugs: lower the dose, discontinue the drug, or substitute a less psychoactive medication Electrolyte disturbances Assess for and treat, especially dehydration, sodium imbalance, and thyroid abnormalities Lack of drugs Assess possible symptoms of withdrawal from longterm use of sedatives, including alcohol and sleeping pills; assess for and treat poorly controlled pain (lack of analgesia): use local mea- Sures and scheduled treatment regimens that minimize the use of opioids (avoid meperidine) Infection Evaluate and treat, especiall urinary tract, respiratory tract, and softtissue infections Reduced sensory input ‘Address issues involving vision (e.g., encourage use of eyeglasses) and hearing (e.g, encourage use of hearing aids or a portable amplifer) Intracranial disorders Consider such disorders (e.g. infection, hemorthage, stroke, or tumor) if there are new focal neurologic findings or a suggestive history or if diagnostic evaluation for causes outside the central nervous systen is unrevealing. Urinary and fecal disorders ‘Assess for and treat urinary retention (so-called cystocerebral syndrome) and fecal impaction Myocardial and pulmonary disorders Assess for and treat myocardial infarction, arthythmia, heart failure, hypotension, severe anemia, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypoxia, and hypercarbia Prevent or manage complications Urinary incontinence Implement a scheduled toileting program Immobility and falls Avoid physical restraints; mobilize the patient with assistance; use physical therapy Pressure ulcers Mobilize the patient; reposition an immobilized patient frequently and monitor pressure points Sleep disturbance Implement a nonpharmacologic sleep-hygiene program, including a nighttime sleep protocol; avoid sedatives; minimize unnecessary awakenings (c.g., for measuing vital signs) Feeding disorders Monitor dietary intake; provide feeding assistance if needed, aspiration precatttions, and supple- ‘mentation as necessary Maintain patient comfort and safety Behavioralinterventions Teach hospital staffde-escalation techniques for patients who have hyperactive o agitated deliriurm; encourage family visitation Pharmacologic interventions. Use low doses of high-potency antipsychotic agents only if necessary Restore function Hospital environment Reduce clutter and noise; provide adequate lighting; encourage familyto bring in familiar objects from home. Cognitive reconditioning Staff should reorient patient to time, place, and person at least three times daily Abiltyto perform activities of daily living. Use physical and occupational therapy; as delirium clears, match performance to ability Family education, support and partici- Provide education about delirium, it causes and reversibilty, the best ways to interact with pation affected patients, and the role of the family in restoring function Discharge planning and education Provide increased support for activities of daiy living as needed at discharge; teach family ‘members to follow mental status as a barometer of recovery * The first letters of these eight items form the mnemonic DELIRIUM.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
