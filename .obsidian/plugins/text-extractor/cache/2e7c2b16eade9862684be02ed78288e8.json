Paneth cells and intestinal mast cells release potent effectors to regulate local injury and systemic inflammation after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion. Most prominently, the Paneth cell-dependent pathway (blue) depends on release of interleukin (IL)-17 from Paneth cells localized at the base of small intestinal crypts. Mast cell responses (purple) use a number of preformed and de novo synthesized products such as proteases (tryptase, mast cell protease [MCP]-4), lipid mediators (leukotriens, pros- taglandins), and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-a, IL-6).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
