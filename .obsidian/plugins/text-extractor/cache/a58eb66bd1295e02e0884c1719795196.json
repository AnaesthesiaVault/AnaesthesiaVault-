Example of Applying the Simplified Stewart Approach An intubated and ventilated patient with known cirrhosis is transferred from the emergency room for a laparotomy. The patient has had saline resuscitation. Plasma chemistry: sodium, 133 mmol/L; chloride, 110 mmol/L; albumin, 22 g/L; and lactate, 5 mmol/L Arterial blood gas: pH, 7.20; Pco,, 40 mm Hg; bicarbonate, 15 mmol/L; standard base excess, -11.5 mmol/L. 1. The sodium chloride base-excess effect = 133 — 110 — 35 = —12 meq/L (Equation 1) 2. Lactate base-excess effect = 1 — 5 = -4 meq/L (Equation 2) 3. Albumin base-excess effect = 0.25 x (42 — 22) = +5.5 meq/L (Equation 3) 4. Given base excess is —11.5 meq/L, the other ions (Ol) base-excess effect = -1 meq/L (Equation 5) If we use a bicarbonate-based approach, this patient has an acidemia and decreased bicarbonate level suggesting a metabolic acidosis with inadequate respiratory compensation (expected Pco, approximately 30.5 mm Hg: 1.5 x bicarbonate + 8)'° and therefore a mixed disorder with increased lactate. The base excess alone tells us that there is a quantitatively important metabolic acidosis (expected Pco, approximately 29.5 mm Hg: 40 + base excess)'? and therefore a mixed disorder, with an elevated lactate. The simplified Stewart approach tells us this information, and also, quantitatively, that much of the change in base excess is secondary to a relative hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis partly offset by decreased albumin and aggravated by lactic acidosis. It also tells us that other ions do not currently play a major role. This finding is consistent with saline resuscitation in a patient with cirrhosis and an abdominal surgical problem. In addition to surgery and increased ventilation, a switch to lower chloride fluids such as Plasmalyte would be expected to widen the Na-Cl difference and decrease the acidosis. If Plasmalyte administration (Na 140 mmol/L and Cl 98 mmol/L) were to increase sodium by 1 meq/L and decrease chloride by 3 meq/L, the base excess would be expected to improve by 4 meq/L. Furthermore, because albumin is a weak acid, administering albumin will increase the total weak acid concentration and will increase the metabolic acidosis. This effect is in addition to adverse clinical chemistry effects of the crystalloid carrier for albumin that may increase the chloride concentration and that may sustain or worsen the Na-Cl base-excess effect by further decreasing the strong-ion difference. Finally from a Stewart perspective, sodium bicarbonate mav be seen as chloride-free sodium that will increase the Na-Cl difference.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
