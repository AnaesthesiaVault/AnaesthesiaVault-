Pachtman Shetty, MD, MSE; Seth Koenig, MD; Sara Tenenbaum, BS, RDMS, RDCS; Natalie Meirowitz, MD BACKGROUND: Transthoracic point-of-care ultrasonography of the lungs has become a standard technique in critical care medicine for the evaluation of patients with respiratory signs or symptoms but has not been well studied in pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To compare lung ultrasound patterns in third-trimester gravidas with and without preeclampsia and assess interobserver agreement between 3 obstetrical providers and a physician expert in critical care lung ultrasound. STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective observational study of 262 women with singleton pregnancies between 32 0/7 and 41 6/7 weeks’ gestation. Lung ultrasound examinations were performed and inter- preted by a team of obstetrical care providers and then interpreted by an expert in point-of-care lung ultrasound. The number of B-lines in each of the 4 lung ﬁelds, indicating the accumulation of ﬂuid in the interstitial space and the alveoli, was evaluated. The primary outcome was a positive study for pulmonary interstitial edema, deﬁned as an ultrasound study with 3 or more B-lines in 2 or more bilateral lung ﬁelds. The secondary outcome was a lung ultrasound study with 1 or 2 B-lines in 1 or more lung ﬁelds or 3 B-lines in 1 lung ﬁeld. Interobserver agreement in lung ultrasound interpretation between obstetrical care providers and an expert in critical care point-of-care ultrasonography of the lung was assessed. RESULTS: Among healthy gravidas, no subject had a lung ultrasound examination positive for pulmonary interstitial edema. Notably, 2 patients with preeclampsia had positive lung ultrasound studies, and both had respiratory symptoms or signs of pulmonary edema. One or 2 B-lines or 3 B- lines in 1 lung ﬁeld were identiﬁed in 11.4% of healthy gravidas and 18.6% of patients with preeclampsia. There was no difference in lung ultrasound patterns between healthy gravidas and those with preeclampsia. The obstetrical care providers and the lung ultrasound expert had a high pro- portion of agreement regarding the interpretation of negative lung ultra- sound examinations. The 2 patients with clinical signs of pulmonary edema were judged to have positive studies by both the obstetrical team and the expert; however, the obstetrical team classiﬁed more studies as positive. CONCLUSION: Lung ultrasound patterns in women with preeclampsia without respiratory symptoms or clinical signs of pulmonary edema are similar to the lung ultrasound patterns of healthy gravidas. Point-of-care lung ultrasound can be used to evaluate third-trimester gravidas with preeclampsia and respiratory complaints or signs concerning for pulmo- nary edema. Formal training is important before the widespread adoption of point-of-care lung ultrasound by obstetrical healthcare providers. Key words: lung ultrasound, POCUS, thoracic point-of-care ultrasound, preeclampsia, pregnancy, pulmonary edema Introduction Transthoracic point-of-care ultrasonog- raphy (POCUS) of the lungs has become a standard technique in critical care and emergency medicine as an adjunct to the physical examination 1e3 but has not been thoroughly studied in pregnant women. 4 Lung ultrasound (US) can rapidly and accurately diagnose pulmo- nary pathology at the bedside and allows for immediate correlation of clinical status with imaging ﬁndings, facilitating prompt therapeutic management. 5,6 In addition, lung US is dynamic and can be repeated throughout the clinical course for monitoring effects of therapy or disease progression without concern for exposure to ionizing radiation.7e10 This technique has been used to diagnose pulmonary edema with up to 93% sensitivity and 98% speciﬁcity in nonpregnant adults 11e13 and is the ﬁrst- line approach in critical care settings because it is superior to chest x-ray for this purpose. 14 Pulmonary edema is a feature of preeclampsia which is associ- ated with signiﬁcant maternal morbidity15,16 and complicates an esti- mated 0.08% to 0.5% of pregnan- cies.15,17 Pulmonary edema was observed in 9.5% of 63 women with preeclampsia with severe features in a recent prospective study.18 The diagnostic capability of lung US is based on imaging artifacts originating from the pleural line. These artifacts, termed A-lines and B-lines, result from ultrasound imaging of the lung pleura sliding along the lung parenchyma with inspiration and expiration and are used to differentiate between normally aerated tissue and congested pulmonary tissue with increased extravascular water. A-lines are horizontal, echogenic lines that are a result of reverberation artifact between the ultrasound beam and the pleural line and indicate normal lung aeration when lung sliding is present (Figure 1).19,20 B-lines are hyperechoic vertical “laser-like” appearing lines that begin at the pleural line and extend the depth of the ultrasound ﬁeld, obscuring A-lines as they move with the respiratory cycle (Figure 2).12,21,22 B-lines are caused by the thickening of the interlobular septa as ﬂuid accumulates in the inter- stitial space and alveoli. Multiple bilat- eral B-lines (B-pattern) indicates edema.14 Some studies suggest that the number of B-lines across imaging ﬁelds is semiquantitative and correlates with the severity of interstitial edema.23,24 Multiple B-lines in a lung ﬁeld, termed B-pattern on lung US, are considered a sonographic sign of extra- vascular lung water but do not imply a speciﬁc etiology of pulmonary edema. This pattern may evolve not only as a Cite this article as: Pachtman Shetty SL, Koenig S, Tenenbaum S, et al.

In pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, additional factors pro- mote the formation of pulmonary edema. These include reduced plasma oncotic pressure, endothelial cell dysfunction, acute severe hypertension, and elevated pulmonary vascular hy- drostatic pressures27 and possibly abnormal diastolic left ventricular func- tion.28 Additional risk factors for pul- monary edema during pregnancy and the puerperium include iatrogenic ﬂuid overload and exposure to medications such as magnesium sulfate. 15 In several small studies, pregnancy- related pulmonary changes have been investigated using lung US. In 1 pro- spective observational study of healthy women in late pregnancy, 75% of women had lung US patterns similar to the physiological pattern seen in nonpregnant adults. In this study, the remaining 25% of healthy pregnant women showed 1 to 2 B-lines in at least 3 lung regions. 29 In another study of lung US patterns in women with preeclampsia with severe features, 25% had B-patterns suggestive of interstitial edema, some- times in the absence of symptoms, and a substantially greater number of B-lines in lung ﬁelds than healthy pregnant women. 30 The authors attributed this ﬁnding to the ultrasound’s ability to detect interstitial edema early, before the onset of clinical signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema. Another study eval- uating a small cohort of healthy women during uncomplicated labor reported at least 1 lung region with 3 or more B-lines in 67% of patients. 31 Other studies have also suggested that lung US patterns become abnormal before clinical signs develop or pulmonary disease is detected with physical examination,28 and an in- crease in the frequency of B-lines was observed in a population of women with preeclampsia and was associated with worsening clinical status.30,32 These studies suggest that lung US has the po- tential to guide ﬂuid management in patients with preeclampsia and to iden- tify those at risk for pulmonary edema before clinical deterioration.28 The main objective of this study was to compare lung US patterns in third- trimester gravidas with and without preeclampsia. The primary outcome was a positive ultrasound study for pulmo- nary interstitial edema, deﬁned as 3 or more B-lines in bilateral lung ﬁelds (B- pattern). The secondary outcome was a study with 1 or 2 B-lines in 1 or more lung ﬁelds (1e2 B-lines) or 3 B-lines in 1 ﬁeld (3 B-lines). We hypothesized that neither healthy pregnant women nor women with preeclampsia would have a positive study for pulmonary interstitial edema in the absence of respiratory symptoms, but that the secondary outcome lung patterns would be more frequent in women with preeclampsia, regardless of symptoms. The second objective was to assess interobserver agreement between 3 obstetrical pro- viders and a critical care physician with expertise in point-of-care lung US. We hypothesized that interpretations of lung US studies between obstetrical providers and the physician expert would reach a strong level of agreement. Materials and Methods A prospective observational study was conducted from August 2016 to May 2018 at Long Island Jewish Medical Center and North Shore University Hospital, both academic tertiary-care hospitals in New York. Women were considered eligible for inclusion if they were 18 years of age or older with singleton pregnancies between 32 0/7 and 41 6/7 weeks’ gestational age. Women were not considered eligible if they were unable to provide informed consent, were in active labor, had been treated for acute cardiac or pulmonary disease (including severe asthma) in pregnancy, had known interstitial lung disease, or were treated with magnesium sulfate for an indication other than seizure prophylaxis during the current hospital stay. Women with a diagnosis of pre- eclampsia, with or without severe fea- tures, were enrolled on labor and delivery, antepartum, or the obstetrical triage unit. Diagnoses were based on the 2013 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force for Hy- pertension in Pregnancy criteria (systolic blood pressure of \u0001140 mm Hg or dia- stolic blood pressure of \u000190 mm Hg on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart and AJOG MFM at a Glance Why was this study conducted? This study was conducted to compare lung ultrasound patterns in third-trimester gravidas with and without preeclampsia and assess interobserver agreement be- tween obstetrical providers and an expert in point-of-care lung ultrasound. Key ﬁndings Lung ultrasound patterns in pregnancy are similar to the nonpregnant popula- tion. This work demonstrates that lung ultrasound patterns in gravidas with preeclampsia without respiratory symptoms or clinical signs of pulmonary edema are similar to patterns of healthy gravidas. What does this add to what is known? The greatest interobserver agreement was seen among patients with a negative lung ultrasound study. Point-of-care lung ultrasound can be used to evaluate third-trimester women with preeclampsia and respiratory signs or symptoms concerning for pulmonary edema. Formal training of obstetrical providers is recommended before widespread adoption of point-of-care lung ultrasound by obstetrical providers.

Healthy, normotensive gestational-age-matched controls were approached and enrolled on labor and delivery, antepartum, or obstetrical triage units or at the on-site hospital prenatal clinic. A written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Approval was ob- tained from the Northwell Health Sys- tem Institutional Review Board (# HS16- 0447). Demographic and clinical character- istics including age, ethnicity, gestational age, medical and obstetrical history, vital signs, oxygen saturation, body mass in- dex (BMI), and administration of med- ications were collected from participants’ charts. Blood pressures were taken using automated devices (Corometrics 250cx Series maternal/ fetal monitor, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) according to the unit guidelines. Arterial oxygen saturation was measured noninvasively by external pulse oximetry monitor (Corometrics 250cx Series maternal/fetal monitor, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL). Laboratory data including hemoglobin, platelet count, serum creatinine and albumin, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine amino- transferase (ALT), uric acid, and urine protein assessment (when available) were collected from participants with preeclampsia. Laboratory data were not collected for the control group, because these studies are not routinely ordered for healthy gravidas in our institutions. Fluid intake and output were not recorded because these data were not always reliably available in control pa- tients. In our hospitals, women with preeclampsia who are treated with magnesium sulfate receive a 4 g bolus in 50 mL of ﬂuid over 20 minutes and then receive magnesium and lactated ringers for a total of 100 mL per hour.

Original Research MARCH 2021 AJOG MFM 3 women without preeclampsia receive a total of 125 mL of lactated ringers per hour during induction or while in labor. Lung US examinations were per- formed with the subject in a semi- recumbent position using a Sonosite M-Turbo ultrasound machine (FUJI- FILM Sonosite, Inc, Bothell, WA) with a C60e 2 to 5 MHz 30 cm curvilinear transducer. Subjects were imaged at the time of enrollment, and cases with a diagnosis of preeclampsia with severe features were imaged after completion of magnesium sulfate bolus when possible. Subjects were assigned to a study group (preeclampsia, preeclampsia with severe features, or control) based on the diag- nosis at the time of enrollment. Examinations were performed at bedside by 3 investigators with informal on-site training in point-of-care lung US: a maternal-fetal medicine attending physician, a maternal-fetal medicine fellow physician, and a registered diag- nostic medical sonographer (obstetrical team). The lungs were imaged by dividing each hemithorax into anterior and pos- terior zones. The anterior zones were imaged by placing the probe longitudi- nally at the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line. The posterior zones were imaged with the probe in the pos- terior axillary line at the level of the dia- phragm. 20 A total of 4 lung ﬁelds (right anterior, right posterior, left anterior, and left posterior) were imaged for each subject. Our protocol, based on a basic 8- region technique previously described by Volpicelli et al, 13 was revised to image 4 regions because it utilizes a curvilinear transducer with a larger footprint than traditional linear probes, allowing for only 4 ﬁelds with upward displacement of the diaphragm and limited acoustic windows in third-trimester pregnant pa- tients. The standard curvilinear probe with frequency range used on most labor and delivery units was chosen because it is widely available in this clinical setting. Images were converted to Joint Photo- graphic Experts Group (.jpg) and MPEG- 4 Part 14 (.mp4) formats and stored on a secure server. A member of the obstetrical team (either the maternal-fetal medicine attending or fellow physician) interpreted the images. A fourth investigator, a pul- monary and critical care attending physician expert with formal fellowship training in point-of-care lung US who was blinded to the subject’sclinical status, then reviewed and interpreted stored cine clips. The number of B-lines interpreted by the obstetrical team and the lung US expert in each of the 4 lung ﬁelds was recorded. A positive study for pulmonary edema was deﬁned as a B-pattern in bilateral lung ﬁelds. The presence of A- lines and absence of B-lines (A-line dominant pattern) deﬁned a negative study. Participants were assigned a unique study ID, and data including image interpretation results were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture secure data capture tool hosted at Northwell Health. 34,35 Power analysis determined that 89 cases and 178 controls would be needed for this study to have a power of 80% for a targeted detection rate of 1 to 2 B-lines in 1 to 2 lung ﬁelds in subjects with preeclampsia at a 0.05 level of signiﬁ- cance with a case: control ratio of 2:1. This calculation was based on a previous study where 25% of healthy pregnant women had 1 to 2 B-lines in at least 3 lung regions.29 Categorical variables were compared using chi-squared (c 2) independence test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. Yate’s correction for continuity was used with the c 2 statistic to correct for small sample size when necessary. The Mann- Whitney U test was used to compare the variable means of 2 groups. The analysis of variance test was used to compare the means of the variables across the cate- gories of the index variables. Tukey’s range test was used to ﬁnd the means that were different from each other. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using a kappa (k) statistic. Relationships between independent continuous vari- ables and lung US categorical outcomes were examined using logistic regression to determine the relative risk (RR) of the presence of B-lines in different groups of patients. Continuous data were pre- sented as the mean\u0003standard deviation. Categorical data were presented as fre- quencies by category. P<.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant for all tests. Statistical analyses were performed using Stat/MP 13.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX). Results During the study period, 262 women were enrolled on a voluntary basis. Lung POCUS examinations were performed on 176 healthy controls and 86 gravidas with a diagnosis of preeclampsia: 38 without severe features and 48 with se- vere features (Figure 3). All lung US examinations were performed without difﬁculty in under 5 minutes, and no subject withdrew from the study. All patients who met the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia with severe features were treated with magnesium sulfate by their primary attending obstetrician. Demographic and clinical characteris- tics of the study population are pre- sented in Table 1. Subjects with preeclampsia were more frequently nulliparous (P¼.01) and had lower ox- ygen saturation (P¼.036) than healthy gravidas. Patients with preeclampsia with severe features had a different ethnic pattern (P¼.027). Based on a review of records, no subject admitted to smoking tobacco or marijuana dur- ing pregnancy. Laboratory characteris- tics of subjects with preeclampsia are presented in Table 2. Patients with preeclampsia with severe features had higher maximum diastolic (P¼.008) and systolic blood pressure readings (P<.001), lower platelet counts (P¼.042), higher serum ALT values (P¼.036), and lower serum albumin levels (P¼.010) than women with pre- eclampsia without severe features. Lung US patterns of the study popu- lation are presented in Table 3. In the group of healthy gravidas, the lung US expert did not interpret any subject’s lung US examination as positive for pulmonary interstitial edema, whereas 2 patients with preeclampsia were judged to have positive studies. Both of these subjects had severe hypertension at the time of presentation and had respiratory symptoms or signs suggestive of pul- monary edema. Notably, 1 subject developed respiratory complaints, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen satu- ration after initiation of magnesium Original Research 4 AJOG MFM MARCH 2021 sulfate, was delivered via cesarean de- livery, and was treated with furosemide with resolution of symptoms. The sec- ond subject delivered via cesarean de- livery shortly after presentation with severe hypertension, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation. Both the obstetrical team and the lung US expert interpreted these 2 studies as positive. None of the patients had a chest x-ray or computed tomography of the chest because of the need for urgent delivery. Both subjects had marked proteinuria (urine protein, creatinine 8.23 and 8.5, respectively). The secondary outcome, ultrasound patterns with 1 to 2 B-lines in 1 or more lung ﬁelds or 3 B-lines in 1 lung ﬁeld, was identiﬁed in 11.4% of healthy grav- idas and 18.6% of patients with pre- eclampsia. There was no signiﬁcant difference in these lung US examination patterns between healthy gravidas and those with preeclampsia as interpreted by the lung US expert (P¼.11). Patients with preeclampsia did not have 1 to 2 B- lines in 1 or more ﬁelds more frequently than healthy gravidas (P¼.07). In a planned analysis, univariate logistic regression revealed that the presence of 1 to 2 B-lines on examination is associated with maximum systolic blood pressure (RR, 1.56; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.05e2.3; P¼.024) and maximum dia- stolic blood pressure (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13e1.37; P<.0001) as continuous variables and is inversely associated with oxygen saturation (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55e0.93; P¼.013) as a continuous variable. Lung US patterns of subjects with preeclampsia vs preeclampsia with se- vere features are presented in Table 4. These results support a difference in lung US patterns between preeclamptic grav- idas without severe features and those with severe features (P¼.01) as inter- preted by the lung US expert; however, this difference seems to be caused by the difference in 1 to 2 B-lines in 1 lung ﬁeld between groups (P¼.048). There was no difference in the incidence of 1 to 2 B- lines in 1 or more ﬁelds between subjects with preeclampsia who were or were not treated with antihypertensive agents in the 2 hours before the ultrasound examination (P¼1.0 and P¼.52, respec- tively). In patients with preeclampsia, serum albumin is inversely associated with the presence of B-lines in 1 or more lung ﬁelds (RR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02e0.62; P¼.013). There was no cor- relation of uric acid, platelet count, or clinical characteristics including ethnicity or maternal BMI with the absence or presence of any number of B- lines on ultrasound examination. In women with preeclampsia with severe features, univariate logistic regression revealed that the presence of 1 to 2 B- lines on examination was inversely associated with maximum diastolic blood pressure (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83e0.98; P¼.026). The obstetrical team and the lung US expert interpreted the lung US examina- tions of all patients with fair agreement based on the k correlation coefﬁcient (k¼0.30). The cross-classiﬁcation of ul- trasound interpretations and the pro- portions of agreement between the obstetrical team and the lung US expert is presented in Table 5. There were a total of 60 discrepant examination in- terpretations, corresponding to a rate of 22.9%. Agreement was greatest between the obstetrical team and the lung US expert when lung US studies were nega- tive (proportion of agreement, 0.81) (Table 5). The 2 patients with respiratory signs or symptoms were judged to have a positive study by both the obstetrical team and the lung expert, however, the obstetrical team interpreted a greater number of studies as positive. The observer teams disagreed most on the presence of 1 to 2 B-lines. Discussion Consistent with our hypothesis, a posi- tive study for pulmonary interstitial edema was not observed in women with preeclampsia in the absence of respira- tory symptoms or clinical signs of pul- monary edema. This ﬁnding is in agreement with previously reported ﬁndings that third-trimester healthy gravidas have normal lung US pat- terns.29 We expected to ﬁnd some dif- ferences in the lung patterns between healthy gravidas and those with pre- eclampsia; however, our results did not show an increased frequency of any number of B-lines in women with FIGURE 3 Flow diagram Study population ﬂow diagram.

Original Research 6 AJOG MFM MARCH 2021 preeclampsia compared with healthy gravidas. This is in contrast with previ- ous studies reporting a higher incidence of B-line dominant lung patterns in women with preeclampsia.18,29 This may be caused by differences in disease severity among the study populations or interpretation of images. As expected, platelet counts, ALT, and serum albumin differed signiﬁcantly between patients with preeclampsia without severe features and those with severe features (P¼.042, .036, and .010, respectively). Patients with preeclampsia with severe features had signiﬁcantly lower levels of serum albumin, which decreases the threshold for developing pulmonary edema secondary to the decrease in plasma oncotic pressure. Women with preeclampsia with severe features had B-lines more frequently than women without severe features; this may be indicative of increased pulmo- nary congestion in these patients or an early sign of interstitial edema that may precede clinical signs of pulmonary edema. Analysis did reveal that B-lines were visualized more frequently in pregnant women with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, consistent with the theory that cardiovascular changes in pregnancy and preeclampsia could change lung US patterns and that there is increased pulmonary congestion in hypertensive patients. In addition, B- lines were also visualized more frequently in women with decreased oxygen saturation, which may suggest the ability of lung US to detect extra- vascular lung water before the develop- ment of overt clinical pulmonary edema. An expert in POCUS reviewed the cine clips in this study, and his interpretations were compared with the obstetrical team’s interpretations to provide interobserver TABLE 2 Laboratory characteristics of subjects with preeclampsia without severe features vs with severe features Characteristic Preeclampsia without severe features (n¼38) Preeclampsia with severe features (n¼48) P value Hemoglobin (g/dL) 11.9 (1.31) 11.8 (1.20) .748 Platelets (K/uL) 222.6 (52.2) 196.6 (60.8) .042a Serum creatinine (mg/dL) 0.66\u00030.19 0.70\u00030.19 .289 AST (U/L) 24.8\u00039.2 37.9\u000339.7 .053 ALT (U/L) 19.8\u00038.47 39.8\u000356.4 .036 a Serum albumin (g/dL) 3.41 (0.34) 3.21 (0.34) .010 a Uric acid (mg/dL) 5.48 (1.33) 5.46 (1.26) .921 Urine P/C (n¼35 without severe features, n¼43 with severe features) 1.24\u00031.88 2.03\u00033.91 .281 Urine protein (mg/24 h) (n¼14 without severe features, n¼10 with severe features) 1443.5\u00032402.8 634.9\u0003254.1 .321 Data are expressed as number (percentage) and mean\u0003standard deviation unless indicated otherwise.

Over the entire popula- tion of patients, there was a fair level of agreement between the obstetrical team and the lung US expert. Notably, no pa- tient with a positive lung US examination was missed by the obstetrical team. In addition, the 2 observer teams had the best agreement in interpretation of negative studies, pointing to the obstet- rical providers’ ability to quickly rule out pulmonary edema as the cause of respi- ratory complaints or signs of distress in pregnant women using lung US. The expert and the obstetrical team did have different US interpretations of lung ﬁndings across all patients. We suggest several possible explanations for this difference. In this study design, the obstetrical team acquiring the images was able to analyze them in real time, whereas the lung US expert reviewed these images retrospectively on 3 to 6 second video clips, potentially impacting interpretation. In addition, the lung US expert was blinded to clinical status, whereas the obstetrical team was not. The obstetrical team’s possible bias may explain their more frequent observation of 1 to 2 B-lines. The lung US expert’s interpretation was potentially biased because his interpretation was limited to those cine clips recorded by the obstet- rical team. The ﬂuctuation of B-lines during the examination may also lead to further discrepancy.36e38 Because of these observed differences in interpre- tation, obstetrical providers in lung US should undergo formal training. Chart recording of intake and output was not documented reliably in all pa- tient groups, so ﬂuid balance, which may impact pulmonary interstitial edema, could not be accounted for. A focal B- line pattern, particularly in posterior lung ﬁelds at the lung bases, may be caused by atelectasis rather than pul- monary interstitial edema.14 Hospital- ized obstetrical patients, including many in this study, are in the supine position, which may lead to B-lines in posterior lung ﬁelds.

Original Research 8 AJOG MFM MARCH 2021 Conclusion Point-of-care lung US may be used to evaluate third-trimester women with preeclampsia and signs or symptoms of respiratory compromise. This study is the largest to compare lung US patterns in pregnant patients with and without a diagnosis of preeclampsia and provides information that may be useful when caring for women with preeclampsia. Third-trimester gravidas without signs or symptoms of pulmonary edema did not have abnormal lung US examina- tions in this study, but gravidas with preeclampsia with severe features had B- lines more frequently than those without severe features. Even given the large size of this study, the limited power pre- vented the evaluation of the utility of transthoracic POCUS as a tool to docu- ment the presence of interstitial pulmo- nary edema in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia. Additional research to study the use of lung US for the man- agement of preeclampsia is warranted. Future studies evaluating the impact of ﬂuid balance on lung US patterns may support its use in guiding ﬂuid man- agement in women with preeclampsia. Longitudinal studies evaluating changes in lung US patterns throughout the course of preeclampsia may be helpful in determining whether the number of B- lines can be interpreted as an early sign of pulmonary interstitial edema that precedes the clinical signs of pulmonary edema. Interobserver agreement of POCUS of the lung interpretation was fair across all patients; however, no pa- tient with a positive study was missed by the obstetrician team and the best agreement was in the interpretation of negative studies. Formal training of obstetrical providers and assessment of intraobserver differences in ultrasound ﬁndings are recommended before the widespread adoption of point-of-care lung US by obstetrical care providers. n References 1.
