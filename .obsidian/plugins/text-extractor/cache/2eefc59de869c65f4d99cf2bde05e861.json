CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE / PRESSURE SUPPORT VENTILATION (CPAP/PSV) (NOTE DRAGER MACHINES LABEL THIS SPONTANEOUS CPAP SPN-CPAP) P : Man, insp. / fiold - Spontanaous breathing Spontaneous braathing Compared to the atmospheric pressure, the airway pressure is increased during the complete breathing cycle. The effect of the continuous pressure is to splint open the alveoli and prevents atelectasis. During a pressure supported breath, the ventilator provides a set pressure levet on top of the CPAP level during the inspiratory phase of the patientâ€™s breath. If the patient becomes apnoeic, a set backup minimum rate and inspiratory pressure kicks in. As soon as the patient is able to breathe spontaneously again, the machine reverts to CPAP PSV.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
