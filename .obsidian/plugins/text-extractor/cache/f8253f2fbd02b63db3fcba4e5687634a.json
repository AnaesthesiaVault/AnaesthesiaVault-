They failed to show any benefit in any subgroups - namely in surgical patients (where the liberal arm had an increased in length of stay in ICU), in septic patients, or cardiac surgical patients {Lacroix 2015). Clearly, the decision on when to act on a transfusion trigger must also consider other factors such as acute blood loss, acute drop in Hb, underlying disease process. This is nicely set out in the paediatric literature, see Figure 3. Recommendations are emerging to transfuse PICU patients if their Hb <5g/dL or these is evidence of haemorrhagic shock. Red cell transfusion is unnecessary in stable PICU patients when Hb >7g/dL, this excludes patients with univentricular pathology, as the optimum transfusion threshold in this subgroup remains to be determined {Lacroix 2015).
