STRESS ULCER PROPHYLAXIS 1.We recommend that stress ulcer prophylaxis be given to patients with sepsis or septic shock who have risk factors for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). 2.We suggest using either proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists when stress ulcer prophylaxis is indicated (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). 3.We recommend against stress ulcer prophylaxis in patients without risk factors for GI bleeding (BPS). T.NUTRITION 1.We recommend against the administration of early parenteral nutrition alone or parenteral nutrition in combination with enteral feedings (but rather initiate early enteral nutrition) in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock who can be fed enterally (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 2.We recommend against the administration of parenteral nutrition alone or in combination with enteral feeds (but rather to initiate IV glucose and advance enteral feeds as tolerated) over the first 7 days in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock for ‘whom early enteral feeding is not feasible (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 3.We suggest the early initiation of enteral feeding rather than a complete fast or only IV glucose in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock who can be fed enterally (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). 4.We suggest either early trophic/hypocaloric or early full enteral feeding in critically il patients with sepsis or septic shock; if trophic/hypocaloric feeding is the initial strategy, then feeds should be advanced according to patient tolerance (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 5. We recommend against the use of omega-3 fatty acids as an immune supplement in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). 6. We suggest against routinely monitoring gastric residual volumes in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). However, we suggest measurement of gastric residuals in patients with feeding intolerance or who are considered to be at high risk of aspiration (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Remarks: This recommendation refers to nonsurgical critically il patients with sepsis or septic shock. 7. We suggest the use of prokinetic agents in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock and feeding intolerance (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). 8. We suggest placement of post-pyloric feeding tubes in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock with feeding intolerance or who are considered to be at high risk of aspiration (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). 9. We recommend against the use of IV selenium to treat sepsis and septic shock (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 10.We suggest against the use of arginine to treat sepsis and septic shock (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). 11.We recommend against the use of glutamine to treat sepsis and septic shock (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 12, We make no recommendation about the use of carnitine for sepsis and septic shock. U. SETTING GOALS OF CARE 1.We recommend that goals of care and prognosis be discussed with patients and families (BPS). 2. We recommend that goals of care be incorporated into treatment and end-of-life care planning, utilizing palliative care principles ‘where appropriate (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 3. We suggest that goals of care be addressed as early as feasible, but no later than within 72 hours of ICU admission (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
