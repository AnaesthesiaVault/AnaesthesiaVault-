{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20231114202528.png","text":"Vomiting has two phases: ‘pre-ejection’ and ‘ejection’. In the pre-ejection phase, the sympathetic nervous system causes the unpleasant symptoms of tachycardia, tachypnoea and sweating, whilst the parasympathetic system causes salivation, upper and lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation and retrograde contraction. This prepares the body for the ejection phase. In older children, the pre-ejection phase is experienced as nausea. The ejection phase starts with cessation of respiration in midinspiration; the hyoid and larynx elevate to open the crico-oesophageal sphincter, the glottis closes, the soft palate elevates to close off the nasopharynx, and contraction of the diaphragm occurs to increase intra-abdominal pressure. Finally, the gastro-oesophageal sphincter opens and the gastric contents are ejected.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
