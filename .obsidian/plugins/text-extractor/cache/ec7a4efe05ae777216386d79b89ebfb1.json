Focus on a laboratory-based, viscoelastic testing paradigm, with opportunities for intervention based on clinical decision-making. Our protocol advocates antifibrinolytic therapy, correction of acidosis, and correction of acute hypocalcaemia. Inside the redbox, our balanced ratio recommendations are presented if the patient has been transfused four units of blood and intraoperative haemorrhage is ongoing. Consideration is given to low-dose factor concentrate usage (PCCs, FVIIa) if bleeding is refractory to balanced resuscitation and algorithmic options. ‘Figure modified from a draft version of our local massive transfusion protocol.
