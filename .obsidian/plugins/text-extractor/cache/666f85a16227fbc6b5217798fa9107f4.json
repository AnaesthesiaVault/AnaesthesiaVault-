This is again a mode of ventilation which can be of benefit only if there are spontaneous breathing efforts by the patient. During PSV, once a breath is initiated by the patient, the ventilator pressurises the airway to a given inspiratory support pressure (PS). Each PSV assisted breath is terminated according to a pre-set decrease in flow. A potential benefit of this mode of ventilation is that it can be used with LMAs due to its ability to set pressure support levels below the leak seal pressure of the LMA.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
