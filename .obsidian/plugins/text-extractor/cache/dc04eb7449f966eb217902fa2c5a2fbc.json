Thought to be caused by excessive flexion of the neck, obstructing the internal jugular vein which in turn obstructs the lingual and pharyngeal veins. o Mediastinal compression. Possible in patients with chest wall abnormalities. o Visceral ischaemia. Hepatic ischaemia and pancreatitis have been described. o Avascular necrosis of femoral head. Described in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip in the prone position subjected to a hypotensive anaesthetic technique o Peripheral vessel occlusion o Limb compartment syndromes and rhabdomyolysis Embolic complications * Venous gas embolism. Efforts to minimise abdominal compression and thus IVC pressure in the prone position can result in an increased negative pressure gradient between the right atrium and veins at the operative site. It is important to maintain intravascular volume to minimise the risk. * Non-gaseous embolism. A few reports exist of fat, cement and bone fragment emboli.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
