' Timing of surgery refers to emergency surgery (eg, severe trauma, ruptured aortic aneurysm), urgent surgery (eg, hip fracture, bowel obstruction), semiurgent surgery (eg, cancer with potential to metastasize), or elective surgery (eg, knee arthro- plasty). © If physical examination suggests there is an unknown severe obstructive intracardiac abnormality (eg, severe aortic stenosis, severe mitral stenosis, or severe hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) or severe PHTN, then obtain an echocardiogram before surgery to inform the anesthesiologist, surgeon, and medical team of the type and degree of disease. If the history suggests the patient has an unstable cardiac condition (eg, unstable angina) then discussion with the patient and surgical/medical team is required to decide whether to delay, cancel, or proceed with surgery. * RCRI score (each worth 1 point): history of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, preoperative insulin use, preoperative creatinine > 177 pmol/L, and high-risk surgery (ie, intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular surgery). ** Shared-care management refers to a multidisciplinary approach to inpatient postoperative care; this includes the surgeon and a medical specialist (eg, internist, cardiologist, gerontologist), who will help with perioperative monitoring and management of cardiovascular complications.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
