There is considerable interest in how echocardiography could be used to beneﬁt patients in other areas of anaesthesia and peri-operative practice. The ﬁrst part of review examines the impact and utility of echocardiography, while this second part is concerned with the matter of training and accreditation. There are a number of existing clinical protocols for the use of transthoracic echocardiography with a focused approach. Some of these, such as Focused Intensive Care Echocardiography in the UK, have been developed into structured accreditation processes with embedded supervision. Learning opportunities are now emerging for anaesthetists who wish to acquire echocar- diography skills – these encompass clinical, simulation and online resources. Whilst the roll-out of echocardiography for more widespread use in peri-operative management is a long-term project, it is now an appropriate time to con- sider how this may be achieved. ................................................................................................................................................................. Correspondence to: S. N. Fletcher Email: snick@doctors.org.uk Accepted: 28 March 2014 Introduction The migration and translation of echocardiography for broader application in new areas of clinical practice is a progressive theme in the new millennium. Echocar- diography training and accreditation is embedded in cardiology training and practice, and is now well established in cardiac anaesthesia [1–5]. Similarly, the evolution and integration of echocardiography within critical care is in progress [6–9]. Patient and physician beneﬁt are the key drivers of this process, but little could have been achieved without a systematic approach to training and accreditation. There is a continuing service demand for skilled echocardiogra- phers, both physician and sonographer, in various aspects of non-cardiac anaesthesia practice. In this review, we discuss existing international approaches to echocardiography training and accreditation in anaes- thesia and critical care. We investigate strategies by which anaesthetists, with particular reference to the UK, can access training and develop appropriate echo- cardiography skills. The main focus is on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), although transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) is also discussed. The impact and utility of echocardiography within anaesthesia practice has been reviewed elsewhere in this journal [10]. Transthoracic echocardiography Echocardiography consists of two separate processes: ﬁrstly, the technical operation of the ultrasound © 2014 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland 919 Anaesthesia 2014, 69, 919–927 doi:10.1111/anae.12709 platform and the physical scanning technique to identify and record optimal images of the appropri- ate views; and secondly, the interpretation of the recorded images to identify pathology, create an accurate report and determine appropriate manage- ment. Findings should be consistent and reproducible between different operators [11]. This holds true whether the examination is performed in cardiology outpatients or the accident and emergency depart- ment. Different service conﬁgurations are possible: a physician may perform and interpret the examina- tion; or a sonographer may perform the examination, which is subsequently interpreted by a physician. As focused point-of-care protocols have been developed, the sonographer models of echocardiography have not generally been applied. Focused protocols are usually performed in an acute point-of-care situation by a non-cardiologist physician, with a view to tak- ing immediate action in the event of a signiﬁcant pathological ﬁnding. Referral for more expert scan- ning or interpretation, should difﬁculty or uncer- tainty arise, is an essential operating principle for all these focused scans. There are a number of focused TTE protocols around the world, with different levels of structure, complexity and supervision; most also include a limited lung ultrasound examination. Some of these allow simultaneous accreditation of practitio- ners, whereas others are stand-alone clinical protocols [9, 12–19] (Table 1). A simple focused protocol suit- able for anaesthetists and based on existing protocols is suggested (Table 2). Echocardiography is a broad ﬁeld of endeavour, adapted by differing specialties for their own needs. For current purposes, it can be roughly divided into advanced and basic modes, the focused protocols all belonging to the basic category. The notion of basic TTE essentially includes 2D and some M-mode imaging, with very limited anatomical or functional quantiﬁcation data. Advanced echocardiography skills include quanti- tative evaluation, such as colour and spectral Doppler modes, allied to a much greater appreciation of patho- logical conditions. Advanced skills would actually be core skills in the context of sonographer or cardiology training schemes. Currently, sonographer and cardiol- ogy practice does not include basic or focused TTE skills. These groups will generally achieve what weTable1Anoverviewofthecommonlyavailableintroductoryfocusedechocardiographytrainingmodules.Name,yearEchocardiographyviewsPotentialvalueChamberquantiﬁcationDopplerassessmentNumberofscansrequiredforcertiﬁcationFEEL,2009PLAX,PSAX,A4C,S4CPeri-resuscitation;todiagnosepoorLVfunctionpericardialeffusion,PE,hypovolaemiaNo50supervisedscansBasicFATE,1989PLAX,PSAX,A4C,S4C,pleuraPost-cardiacsurgery,PE,LVsegments,AVAoNoNotapplicableAdvancedFATEPLAX,PSAX,SIVC,A4C,A2C,A5CSameasforbasicFATEYes;advancedassessmentofcardiacoutput,pressureestimationandLVdiastolicfunctionNotapplicableFICE,2012PLAX,PSAX,A4C,S4C,SIVC,pleuraPoorLV/RVfunction,pericardial/pleuraleffusionNo50supervisedscansHART.scan,2008PLAX,PSAX,A4C,A5C,A2C,A3C,RVinﬂow,S4C,SIVCHaemodynamicstateandvalvularassessmentYes30scansBasicPTE,201311TOEviewsNon-diagnosticintra-operativeuseformonitoringexceptemergenciesNo150supervisedscansFEEL,focusedechocardiographyinemergencylifesupport;FATE,focusedassessedtransthoracicechocardiography;FICE,focusedintensivecareechocardiography;HART,haemodynamicecho-cardiographyassessmentinrealtime;PTE,peri-operativetransoesophagealechocardiography;PLAX,parasternallongaxis;PSAX,parasternalshortaxis;A4C,apicalfour-chamber;S4C,subcostalfour-chamber;SIVC,subcostalinferiorvenacavaviews;A2C,apicaltwo-chamber;A5C,apicalﬁve-chamber;A3C,apicalthree-chamber;RV,rightventricle;TOE,transoesophagealechocardiogra-phy;PE,pulmonaryembolus;LV,leftventricle. 920 © 2014 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland Anaesthesia 2014, 69, 919–927 Sharma and Fletcher | Training and accreditation in echocardiography would call advanced TTE skills (although this does not necessarily encompass such expert skills as TOE, stress and 3D echocardiography). This level of competence is normally acquired as part of a longer dedicated echocar- diography training programme with a signiﬁcantly greater logged casemix. There is obviously a continuum between basic and advanced skills, although the size of the step between the two is considerable. A document by the American College of Cardiology and the Ameri- can Heart Association sets out the cognitive skills required for basic echocardiography and beyond [20]. A pyramid of competency is a useful way of representing the different levels of achievement from basic upwards [21] (Fig. 1). Training As a prelude to this discussion, it is important to deﬁne training and accreditation in the context of echocardiography. Training is the supervised acquisi- tion of knowledge and technical skills by the learner to perform echocardiography to a pre-deﬁned standard of competence. Accreditation is the recognition of com- petence in echocardiography by a responsible profes- sional body. The professional body has the responsibility to set the training curriculum and assess the achievement of competency. The design of any TTE training programme needs to incorporate the technical and interpretative skills dis- cussed above. Arguably, technical skills are easier to teach as healthy volunteers can be used as training models. The interpretative skills require more experi- ence of pathological conditions and have led to the con- cept of a minimum casemix of supervised scans. The ability to integrate and utilise these two skills for patient beneﬁt is the ultimate goal of training and a lifelong pursuit. Like any concept of training, there are many methods and models to achieve competence. Some trainees will be able to reduce the time required to gain these skills by exerting more autonomy and employing a broader selection of available training tools. Others will stay on the steady path requiring more didactic teaching and the maximum set amount of time to achieve competence. Modern medical training should be able to accommodate both kinds of learners, while ensuring that the necessary minimum standard is met. Conventional point-of-care teaching Anaesthesia curricula in the UK do not currently spec- ify a requirement for any echocardiography training. There is also a signiﬁcant lack both of trainers and resources for delivery of training. However, there is a growing discussion on the potential beneﬁcial impact for services and patients if anaesthetist-delivered echo- Table 2 Schedule for suggested anaesthetic transthoracic echocardiographic assessment.

Anaesthetic management of trauma patients and peri-operative emergencies are areas of practice where basic echocardiography skills can have a potential impact [23–27]. Although pre-assessment is another area that has been identiﬁed for anaesthetic-delivered echocardiography, it remains controversial as to whether focused scanning would be adequate [28]. Training opportunities are limited in all these areas, so skills will need to be developed elsewhere and imported. Critical care is an area where these training opportuni- ties are rapidly becoming available. Although this is not yet in the curriculum for critical care training in the UK and there is not yet universal coverage, mentors and supervisors are now increasingly available to pro- vide the required training in basic TTE – probably as a result of the establishment of accreditation. Anaesthe- tists in the UK still receive dedicated training time in critical care and this provides an opportunity to acquire TTE skills. As discussed previously, acquisition of skills is a competence rather than time-based process – good and motivated trainees will use their time efﬁciently to gain TTE skills while in critical care and be able to apply them in anaesthesia. A signiﬁcant number of TTE trainers work in both critical care and anaesthesia, and can apply their training skills to both disciplines. The outpatient echocardiography department is a rich vein of training opportunity; UK sonographers have a high standard of training and perform the majority of scans. Clearly some form of formal or informal local contract will need to be observed to prevent disruption of service delivery and training overload of cardiac sonographers. Resources The availability of online educational resources has grown exponentially over the last few years and the same holds true for echocardiography resources. The quality of this material is more open to question and some expert direction is required, particularly for the would-be anaesthetic echocardiographer. Broadly, there are two categories of resource: free material; and mate- rial that commands a fee. The free resources can be of high quality and this is a tribute to the dedication of the authors; an example of this is the echocardiog- rapher.org site [29] or the Toronto General Hospital site [30]. The fee paying sites often structure a distance learning course with different levels of knowledge. These sites are usually accredited and created by pro- fessional societies or prominent individuals and pro- vide self-assessment and award certiﬁcation on course completion. An example of this kind of resource is the University of Melbourne’s, which is available through the AAGBI [31]. Print media are still invaluable aides to learning and often contain additional digital con- tent; a number of good texts are available for basic critical care echocardiography [32]. Simulation With the advent of echocardiography simulators, new opportunities for training away from the clinical envi- ronment have arisen. The basis of the simulator is a high ﬁdelity computerised 3D model of the heart with a greyscale echocardiography image plane; the more advanced simulators also have a dummy probe and a manikin [33, 34]. Movement of the probe over the manikin will produce a display of the ultrasound plane on the 3D model and the corresponding greyscale image – the haptic interface. Both TOE and TTE probe capability are available and some devices can simulate Doppler and pathological cardiac conditions. Simulation training can provide an insight into the 3D anatomy of the heart which is not readily apparent with conventional training [35, 36]. There is evidence that this can augment bedside echocardiography train- ing, both in TTE and TOE, and accelerate the rate of acquisition of knowledge – vitally important for time- limited anaesthesia training programmes [37–41]. This effect seems more pronounced earlier in the learning curve, possibly by helping to construct a framework for the novice’s 3D appreciation of the heart’s position within the thorax and the interface with the plane of the ultrasound transducer. Some of the observed improvement with simulation may also be an effect of dedicated training time away from the stress of the patient interface and in the company of an expert echocardiography trainer. Insertion of simulation into training programmes alongside bedside real-time scan- ning may help to realise the achievement of compe- tence within an abbreviated time frame. Simulation in anaesthetic training programmes is now an established part of the curriculum. Simula- tors have become high ﬁdelity and technologically 922 © 2014 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland Anaesthesia 2014, 69, 919–927 Sharma and Fletcher | Training and accreditation in echocardiography sophisticated, capable of reproducing the operating theatre or the labour ward. Training in the manage- ment of uncommon anaesthetic crises such as malig- nant hypothermia, pneumothorax and obstetric emergencies is largely dependent on experience obtained through simulation [42]. The echocardiogra- phy simulator, complete with pathological conditions, could now be available in the same geographical location. This provides the ability to develop scenar- ios where experience can be gained in echocardio- graphic diagnosis allied to the practical management of a clinical problem. A new technology development allows a TTE dummy probe-sensitive ‘skin’ to be ﬁt- ted on any simulation manikin. With the accompa- nying software, this can generate pathological echocardiographic images on a screen to accompany a simulation scenario (Heartworks; Inventive Medical Limited, London, UK). Accreditation The Society for Cardiovascular Anaesthetists (SCA) and American Society of Echocardiography collabo- rated to pioneer an examination for anaesthetists per- forming TOE. The ﬁrst examination took place in 1998 and rapidly became the international standard [1, 2]. This was an examination of knowledge alone rather than competency, successful candidates receiv- ing the status of testamur. The Association of Cardio- thoracic Anaesthetists (ACTA) and the British Society of Echocardiography (BSE) followed suit by launching UK accreditation in 2002. This accreditation was modelled on the existing TTE accreditation for cardiol- ogists and sonographers, and consisted of a curricu- lum, a formal examination and a logbook [5, 43]. A local supervisor was responsible for overseeing this process and verifying the competence of the individual. The European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthe- tists has subsequently developed a similar examination and accreditation [44]. Although the importance of echocardiography in critical care has long been recognised, availability and delivery have been much more variable and there has been considerable recent discussion around utility and training [6–8]. The Intensive Care Society and BSE recently collaborated to develop and launch both basic and advanced critical care echocardiography accredita- tions in TTE [9]. These processes contain a similar assessment of competency and knowledge under the direction of an accredited supervisor. Advanced echo- cardiography accreditations are now available for non- cardiologists – the BSE recently launched one for criti- cal care in the UK [45]. Table 3 presents advanced echocardiography accreditation schemes for sonogra- phers, cardiologists and non-cardiologists performing TTE [45–47]. Competency-based training is generally the inter- national standard for medical education schemes [48, 49] and although these UK echocardiography accredi- tations sit outside formal training, similar principles apply. Although there is an upper limit to the time during which the learner can acquire the set knowl- edge and skills, attainment of competency is the goal. Integral to this is the role of the supervisor, who, in addition to a training role, is the key to ensuring that Table 3 Overview of requirements to achieve advanced accreditation (or certiﬁcation) in echocardiography via inter- nationally recognised bodies.

There is evidence from parallel echocardi- ography disciplines that the learning curve for basic echocardiography may ﬂatten out after 30 supervised studies [50, 51]. As the bar is set at 50 supervised studies for Focused Echo Evaluation in Life Support and Focused Intensive Care Echocardiography, this would seem to indicate a safety margin for the devel- opment of competence. Within anaesthetic practice, ultrasound skills have become essential for performance of central venous cannulation and regional nerve blockade [52–55]. However, it is difﬁcult to translate training in limited procedural ultrasound using linear array probes into training in the use of echocardiography with phased array probes, multiple windows and imaging planes, and the simultaneous identiﬁcation of pathological conditions. Until very recently, there were no training and accreditation programmes in the non-cardiac anaesthesia ﬁeld. There is now a basic certiﬁcation in TOE for anaesthetists who do not routinely practice cardiac anaesthesia – a collaboration between the American Society of Anesthesiologists and the SCA [16]. This is reﬂected by the inclusion of TOE in some non-cardiac anaesthesia programmes in North America, particularly in the area of vascular anaesthe- sia [17]. Although anaesthetists are variably exposed to the use of TTE during their training in critical care in the UK, and some may achieve accreditation by this route, no national professional anaesthesia body has as yet come up with a speciﬁc accreditation. Transoesophageal echocardiography There has already been some discussion of TOE train- ing in anaesthesia, as this is well established in cardiac subspecialties around the world and provides a useful insight into developing training programmes and accreditation. Transoesophageal echocardiography is not so well established in non-cardiac anaesthesia, and some discussion of this is appropriate. In general, advanced level echocardiography is needed in the car- diac theatre, with the full range of diagnostic skills, including Doppler modes and, increasingly, 3D imag- ing. Transoesophageal echocardiography is now increasingly used in non-cardiac anaesthesia with accruing evidence of a positive impact on patient man- agement [56–59]. As discussed previously, there is also a new accreditation in basic TOE, with a vision to increase uptake in non-cardiac anaesthesia applications [1]. With the recent development and validation of a miniaturised disposable monoplane TOE probe, there exists the possibility for more widespread adoption of TOE as a mainstream intra-operative monitoring tech- nology [60, 61]. Despite classiﬁcation of TOE as a more advanced echocardiography application, the training aspects of TOE are, in many ways, simpler. A trainee who spends a year in a cardiac anaesthesia training programme can develop the required skills to adopt TOE for other forms of anaesthesia if the equip- ment can be made available. The same principles apply for the other modes of clinical and non-clinical train- ing, as discussed for TTE. Table 4 sets out available accreditations for TOE.

This is available in critical care for TTE or cardiac anaesthesia for TOE. When transferring skills to new areas, questions inevitably arise around the legitimacy and competence of the operator. Although enthusiasts may see themselves as pioneers, they may well face considerable difﬁculties in convincing others of a non-standard practice. For these reasons, and to afford some protection against any potential medicole- gal challenge, the security of an accreditation provides a base from which to consolidate new peri-operative echocardiography applications. As always, continuing audit of the quality of practice together with outcomes research is necessary to develop this ﬁeld further. Fig- ure 2 represents a decision ﬂowchart of pathways for the anaesthesia trainee who develops an interest in echocardiography. It may be the case that speciﬁc ac- creditations can be developed by anaesthetic training bodies in the near future. Experience informs us that availability of appropriate trainers and the develop- ment of embedded governance will determine the extent and the rate at which this step becomes possi- ble. Conclusion There has been considerable international adoption of echocardiography within cardiac anaesthesia and criti- cal care practice. To this end, effective systems of training and processes of accreditation and certiﬁcation have been established. There is therefore a considerable degree of experience to underpin a roll-out of echocar- diography to a wider group of anaesthetists in non- cardiac practice. Existing models of echocardiography training and accreditation can be used as a base on Figure 2 Decision ﬂowchart for echocardiography training in ana- esthesia.
