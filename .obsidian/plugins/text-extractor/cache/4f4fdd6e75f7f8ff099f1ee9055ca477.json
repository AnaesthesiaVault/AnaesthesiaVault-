{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240430144054.png","text":"There are two categories of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS): « Type 1 - Follows tissue injury, usually limb trauma * Type 2 - Follows known major peripheral nerve injury. The diagnosis is often a process of exclusion of known conditions that produce similar symptoms and signs. The symptoms include spontaneous pain, hyperalgesia or allodynia not corresponding to the confines of the sensory supply of a nerve. The signs may include trophic changes, oedema, sweating and changes in blood flow in the areas of pain. Management involves a multidisciplinary approach, focusing primarily on functional restoration. This is thought to be the best management strategy for CRPS; it is thought to reset central processing and normalise the peripheral sympathetic tone and desensitisation. This management approach involves: « Aperiod of graded exercise * Physiotherapy * Multimodal analgesia * Cognitive behavioural therapy * Counselling, and * The setting of goals. Whilst opioids are used in the treatment of chronic pain they are not the primary choice of analgesics because of side effects. These include tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, withdrawal symptoms that might be subtle or intermittent, and factors such as loss placebo effect. Should this process fail to improve the symptoms within two to four weeks then progression to more advanced and/or aggressive methods of treatment may be necessary. These include: « Sympathetic blockade * Transcutaneous nerve stimulation * Neuromodulation, and * Acupuncture.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
