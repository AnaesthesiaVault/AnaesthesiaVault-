If not contraindicated based on multidisciplinary discussion regarding risks of hemorrhage, intrave- nous/intra-arterial rtPa or mechanical thrombolysis should be considered as soon as possible for the surgical patient with an acute ischemic stroke (Opin- ion-based evidence, Category A). 2. In patients who receive rtPA (intravenous or intra-arterial) or undergo mechanical clot retrieval, systolic blood pressure above 180 mm| Hg and diastolic pressure above 105 mm Hg should be treated with anti-hypertensive drugs such as labetolol or nicardipine (Category A, Level 1). 3. The administration of aspirin (or other antiplatelet agents) as an adjunctive therapy within 24 hours of intravenous fibrinolysis is not recommended (Opinion- based evidence, Category A). 4. Supplemental oxygen should be provided to maintain oxygen saturation >94% (Opinion-based evidence, Category A). 5. Airway support and ventilator assistance are recom- mended for treatment of patients with decreased con- sciousness or bulbar dysfunction that causes compromise of respiration (Opinion-based evidence, Category A). 6.
