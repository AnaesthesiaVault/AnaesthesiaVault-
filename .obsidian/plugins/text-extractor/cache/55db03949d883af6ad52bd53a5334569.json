{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240420151729.png","text":"The responsibility of the anaesthetist does not end with the handover to the recovery staff and he or she or an appointed designate should be available in the theatre complex until it can be reasonably assumed that the anaesthetic has worn off. + The anaesthetist must formally hand over care of a patient to a recovery room nurse o other appropriately trained member of staff. - The patient should be breathing spontaneously and oxygen saturation should be appropriate. - The patient should have recovered from the neuromuscular blocker, as determined by the return of the train-of-four or by appropriate clinical signs of recovery, vis-4-vis head lift or hand squeeze. - The patient should be haemodynamically stable. If excessive blood loss has occurred, the anaesthetist should remain with the patient until adequate volume resuscitation has occurred and appropriate measures to test haemoglobin level and the ordering of homologous blood have been carried out. - The patient should have adequate control of pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting. The patient is handed over to the RR nurse by the anaesthetist, assisted by the anaesthetic nurse, and the scrub sister. + The patient should be identified during the hand over. - The R nurse should take note of the procedure, condition of the patient, anaesthetic given, pain control needed and any other specific orders (written/verbal) given by the anaesthetist or scrubsister (surgeon). + The RR nurse should not accept full responsibility for the patient if not satisfied with the condition of the patient or until the patient is extubated, unless otherwise expressly agreed with the anaesthetist. Extubation remains the responsibility of the anaesthetist. - All monitors, e.g. Sa0,, B, pulse, capnograph should be connected and observations should be documented. The RR nurse must be vigilant in monitoring physical changes and assessing their significance. - Life-threatening situations and anaesthetic-related problems should be recognised, acted on and reported to the anaesthesia provider, e.q. return of protective reflexes, circulation/ haemodynamic shifts, varying levels of consciousness, nausea and vomiting, pain level and airway dysfunction. + The effect of all interventions must be evaluated. - Pain control as prescribed by the anaesthesia provider should be administered. - The R nurse provides continuity through responsible discharge and professional hand over of the patient to the ward staff only after verbal communication with and written consent of the anaesthetist.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
