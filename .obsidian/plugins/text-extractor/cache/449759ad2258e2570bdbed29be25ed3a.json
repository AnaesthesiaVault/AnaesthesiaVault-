A meta-analysis {Chong — 2018) included data from 27 trials of transfusion triggers in critically ill patients and perioperative patients (all trials were judged to be at moderate or high risk of bias). Their findings were that a restrictive strategy reduced mortality in critically ill patients (OR 0.82; 95%Cl 0.70-0.97) whereas restrictive strategies were associated with an increase in mortality in surgical patients (OR1.31; 95%CI 0.94-1.82). Trials using a transfusion trigger of 28g/dL did not show any difference in mortality in either the perioperative or critically ill group. This meta-analysis concluded that there is sufficient data to show that a transfusion threshold of 7-8g/dL significantly reduces mortality and adverse events in the critically ill population; however, in the perioperative population, although there is a signal that a restrictive transfusion threshold increases the risk of mortality, this finding does not reach statistical significance and lacks sufficient power. Further research is needed in perioperative patients to definitively dictate transfusion triggers in this subgroup of patients. Perioperative blood management m vt 8 nNOW ‘J/\\(l QCD:Z\\VU'C . There has been a drive in recent years to abandon the practice of transfusion triggers (which use a “one-size fits all” approach), and a movement towards evidence-based, patient-specific care, where each patient must be assessed on an individual basis regarding the risks and benefits of managing their anaemia. This concept of patient blood management (PBM) is very topical at present {and it's a topic on its own, so I'm only going to touch on it herell}. It is defined as “the timely application of evidence-based medical and surgical concepts designed to maintain haemoglobin concentration, optimise haemostasis and minimize blood loss to improve patient outcome”.
