These effects are magnified by the stress response induced by surgery Current preoperative fasting guidelines for adult patients undergoing elective surgery recommend a 2+h fast for liquids and a 6-h fast for solids Preoperative oral CHO drinks are safe, reduce insulin resistance, and improve patients’ well-being Antibiotic Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing colorectal surgery must ‘prophylaxis cover aerobic and anaerobic flora, according to international quidelines Antibiotic prophylaxis should be completed within 1 h before surgical inision. Intraoperative dosing depends on the half-life of the antibiotic used and on the surgical blood loss.
