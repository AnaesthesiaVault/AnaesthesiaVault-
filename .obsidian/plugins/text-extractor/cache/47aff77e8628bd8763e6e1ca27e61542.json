The use of perfluorochemicals, rather than nitrogen, as the inert carrier of oxygen and carbon dioxide offers a number of theoretical advantages for the treatment of acute lung injury, including: » Reducing surface tension by maintaining a fluid interface with alveoli. > Opening of collapsed alveoli by hydraulic pressure with a lower risk of barotrauma. > Providing a reservoir in which oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged with pulmonary capillary blood. » Functioning as a high efficiency heat exchanger. » Mobilizing alveolar and airway debris and exudates. Two techniques of LV have been investigated: i} Total liquid ventilation where the entire lung is filled with PFC requiring specialised equipment to administer and remove the viscous PFC’s. i) Partial liquid ventilation where a volume equivalent to that of the functional residual capacity is slowly delivered to the lung whilst administering conventional gas ventilation. Despite its theoretical advantages, efficacy studies have been disappointing and the optimal clinical use of LV has yet to be defined. 2.6 NEGATIVE PRESSURE VENTILATORS Negative-pressure ventilators work by intermittently applying a sub-atmospheric pressure to the chest wall and abdomen; this increases transpulmonary pressure and causes atmospheric pressure at the mouth to inflate the lungs. Patients with stable or slowly progressive neuromuscular diseases, central hypoventilation, or chest wall deformities are the best candidates for non-invasive negative-pressure ventilation. Studies of the use of the body ventilator or ‘poncho wrap’ for patients with acute respiratory failure and COPD, neuromuscular disease, or chest wall deformity suggest some benefit from these devices, but the studies have not been prospective and controlled.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
