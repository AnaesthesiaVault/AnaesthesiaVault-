The use of intraoperative high-inspired oxygen fraction (Fio, = 0.8) to prevent surgical-site infections has shown conflicting results. However, patients undergoing colorectal surgery might particularly — benefitfromthisintervention Myorelaxation Short- or intermediate-acting muscle relaxants are recommended Adequate muscle relaxation is essential to guarantee optimal surgical conditions, especially during laparoscopic colorectal surgery Neuromuscular blockade must be monitored (TOF, double-burst, or tetanic stimulation pattern) throughout the intraoperative period. Quantitative assessment (acceleromyography) of neuromuscular function is more reliable than qualitative assessment (visual or tactile) in identifying patients with residual paralysis Prevention of ‘Core temperature must be monitored and hypothermia (core _mpothermis____wemperatwe 36 Qavolded ______ Intraoperative In colorectal patients treated within an ERAS program, minimization of hemodynamic preoperative fasting, avoidance of MBP, a more rational and management evidence-based intravenous fluid administration, and early resumption of oral intake have significantly reduced the amount of perioperative intravenous fiuids needed GDT seems beneficial in high-risk patients and in patients undergoing surgery with extensive blood loss (>7 mUkg) Iso-oncotic arystalloid solutions should be used and 0.9% saline solutions avoided Colloid should be avoided in patents with preexisting renal diseases and in septic patients Anemia thresholds triggering blood transfusions cannot be currently recommended, as hemoglobin levels resulting in tissue hypoxia are patient-specific The decision to transfuse blood should be made on an individual basis, depending on the clinical context, serum lactate levels, central oxygen venous saturation, and patient comorbidities PONV prophylaxis PONV prophylaxis is an essential to facilitate early feeding Patients at high risk of PONV can be identified PONV prophylaxis guidelines must be followed (continued on next page)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
