Patients are exhausted, little physiologic reserve, high risk of rapid desaturation and hypotension after receiving sedating medications and neuromuscular blocking agents 3. Pre-oxygenation via active breathing through a bag valve mask 4. Ventilation should be delivered by bag and mask using a small tidal volume and high inspiratory flow rate with a prolonged expiratory phase 5. Start with patient sitting upright, then once the patient loses consciousness place the patient in a supine position and perform laryngoscopy and intubation 6. Large endotracheal tube (8 - 9 mm), nasal intubation not recommended 7. Pre-treatment with lignocaine (1.5 mg/kg IV three minutes before induction) 8.
