Lichtenstein, MD, FCCP; and Gilbert A. Mezie`re, MD Background: This study assesses the potential of lung ultrasonography to diagnose acute respiratory failure. Methods: This observational study was conducted in university-affiliated teaching-hospital ICUs. We performed ultrasonography on consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, comparing lung ultrasonography results on initial presentation with the final diagnosis by the ICU team. Uncertain diagnoses and rare causes (frequency < 2%) were excluded. We included 260 dyspneic patients with a definite diagnosis. Three items were assessed: artifacts (horizontal A lines or vertical B lines indicating interstitial syndrome), lung sliding, and alveolar consolidation and/or pleural effusion. Com- bined with venous analysis, these items were grouped to assess ultrasound profiles. Results: Predominant A lines plus lung sliding indicated asthma (n \u0001 34) or COPD (n \u0001 49) with 89% sensitivity and 97% specificity. Multiple anterior diffuse B lines with lung sliding indicated pulmonary edema (n \u0001 64) with 97% sensitivity and 95% specificity. A normal anterior profile plus deep venous thrombosis indicated pulmonary embolism (n \u0001 21) with 81% sensitivity and 99% specificity. Anterior absent lung sliding plus A lines plus lung point indicated pneumothorax (n \u0001 9) with 81% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Anterior alveolar consolidations, anterior diffuse B lines with abolished lung sliding, anterior asymmetric interstitial patterns, posterior consolidations or effusions without anterior diffuse B lines indicated pneumonia (n \u0001 83) with 89% sensitivity and 94% specificity. The use of these profiles would have provided correct diagnoses in 90.5% of cases. Conclusions: Lung ultrasound can help the clinician make a rapid diagnosis in patients with acute respiratory failure, thus meeting the priority objective of saving time.

Emergency cases do not always present in conditions that are ideal for immediate diagnosis, which sometimes compromises outcome.1–3 Physical examination and bedside radiog- raphy are imperfect,4,5 resulting in a need for sophisti- cated test results that delay management. Ultrasound has long shown its utility for plain organs.6 Although the lung has traditionally been excluded from its repertoire,7 studies have proven that this belief was unfounded.8 Since 1989 in our ICU, using devoted logistics,9 the concept of whole- body ultrasound was developed and extended to the lungs for managing critical situations.10,11 Lung ul- trasonography is becoming a standard tool in critical care. Accurate bedside detection of thoracic disor- ders should help diagnose acute respiratory failure.12 This study examines this potential, as discussed previously.13 *From the Service de Re´ animation Me´ dicale (Dr. Lichtenstein), Hoˆ pital Ambroise-Pare´ , F-92 Boulogne, Paris-Ouest; and Service de Re´ animation Polyvalente (Dr. Mezie` re), Centre Hospitalier, F-92 Saint-Cloud, Paris-Ouest, France.

The official diagnosis was established in the hospitalization report using standardized tests by the ICU staff and not including lung ultrasound data (Table 1). Sixteen patients never received a definite diagnosis, 16 patients had several official diagnoses, and 9 patients had rare (ie, frequency \u0002 2%) diagnoses. To simplify this study, these patients were subsequently excluded (Table 1). Acute respiratory failure was defined based on the classical clinical and biological criteria for requiring admission to the ICU. All patients had an ultrasound test by investigators (D.L., G.M.) who did not participate in the patient’s manage- ment, which was undertaken by other ICU members blinded to the ultrasound results. The ultrasound test was performed without interrupting management at the time of ICU admis- sion (ie, within 20 min) and lasted \u0002 3 min. The internal review board of the hospital approved this study and waived the requirement for informed consent. Table 1—Final Diagnoses and Methods of Diagnosis Diagnoses Methods For all patients History, clinical examination, radiography read by radiologists, CT when available (n \u0001 38), favorable clinical progression under treatment, and: Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (referred to as pulmonary edema) \u0003n \u0001 64\u0004 Evaluation of cardiac function using echocardiography, functional tests, and American Heart Association recommendations Pneumonia (n \u0001 83) Infectious profile, radiologic asymmetry, microorganism isolated (blood, invasive tests), recovery with antibiotics.

Patients were investigated in a semirecumbent position, or were supine if intu- bated (n \u0001 35). Scans were longitudinal. The pleural line, sought between two rib shadows, indicates the pleural layers. The normal lung14 displays lung sliding, a movement in rhythm with respiration at the pleural line, indicating sliding of the visceral pleura against the parietal pleura,15 and A lines (Fig 2), these repetitive horizontal artifacts arising from the pleural line generated by subpleural air, which, either intraalveolar or pure (pneumothorax), blocks ultra- sound waves. Normal interlobular septa are not detected. Three signs with dual answers were assessed, as follow. Artifact Analysis: A or B Lines: The B line is the name given to an artifact with seven features: a hydroaeric comet-tail artifact; arising from the pleural line; hyperechoic; well defined; spread- ing up indefinitely; erasing A lines; and moving with lung sliding when lung sliding is present (Fig 3). It reflects the coexistence of elements with a major acoustic impedance gradient, such as fluid and air. Fluid at the subpleural interlobular septum surrounded by air-filled alveoli (ie, septal edema) fulfills this condition. Three or more B lines in a single view are called B \u0005 lines. B \u0005 lines indicate the subpleural part of interstitial syndrome.16 Other comet-tail artifacts can be seen; none has B line characteristics.14 Lung Sliding: Present or Abolished: Abolition (Fig 4) occurs when the visceral pleura does not slide against parietal pleura (inflammatory adherences, loss of lung expansion, atelectasis, apnea, chronic symphysis) or is separated (pneumothorax, pneu- monectomy). If abolished lung sliding is associated with A lines, the search for pneumothorax is mandatory. The lung point is a specific sign of pneumothorax, alternating lung sliding and abolished lung sliding plus A lines at the same location.17 Alveolar Consolidation and/or Pleural Effusion: Absent or Present: Pleural effusion classically yields an anechoic-dependent pattern (Fig 5),18 an inconstant criterion. The roughly quadran- gular shape with a regular lower border (the visceral pleura, called the lung line) was required for the diagnosis. The inspira- tory shift of the lung line toward the pleural line is called the sinusoid sign. The sensitivity of these signs is 92%, and specificity is 97%.5,19 Alveolar consolidation20 results in fluid-filled alveoli. The alveolar-interstitial interfaces generate reflections yielding a tissular pattern, absence of the lung line, absence of the sinusoid sign. Ultrasound sensitivity is 90%, and specificity is 98%.21 Figure 1. Ultrasound areas. Stage 1 defines the investigation of the anterior chest wall (zone 1) in a supine patient (1\u0007 in this semire- cumbent patient). Stage 2 adds the lateral wall (zone 2) [left panel]. Stage 3 adds the posterolateral chest wall using a short probe, moving the patient only minimally (zone 3) [right panel]. Each wall is divided into upper and lower halves, resulting in six areas of investigation. Note the shape of the microconvex probe, which allows satisfactory analysis of the intercostal space, and satisfactorily controlled compression maneuvers at the veins investigated in this study: internal jugular, subclavian, iliofemoropopliteal veins, and as far as possible, inferior vena cava and calf veins. Figure 2. Normal lung surface. Longitudinal scan of an inter- costal space. Left panel: Pleural line and A line (real-time). The pleural line is located 0.5 cm below the rib line in the adult. Its visible length between two ribs in the longitudinal scan is approximately 2 cm. The upper rib, pleural line, and lower rib (vertical arrows) outline a characteristic pattern called the bat sign. The horizontal lines arising from the pleural line (horizontal arrows) are separated by regular intervals that are equal to the distance between the skin and the pleural line. These were called A lines. A lines are usually large (see upper line) but can be shorter (lower line), which has no clinical significance. Right panel: M mode. An obvious difference appears on either side of the pleural line (arrow). The motionless superficial layers gener- ate horizontal lines. Lung dynamics generate lung sliding (sandy pattern). This pattern is called the seashore sign. Figure 3. Interstitial syndrome. These vertical comet-tail arti- facts arise strictly from the pleural line, are well defined (laser- like), hyperechoic, move with lung sliding, spread to the edge of the screen without fading, and erase A lines (dotted arrows indicate their theoretical location). This pattern defines B lines. Several B lines in a single view, reminiscent of a rocket at lift-off, are called lung rockets, or B \u0005 lines (featuring here, B3 lines). Diffuse lung rockets indicate interstitial syndrome. One or two B lines in a single view, referred to as the b line, have no pathologic significance. This patient had cardiogenic pulmonary edema. www.chestjournal.org CHEST / 134/1/ JULY, 2008 119 Deep venous thrombosis was sought using the same probe.22 Visualization of anatomic echoic intraluminal thrombosis or absence of compressibility was considered as a positive finding (Fig 1). An examination combined an anterior approach (analyz- ing artifacts, lung sliding, alveolar consolidation), a lateral sub- posterior search for posterolateral alveolar and/or pleural syn- drome (PLAPS), and venous analysis. Study Design The signs observed in each disease were methodically col- lected; then the ultrasound data were compared with the diag- nosis established by the ICU team. Results This study included 260 patients with a definite diagnosis: 140 men and 120 women (mean age, 68 years; range, 22 to 91 years; SD, 16 years). Signs Observed Pulmonary Edema: Pulmonary edema was ob- served in 64 patients. Anterior-predominant bilateral B \u0005 lines were observed in 62 cases (diffuse in 59, predominant involvement of lower halves in 3). Anterior-predominant bilateral A lines were seen in two cases. Anterior lung sliding was always pre- served. In 56 cases, PLAPS was detectable. One patient (with B \u0005 lines) had internal jugular vein thrombosis. COPD: COPD was observed in 49 patients. In 38 cases, anterior-predominant bilateral A lines with lung sliding and no PLAPS were observed. In five cases, the same pattern with abolished lung sliding (without lung point) was seen. Anterior-predominant bilateral B lines were present in three cases, anterior consolidation in one. PLAPS was seen in six cases. Status Asthmaticus: Status asthmaticus was observed in 34 patients. Asthma gave anterior-predominant A lines with lung sliding in all cases, posterior consolida- tion in one, and calf thrombosis in another. Pulmonary Embolism: Pulmonary was observed in 21 patients. Twenty patients had anterior predominant A lines with lung sliding. One had anterior consolidation with absent lung sliding. PLAPS was found in 11 patients. Seventeen patients had venous thrombosis. Pneumothorax: Pneumothorax was observed in nine patients. Abolished anterior lung sliding was associated with anterior-predominant A lines in all cases. Lateroposterior lung point was present in eight cases. PLAPS was found in five cases. Pneumonia: Pneumonia was observed in 83 pa- tients. In 75 cases, PLAPS was present. In six cases, an anterior-predominant bilateral B \u0005 pattern was associated with lung sliding (with PLAPS in four cases). In nine cases, anterior-predominant bilateral B \u0005 lines were associated with abolished lung sliding; Figure 4. Pneumothorax. Left panel (real-time): one significant item is the complete absence of the B line. Lower arrows: A lines; upper arrow: pleural line. Right panel (M mode): this succession of horizontal lines indicates complete absence of dynamics at, and below, the pleural line (arrowheads). This pattern is called the stratosphere sign. The lung point (not featured here) confidently rules in the diagnosis. Figure 5. Pleural effusion and alveolar consolidation; typical example of PLAPS. Left panel: real-time, stage 2. The quad sign: a pleural effusion on expiration (E) is delineated between the pleural line (upper white arrows) and the lung line, always regular, which indicates the visceral pleura (lower white arrows). The shred sign: a lower-lobe alveolar consolidation (LL) yields a tissular pattern, characteristically limited by the lung line (or the pleural line when there is no effusion) and in depth by an irregular border (black arrows), the shred line, as in connection with aerated lung. Below, air artifacts are displayed. Between consolidation and spleen (S) is the diaphragm, a basic landmark in stage 2. Right panel: time-motion demonstrates the sinusoid sign, a basic dynamic sign of pleural effusion. The sign will not be generated by alveolar consolidation, which behaves like a solid lesion. 120 Original Research embolism PLAPS was always associated. In 12 cases, anterior- predominant B \u0005 lines in one lung coexisted with predominant A lines in the contralateral lung; PLAPS was seen in 11 cases. In 18 cases, anterior consolidations were observed; lung sliding was abol- ished in 9 of them; PLAPS was associated in 16 cases. In 34 cases, an anterior-predominant A pat- tern with lung sliding was associated with PLAPS. Lung sliding was abolished in 28 cases. Three pa- tients had a normal examination. Ultrasound Accuracy We retained characteristic combinations of signs that produced specificities \b 90% (Tables 3, 4). We suggest a practical nomenclature that avoids repeti- tive descriptions (Fig 6). The A profile designates anterior predominant bilateral A lines associated with lung sliding (with possible focalized B lines). The A’ profile is an A profile with abolished lung sliding and without lung point. The B profile desig- nates anterior-predominant bilateral B \u0005 lines asso- ciated with lung sliding (with possible focalized A lines). The B’ profile is a B profile with abolished lung sliding. The A/B profile designates anterior- predominant B \u0005 lines on one side, predominant A lines on the other. The C profile designates anterior alveolar consolidation(s). PLAPS profile is described in the Appendix. The normal profile associates the A profile without PLAPS (regardless of posterior A or B lines) [online document 1]. Ultrasound Accuracy Rates For pulmonary edema, the B profile had 95% specificity and 97% sensitivity. For COPD and asthma (considered together for purposes of simplic- ity), the normal profile had a 97% specificity and a Table 3—Combined Results* Diagnoses A Profile Plus PLAPS Normal Profile, and A’ Profile Without PLAPS B Profile B’ Profile C Profile A/B Profile Lung Point Pulmonary edema 2 0 62 1 00 0 0 COPD or asthma 4 75 1 30 1 0 0 Pulmonary embolism 10 8 10 9 00 10 00 Pneumothorax 0 1 0 0 0 0 8 Pneumonia 35 3 6 9 18 12 0 *Exponents indicate No. of cases with venous thrombosis (datum without exponent means negative venous exploration). To simplify this Table, COPD and asthma are considered together; three columns in Table 2 were combined because analysis showed no loss in performance. One patient with pneumonia and the A’ profile plus PLAPS was inserted in the A profile plus PLAPS column. The term lung point implies abolished anterior sliding associated with anterior A lines.

For pulmonary embolism, the A profile plus venous thrombosis showed 99% speci- ficity and 81% sensitivity. For pneumothorax, absent anterior lung sliding, anterior A lines, and a positive search for lung point yielded 100% specificity and 88% sensitivity. For pneumonia, specificity and sen- sitivity were, respectively, 100% and 11% for the B’ profile, 100% and 14% for the A/B profile, 99% and 11% for the C profile, and 96% and 42% for the A profile plus PLAPS. These four profiles indicated pneumonia with 94% specificity and 89% sensitivity. For all patients, lung ultrasound yielded correct diagnoses in 90.5% of cases. Discussion Briefly, the B profile (anterior interstitial syndrome with lung sliding) indicated pulmonary edema. The B’ profile (lung sliding abolished) indicated pneumonia. The A/B profile (asymmetric anterior interstitial syn- drome) and the C profile (anterior consolidation) indi- cated pneumonia, as did the A profile plus PLAPS. The A profile plus venous thrombosis indicated pulmonary embolism. A normal profile indicated COPD/asthma. These results correspond to physiopathologic pat- terns, particularly echoed by ultrasound artifacts, that have been in clinical use since 1994.23 The pleural line is superficial. Most acute disorders reach it: acute interstitial changes involve deep as well as subpleural areas16,24; most (98.5%) cases of acute alveolar consolidation abut the pleura21; pneumotho- rax and pleural effusions always abut the wall.14 The high acoustic impedance gradient between air and fluid generates artifacts. Air stops ultrasounds, and fluid facilitates their transmission. The air-fluid ratio is 1 in pneumothorax; roughly 0.98 in asthma, COPD, and normal lungs25; roughly 0.95 in interstitial syn- drome24; near zero in alveolar consolidation; and zero in pleural effusion (online document 2). COPD and asthma are bronchial diseases assumed to yield a normal lung surface. This explains the ability of ultrasound to distinguish these entities from pulmonary edema.26 In pulmonary edema, the transudate under pressure is pushed along interlobular septa against gravity, up to the anterior wall, explaining the quasiconstant ante- rior, symmetric interstitial patterns (indicating an- terior Kerley lines). Edema of interlobular septa is constant and early.27,28 The B profile (with or with- out PLAPS due to gravitational filling of dependent alveoli) characterizes pulmonary edema with high accuracy. Posterior interstitial syndrome was not sought, since gravitational interstitial changes are phys- iologic.24 Pulmonary edema produces transsudate, which is not supposed to generate inflammatory adher- ences (a factor that may hinder lung sliding, see below). Pulmonary embolism does not yield interstitial change. A normal anterior lung surface was usually seen, as previously reported.29 None of 92 patients with anterior interstitial patterns had pulmonary embolism. The positive predictive value of deep venous thrombosis was 89%, but 94% if associated with the A profile, suggesting that the search for venous thrombosis should be associated with lung analysis (Table 2). Pneumothorax features have been extensively described.14,15,30 Pneumonia yields numerous signs. The frequent abolition of lung sliding (B’ profile) is explainable by inflammatory adherences due to exudate.31 Abol- ished lung sliding again shows low specificity for pneumothorax (22% positive predictive value here). Pneumonia can be found in a wide variety of loca- Figure 6. Ultrasound profiles. Left panel: The A profile is defined as predominant A lines plus lung sliding at the anterior surface in supine or half-sitting patients (stage 1/1\u0007). This profile suggests COPD, embolism, and some posterior pneumonia. Pulmonary edema is nearly ruled out. Middle: The B profile is defined as predominant B \u0005 lines in stage 1. This profile suggests cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and nearly rules out COPD, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax. Right panel:anA/B \u0005 profile, massive B lines at the left lung, A lines at the right lung. This profile is usually associated with pneumonia. 122 Original Research tions, which explains the asymmetric patterns (AB profile), anterior consolidations (C profile), or lack of anterior interstitial patterns (A profile). Note that among seven patients initiating ARDS from pneu- monia, only one had the B profile. Briefly, ultra- sound highlighted distinctions between pneumonia and pulmonary edema. If confirmed by further data, this may provide a potential means of differentiating hemodynamic from permeability-related pulmonary edema. Suggested Algorithm Anterior lung sliding is checked first. Its presence discounts pneumothorax. Anterior B lines are sought. The B profile suggests pulmonary edema. The B’, A/B, and C profiles suggest pneumonia. The A profile prompts a search for venous thrombosis. If present, pulmonary embolism is considered. If absent, PLAPS is sought. Its presence (A profile plus PLAPS) suggests pneumonia; its absence (normal profile) suggests COPD/asthma (Fig 7). This algorithm, using ultrasound alone, would have retrospectively given an accurate diagnosis in 90.5% of cases. Its routine integration into the clinical approach would give even better results. This algorithm was called Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency—the BLUE protocol. When your patient is blue, promptly perform a BLUE protocol. The absence of echocardi- ography in this algorithm stems from the fact that, even if yielding data of primary importance, it gives indirect arguments, whereas lung ultrasound provides a direct approach to acute respiratory failure. In practice, a cardiac analysis completes our approach. Clinical Implications Using lung ultrasound saves time and decreases the need for CT, whose drawbacks include delayed- care implementation, irradiation,32–34 cost (therefore available only in resource-rich countries), and the re- quired supine position. Lung ultrasound is nearly equivalent to CT in detecting most disorders,5 can be repeated at will, and provides additional information.35 Online document 1 shows the number of erroneous initial diagnoses using conventional tools. One fourth of the patients in the first 2 h had erroneous or uncertain initial diagnoses. Many more received inappropriate therapy. Lung ultrasound generates standardized, repro- ducible patterns, explaining the high interobserver agreement.5,11,21 Feasibility is high. Lung ultrasound may appear complex at first sight but simply requires a change in thinking.36 Once the process has been learned, a step-by-step use will make it routine.37– 44 Limitations The operators in this study have several years of experience. They were not blinded to the patient’s clinical presentation, yet ultrasound profiles were established based on objective signs. Among the erroneous results (9.5%), some re- sulted from limitations of this simplified ultrasound approach: problems distinguishing pulmonary edema and interstitial pneumonia, or embolism without thrombosis. Others can be explained by possible flaws in the reference tests: “decompensated COPD” associated with the B profile or PLAPS, or “pulmo- nary edema” without the B profile. Figure 7. A decision tree utilizing lung ultrasonography to guide diagnosis of severe dyspnea. www.chestjournal.org CHEST / 134/1/ JULY, 2008 123 As regards the excluded patients, among rare causes of dyspnea, massive pleural effusion was not a diagnostic problem. Chronic interstitial diseases pro- duce B lines; the solution deserves a subtle approach that cannot be discussed herein. Among undefined official diagnosis, note that all patients had one characteristic ultrasound profile. Among patients with several official diagnoses, their inclusion would require an accurate way to determine the respective role of each mechanism involved in respiratory distress. The choice of the material can be decisive. Cumber- some echocardiographic units with cardiac probes usu- ally have insufficient resolution for the lung. Recent ultracompact technologies (not a mandatory require- ment in hospital settings), if technologically designed for cardiac investigations, with no consideration for the lung, will not solve this problem. Both systems usually present additional drawbacks: cost, switch-on time, keyboard design that prevents rapid disinfec- tion, and modes that seek to remove artifacts. The choice of the probe is critical. Vascular probes usually prevent deep analysis and artifact recogni- tion. Abdominal probes have inappropriate ergo- nomics but are perhaps the least problematic in terms of resolution. The authors use a low-cost, 31-cm large, hybrid machine with a compact design and flat keyboard, available since 1992 and still being manufac- tured, without Doppler.45,46 Their microconvex probe, the optimal type of probe for the lungs, is also ideal for emergency whole-body analysis.22 Conclusions Lung ultrasound immediately provided diagnosis of acute respiratory failure in 90.5% of cases. It can there- fore be added to the armamentarium of critical care.47 The additional value of saving time should provide prompter relief for these severely dyspneic patients. Appendix Lung Artifacts Nomenclature A lines indicate horizontal repetitive artifacts originating from the pleural line. B lines indicate vertical, comet-tail artifacts originat- ing from the pleural line, long, hyperechoic, well-defined, dy- namic, erasing A lines. Ultrasound Profiles A profile represents anterior-predominant bilateral A lines asso- ciated with lung sliding. A’ profile represents A profile with abolished lung sliding and without lung point. B profile repre- sents anterior-predominant bilateral B lines associated with lung sliding. B’ profile represents B profile with abolished lung sliding. A/B profile represents anterior-predominant B \u0005 lines at one side and predominant A lines at the other. C profile represents anterior alveolar consolidation(s). PLAPS represents posterior and/or lateral alveolar and/or pleural syndrome. All these defini- tions are based on the patient being supine or semirecumbent.
