There may be some effect , which is eventually triggered when the patient becomes sufficiently hypothermic to reach the core temperatures of 33-35°C required for vasoconstriction (although volatile anaesthetics diminish thermoregulatory vasoconstriction). This means that heat is retained at the core and its transmission to the peripheries is diminished. The total heat content of the body may continue to fall — heat is still being lost from the peripheries but the core temperature remains constant.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
