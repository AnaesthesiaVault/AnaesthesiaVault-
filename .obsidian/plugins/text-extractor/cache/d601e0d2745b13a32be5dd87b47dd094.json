For individuals on_aspirin categorize reason for utilization: « Primary prophylaxis — absence of established cardiovascular disease or risk factor. * Sccondary prophylaxis — presence of cardiovascular disease. Process the anatomical location of procedural intervention into decision-making. « Intracanal vs extracanal spinal procedures * Cervicothoracic neuraxial area or lumbosacral neuraxial area. o Surrounding vascular structures at risk for penetration. Review appropriate radiographic imaging to identify and understand anatomic challenges * Cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal stenosis that that alter spinal canal anatomy « Epidural fibrosis and significant scar tissue from previous surgical intervention Identify and manage pharmacologic coagulopathies * Understand drug elimination and appropriate discontinuation time. * Determine appropriate timing for reinitiation of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. * Practice Informed decision-making involving procedural physician, prescribing medical physician, and patient. Employ post-procedure surveillance for the detection of bleeding complications","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
