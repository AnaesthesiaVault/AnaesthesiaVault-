This is the most important coagulation abnomalities seen in mid perioperative hypothermia and is related to focal temperalure, not the core temperature. In addition to a qualtative reduction in platelet function, there is also a reduction in circulating numbers as platelets become sequestered in the enlarged hypothermic liver. Enzymes of the coagulation cascade are also impaired, this may not be seen in laboratory tests, as these are carried outat 37°C. Viscosity aiso increases by 2-3% for every 1°C drop in temperature. 8. Phamacological Drug metabolism markedly decreases with periaperative hypothermia. A 2°C drop in core temperature more than doubles the duration of action of vecuronium; atracuriurn is less affected. This may be due to the reduction in hepatic metabolism seen in hypothermia. The twitch strength is also reduced by core hypothermia, even in the absence of neuromuscular blockade. MAC is reduced by 5% for every 1°C drop in temperature ~ at 20°C, no anaesthesi: is required to prevent movement in response to a skin incision. The metabolism of midazolam changes during hypothermia. If administered by a continuous infusion, its systemic clearance is reduced 100x, leading to a 5x increase in blood concentration. 9. Endocrine Decreased insulin release and activity 10. Immune function Hypothermia directly impairs immune function. Vasoconstriction also reduces blood flow and therefore oxygen supply to healing tissues. A randomised controlled triaf involving 200 patients undergaing colorectal surgery found 19% of wound infections in the hypothermia group (mean temperature 34.7°C) compared ta 6% of wound iifections in normothermic patients (mean temperature 36.6°C). The hypothermic group also had a prolonged stay in hospital by 2.6 days.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
