And in any meeting, you learn more about databases that are being used for investigative purposes and that are being treated as if they were observational studies themselves. there are indeed many misunderstandings about databases. the main of which being the absolute forgetting of the first principle of data collection, namely, that we should not collect data just for the sake of it, without explicit and specified objec- tives [1]. What is a database? Database is a commonly misused term in reference to any set of data entered into a computer. Actually, most of the time we are talking about datasets or flat-type data: spreadsheets with columns that identify variables or fields and rows that identify patients or study units. A database is a more complex collection of interrelated data without unnecessary redundancy and independent of the software used [1]. A database serves a main purpose, to organise data. It does so by establishing several layers of relationships— databases are hierarchical. Data are introduced in differ- ent tables accounting for the different levels, which, most crucially, are all interrelated. In clinical databases, the main level is usually the subject/patient, and then, the second- ary levels may be visits or hospital stays or treatments or adverse events, all of which can be repeated over time peri- odically or in spontaneous observed occurrence (table 1). An additional key point in defining a database is the notion of time. Databases commonly organise data over different levels and over time, where time can be measured as the time between visits or between treatments or adverse events, etc. In this sense, medical databases are closely Abstract there are many misunderstandings about data- bases. Database is a commonly misused term in reference to any set of data entered into a computer. However, true databases serve a main purpose, organising data. they do so by establishing several layers of relationships; databases are hierarchical. Databases commonly organise data over different levels and over time, where time can be meas- ured as the time between visits, or between treatments, or adverse events, etc. In this sense, medical databases are closely related to longitudinal observational studies, as databases allow the introduction of data on the same patient over time. Basically, we could establish four types of data- bases in medicine, depending on their purpose: (1) admin- istrative databases, (2) clinical databases, (3) registers, and (4) study-oriented databases. But a database is a useful tool for a large variety of studies, not a type of study itself. Different types of databases serve very different purposes, and a clear understanding of the different research designs mentioned in this paper would prevent many of the data- bases we launch from being just a lot of work and very lit- tle science.

A dataset, on the other hand, is a single table. An exam- ple of a dataset would be the data collected in a cross- sectional study, as for example, the one taken in a health survey, or in a case–control study, or just as it happens in most retrospective cohorts, when entered into a spread- sheet or directly into the statistical file. Subjects or patients have just one visit in which data are recorded; regardless the moment when the measure of interest occurred, this is on the day of the interview or in the past. even when the data are recorded with a specific date (i.e. the date when the disease was diagnosed) and thus there is a reference to time, this does not mean that data are actually recorded “over time.” the “over time” concept has a prospective sense with sequential episodes of data collection in sepa- rated time points. Sometimes, it may be convenient to introduce the data not directly into the spreadsheet, but into user-friendly screens that may lead the researcher to the impression that several levels or sets of information actually exist, while underneath all the information may be recorded in just one table. In this case, we may still have a dataset, not a database. Analysing databases Databases can be explored with a predetermined objec- tive, and the data obtained be analysed. the practical truth is that information can only be analysed statistically if presented in a table, regardless of its length. this implies that the database must be queried and the inter-related data from different tables be compiled in a table or data- set (see Fig. 1). In tables obtained from inter-related data, several records or rows may correspond to the same indi- vidual. this is what is usually referred to as a long format. You must be aware of it when doing the analysis, as many times data in different rows are interpreted as independ- ent, when they are actually related to the same patient. For some specific analyses, the statistician may need each row corresponding to a patient, or to whatever the main level of the database is, and each secondary level (visit, treatment, etc.) be identified with a numerical index (visit 1, visit 2, treatment 1, treatment 2, etc.). this is called wide format and can be obtained back and for from the long format with some statistical packages (see Fig. 1). Types of databases Basically, we could establish four types of databases in medicine, depending on their purpose: (1) administra- tive databases, (2) clinical databases, (3) registers, and (4) study-oriented databases (see Fig. 2). Administrative databases are set up with the specific purpose of managing the organizational and economic aspects of a given population. they allow assessing and previewing the need of workforce for the organisation or system, monitoring processes, allocation of resources, logistic needs, insurance monitoring, costs, etc. In some cases, variables that can be obtained from administrative databases behave as good surrogate measures for other outcomes (i.e. hospital admissions for serious events), and there are plenty of examples in the scientific literature in which these databases are used to estimate the preva- lence of certain diseases or to explore research hypothesis [2, 3]. they are mainly used when a rapid response to a clinical question is needed, but unfortunately, one must acknowledge their limitations. they are usually very com- plex and not prepared for all clinical questions, and their use implies a thorough knowledge of their structure and definitions [4]. An advantage is that they include a large numbers of persons, sick or not, which clearly increases the statistical power for questions on rare outcomes, for instance. Also, a pertinent use of these databases is to cross-check the data included in clinical databases, such as to confirm death and cause of death or work status, as well as drug consumption. Quite often, physicians record patients’ characteristic and evolution directly from their practice in an intent to monitor health care practices. the result is the establish- ment of clinical databases. these are useful to retrieve patients’ reports and individual clinical histories, and are a good way to assess the individual practice composition of a department or a clinic [5]; however, many researchers use these clinical databases to answer research questions, or even more, to explore associations. Many of these data- bases are quite complex and collect important outcome measures that may give the illusion of a real research tool. However, they may have important biases to be considered for the testing of research hypothesis. the patients included have not been selected in a random manner, which pre- cludes the use of statistical instruments for formal hypoth- esis testing. they might also pose problems with regards to how representative the sample is, which cannot be easily detected. And most important, it is very difficult to record Table 1 Database: key points Useful tool for a large variety of studies, not a type of study Organise the data, creating levels of hierarchical relationship takes into account the notion of time Source of tables for further statistical analysis 449Rheumatol Int (2014) 34:447–452 1 3 all variables with the expected quality of a main outcome variable if one does not know ahead of time what the main outcome variable will be, without a clear definition or a study protocol [6, 7]. Related challenges are selection and detection biases, missing data, associations by chance, post hoc hypotheses, etc. these are exactly the same problems that any retrospective study based on the review of clini- cal charts face, but with the delusion of a computerized database that looks more scientific. A different issue is to establish a cohort of patients with specific research objec- tives and a protocol, for which researchers collect data in the clinic with the investigative purpose [8]. Registers are sometimes confused with clinical data- bases. A true register is a system that captures new ele- ments, being these elements incident cases of a disease or incident treatments with a specific drug. the timing for introducing data in a register is not pre-planned at start; the timing depends on when a new case is identified, or a new treatment is started. Disease registers are structured around geographical areas and units, and involve the existence of active investigations to identify cases and to notify them [9, 10]. Databases from disease register permits to explore and to identify disease clusters, to generate risk and prognos- tic hypothesis and related studies, and to manage research. these registers play a very important role in the epidemio- logical research of rare and deadly diseases [11]. In a drug register, the pace of the data entry is given by the initiation of new treatments, of a target drug or therapeutic group, in patients who meet the inclusion criteria. the main purpose of such registers is the identification of adverse events not shown in randomised controlled trials and of rare long-term adverse events that may be related to certain drugs [12]. Drug registers are usually used to select patients for cohort or case–control studies. Fig. 1 A database consists of a repository of inter-related tables, as seen in the upper panel; each table being related to others by an index item or field. to analyse a database, one must retrieve tables by que- rying the database. this causes the production of tables that contain repeated items. when data are inter-related in tables, records may be repeated (long format), like in the right panel, with each register corresponding to a visit, and a patient spread over several registers. Although many clinicians tend to enter the data of the same patient in a single row (not a database), analysis is not as straightforward as in the long format. when every patient represents a single row (wide format; left panel), the information from each visit must be repre- sented by a different variable and numeral (i.e. visit1, visit2, age1, age2, drug1, drug2…) 450 Rheumatol Int (2014) 34:447–452 1 3 the databases with the largest utility to research are those study-oriented ones. Cohorts use databases in studies set up for testing specific hypotheses. Sensu stricto, cohorts are set to test aetiological hypotheses, that is, the associa- tion between exposure and outcome (e.g. disease occur- rence), but they can also be assembled to test prognosis, that is, the association between patients or environment fea- tures at the beginning of follow-up and outcome (e.g. mor- tality or poor outcome), or to test resource-use hypotheses, that is, the association between context and patients char- acteristics and resource use. Patients or subjects in a cohort must be sampled randomly to be representative [13]. the timing of the data entry is pre-established in visits or exam- inations at a given interval (periodical). Interestingly, many biologics registers in rheumatology are actually set-up like cohorts [14–16]. In this sense, registers can be called stud- ies, although they should better be called cohorts. Some terms related to cohorts may need a recall. First of all, an inception cohort is that formed from all the new— incident—cases in a given population. In some studies, inception cohort is used to refer to a sample of patients in the same stage of disease evolution that is usually at the beginning, close to diagnosis [17]. cohorts allow nested case–control studies. there are clear advantages of using a cohort for a case–control study: the controls are truly rep- resentative of the target population and have been selected at random, in the same way as the cases, allowing for valid extrapolation of results to the population it is sampled from. Open cohorts allow for permanent incorporation of new subjects, either new comers in the general population area, or new cases in a cohort of patients. Open cohorts allow the study of the simultaneous influence of calendar time, age (duration), and cohort (onset) in demography, epidemiology, and clinical follow-up, in what is called a lexis diagram [18] (see Fig. 3). the average age may remain stable over time, as young patients keep adding into the cohort. Closed cohorts are usually for a specific research objective, for which a sample size has been calculated, and recruitment is finished after a given period of time. In closed cohorts, subjects become older with follow-up. Permanent surveys are a type of cohort in which the examination of the same type of subjects over time is established in repeated cross- sectional surveys. they are actually large open cohorts, which are monitored over such a long time, that investiga- tors change as well as research questions at different point times, e.g. the Framingham Heart Study [19]. Finally, the randomised controlled trials are exactly cohorts in which the hypothesis being tested is the efficacy of a treatment or an intervention controlled by the investigator. they dif- fer from observational cohorts by the existence of a planned intervention on subjects by design. Other study designs that use study-oriented databases are called longitudinal obser- vational studies. Prognosis and resource-use studies will only be considered cohorts when the sample is selected in a random fashion and when the hypothesis is pre-established before the launch of the cohort. In the case of prognostic studies, the hypothesis would be to study the link between Fig. 2 types of databases (according to the purpose and design of the study it serves). the pyramid denotes how solid a database is. A database that has been built oriented to a specific study is usually a very solid one and easy to analyse. Registries try to build databases that are close to study-oriented databases and therefore can be solid as well, although they have many missing data and difficult analysis. clinical databases are very similar to registers, but more problem- atic (missing data, “dirty” data, unclear definitions, “biases…”). the most problematic databases are administrative databases, unless we are interested in administrative data, as the health data are usually of unclear quality Fig. 3 A typical lexis diagram representing an open cohort. each individual is represented by a 45° line. Participants enter the study at different time points (T calendar time), usually when they become incident cases. then, they are followed up until they either have an event or until they are lost to follow-up, die, during a period of time (A time in study) that may differ from participant to participant 451Rheumatol Int (2014) 34:447–452 1 3 the exposure and potential prognostic factors (i.e. determi- nants) and the rate of occurrence of a given outcome. In the second case, the rate of use of a given resource or a hypo- thetical cost during a specified time is the focus of interest for description and determinants seeking. Finally, another type of databases are repositories. Repositories are databases that keep patients’ samples, data, or any material, including studies, or research instru- ments, that can be further used for research by doing the proper queries and linking them to more elaborated data. Databases are not studies Databases whose objective is merely to collect data are use- less. those who work in clinical research units supporting the research in clinical centres all can recall of colleagues who come to them with datasets and who want them to build a clinical question and a study for their data [20]. It is their discouraging duty to explain that clinical databases are a clinical tool, as well as computerised medical records are, not studies. Studies start with a research question and then build on a protocol to refute the question; databases are not always created on these grounds, only the study-ori- ented ones. Keeping track of your patients is not the same as running a study. Nevertheless, an acceptable use of many databases would be to identify patients with a given charac- teristic, to use them to draw a random sample, and to test a research hypothesis prospectively, but always bear in mind, the selection bias inherent to any sample drawn from a clini- cal database, limiting the validity of the results obtained [21]. Another fruitful use of a database is the possibility to select incident or prevalent cases for a specific study, and also con- trols, by filtering the patients by specific characteristics or selection criteria. when doing this, we should bear in mind that there may be considerable diagnostic errors and that we may need a secondary validation of selection criteria. In brief, we should bear in mind the meaning and use of databases. As it has been highlighted, a database is a useful tool for a large variety of studies, not a type of study itself. Different types of databases serve very different purposes, and a clear understanding of the different research designs mentioned in this paper would prevent many of the data- bases we launch from being just a lot of work and very lit- tle science.
