MTPs describe an empirical treatment that optimizes management of resuscitation and correction of coagulopathy arising from severe haemorrhage. In adults, several definitions of MT exist based on the volume of the blood products transfused and also the time frames over which these transfusions occurred.”” The three most common definitions of MT in adult patients are: \" i transfusion of =10 red blood cell (RBC) units, which approximates the total blood volume (TBV) (Table 1) of an average adult patient, within 24 h, ii. transfusion of >4 RBC units in 1 h with anticipation of continued need for blood product support, and iii. replacement of >50% of the TBV by blood products within 3 h.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
