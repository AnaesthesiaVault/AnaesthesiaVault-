Correct bronchus: clamp the tracheal lumen and ventilate through the bronchial lumen. The left lung should ventilate. If the right lung ventilates, the DLT has advanced into the right main bronchus. Correct depth: clamp the bronchial lumen and ventilate through the tracheal lumen. The right lung should ventilate independently and easily. If ventilation of the right lung is met with increased airway resistance, the tube may have advanced too far, such that the orifice of the tracheal lumen is obstructed by the wall of the left main bronchus. If both lungs ventilate, the tube has most likely not been advanced far enough into the left main bronchus. A leak suggests that the tube is not correctly positioned or that the cuffs are not sufficiently inflated. Bronchoscopy: advance the bronchoscope to the tip of the tracheal lumen. The carina should be seen in the centre of the screen and the trachealis muscle identified posteriorly, at the bottom of the screen. The left main bronchus should be seen on the left of the screen with a rim of (blue) bronchial cuff visible. The right main bronchus should be seen on the right of the screen. Advance the bronchoscope into the right main bronchus. The origin of the right upper lobe bronchus should come into view on the top right of the screen. Advance the bronchoscope into the right upper lobe bronchus to identify the three sub-segmental bronchi. UL, upper lobe.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
