The goal is provide the minimum necessary achieve the goal. See also Nasal Oxygen + Ingeneral, the goal Sp02 should be 34% in most people, or 88-92% in people at risk for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Delivery OnePager « The amount of oxygen delivered is approximate and can depend on many factors: « Patient’s inspiratory effort (faster inspiratory flow will entrain more ambient air) * Face seal (looser seal will entrain more ambient air) « Note that higher flow rates can rapidly deplete portable 2 tanks.
