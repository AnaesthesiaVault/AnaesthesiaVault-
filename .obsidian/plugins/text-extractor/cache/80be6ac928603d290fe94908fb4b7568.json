Management of patients treated with VKA for atrial fibrillation requiring invasive procedures. Adapted with permission from [3]. The management of VKA and decision to use bridging therapy in patients with afrial fibrillation involves weighing the risk of thromboembolism against the risk of surgical bleeding. Many superficial surgeries, such as cataract procedures, may be performed without interrupting VKA therapy. If the patient is deemed to be at low thromboembolic risk, VKA may be stopped without bridging therapy. If the patient is deemed to be at moderate or high risk of thromboembolism, then bridging therapy with LMWH is usually employed. When a patient on VKA therapy requires emergency surgery with high bleeding risk, vitamin K or PCC concentrate may be given. * Low thromboembolic risk: patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and CHADS, (or CHA,DS,-VASc) score <2 (threshold not validated by prospective studies). “*Moderate or high thromboembolic risk: valvular atrial fibrillation, recent stroke or transient ischemic attack, CHA,DS»-VASc >3. ** Unfractionated heparin remains used in some very high-risk patients or in patients with severe renal failure. DVT, deep venous thrombosis; INR, international normalized ratio; LMWH, low molecular weight heparin; PCC, prothrombin complex concentrate; VKA, vitamin K antagonist.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
