The estimated blood loss is 20-45% of the aspirated volume Wet technique Regardless of the amount aspirated, 200-300ml of wetting solution is injected per areas to be treated. Blood loss is approximately 4-30% of the aspirate volume Super wet technique The amount of fluid is injected (1ml per estimated ml of expected aspirate) is equal to the amount of fat to be removed. Blood loss is approximately 1% of the aspirated volume Tumescent technique Large volume of fluid (3-4ml estimated ml of expected aspirate) is injected into the fat, raising the concerned areas to become turgid and firm. Blood loss is approximately 1% of the aspirate volume Source: Indian Journal of Anaesthesia. 2011 May-Jun; 55(3):221","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
