Dennis Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Women’s Hospital, Parkville, Australia ABSTRACT Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a powerful non-invasive diagnostic, monitoring and measurement device in medicine. In addition to cardiologists, many other specialised groups, including emergency and critical care physicians and cardiac anaesthe- tists, have recognised its ability to provide high quality information and utilise TTE in the care of their patients. In obstetric anaes- thesia and management of obstetric critical illness, the favourable characteristics of pregnant women facilitate TTE examination. These include anterior and left lateral displacement of the heart, frequent employment of the left lateral tilted position to avoid aortocaval compression, spontaneous ventilation and wide acceptance of ultrasound technology by women. Of relevance to obstet- ric anaesthetists is that maternal morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease is signiﬁcant worldwide. This makes TTE an appropriate, important and applicable device in pregnant women. Clinician-performed TTE enables differentiation between the life-threatening causes of hypotension. In the critically ill woman this improves diagnostic accuracy and allows treatment interven- tions to be instituted and monitored at the point of patient care. This article outlines the application of TTE in the specialty of obstetric anaesthesia and in the management of obstetric critical illness. It describes the importance of TTE education, quality assurance and outcome recording. It also discusses how barriers to the routine implementation of TTE in obstetric anaesthesia and management of obstetric critical illness can be overcome. \u0002c 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In obstetric anaesthesia and management of obstetric critical illness it has the ability to reshape our understanding of the cardiovascular system and management strategies, although in this context it is an emerging technology. The ability of TTE to not only pro- vide volumetric and ﬂow data but also to actually show the functioning heart with advanced two- and three- dimensional graphical images makes TTE a powerful tool.1,2 These advantages have been recognised by other specialty groups, including emergency physicians, 3 and intensive care clinicians,4–10 who use this technology in their daily practice. Cardiac anaesthetists have been utilising transoesophageal echocardiography for many decades. The use of transthoracic rather than transo- esophageal echocardiography, by non-cardiac anaesthe- tists, is increasing. Currently there is a particular emphasis on the use of TTE for perioperative manage- ment.1,11–14 Transthoracic echocardiography Advances in device portability, ease of use, connectivity and data storage in combination with reduced size, weight and increased durability and battery life, now enable TTE to be used in a range of clinical settings. In addition, the frequent absence of a 24-h immediate TTE service has necessitated the upskilling of many clinician groups involved in the acute setting when the advantages of TTE can be seen at the bedside.15 Signif- icant advances in image quality and reproducibility have enabled TTE to be immediately applied in the crit- ical care and emergency setting.6,8 TTE may be used for obstetric applications in routine locations such as the birthing suite, emergency department, operating the- atre, postanaesthetic care unit and intensive care unit as well as in patient transport vehicles, and in remote and rural settings. These monitors provide qualitative and quantitative data comprising left and right ventric- ular systolic and diastolic function, ventricular ﬁlling and contractility information (Table 1).16,17 One of Accepted November 2010 Correspondence to: Dr Alicia Dennis, MBBS PhD PGDip Echo, FANZCA, Director of Anaesthesia Research, The Royal Women’s Hospital, Parkville, Australia.

TTE utilises the properties of inaudible (ultrasound) sound waves as a form of kinetic energy to determine the structure and function of the heart and great vessels. Ultrasound machines used for other applications such as obstetric and fetal assessment, vascular access and regional anaesthesia techniques, 18–20 are frequently able to have interchangeable probes to enable TTE examination. The device measures and records distances and times as the fundamental units and this enables calculations such as area, velocity, and ﬂow. Other fundamental properties of sound waves are employed such as the Doppler shift enabling velocity to be calculated.21 How- ever, pressure within the heart is not directly measured; the relationship between pressure and velocity is de- scribed by the modiﬁed Bernoulli equation, in which the pressure gradient is approximated to four times the square of the velocity.22 As invasive monitoring devices are rarely used as research tools or in clinical practice due to their risks,23 Doppler echocardiography, as an alternative, has been compared with invasive devices such as cardiac catheterisation for estimating pulmonary artery pressure, left atrial pressure and left ventricular Table 1 Capabilities of echocardiography in the adult Transthoracic echocardiography M mode Two dimensional imaging Spectral (pulse wave and continuous) Doppler Tissue Doppler Colour Doppler Structural Chamber size ++++ ++++ – – – Wall thickness ++++ +++ – – – Relation of chambers + ++++ – – – Early closure of MV ++++ + – – – Systolic anterior motion of MV ++++ +++ – – – LV mass ++++ ++++ – – – LV masses (tumour, clot, vegetation) + +++ – – – Masses in atria and right ventricle +++ – – – Anatomic valvular pathology ++ ++++ – – – Septal defects + ++++ ++ – ++++ Pericardial eﬀusion ++ ++++ – – – Functional Global LV systolic function ++ ++++ ++ ++ – Regional wall motion + +++ – – – Severity of valve stenosis + ++ ++++ – +++ Severity of valve regurgitation + + +++ – +++ Site of right to left, left to right shunt – +++ Together +++ – ++++ Together RV and PA systolic pressure – – ++++ – – LV ﬁlling pressure – – ++ +++ With LV inﬂow – Stroke volume and cardiac output +++ Together ++ +++ Together – – LV diastolic function + + +++ +++ – Identify ischaemia and viable myocardium with exercise or pharmacological stress – +++ – + – Diseases of the aorta – ++ – – ++ Prosthetic valve evaluation – ++ ++++ – +++ ‘‘++++’’ Indicated most useful; ‘‘+’’ least useful; ‘‘–’’ not useful.LV left ventricular; MV mitral valve; RV right ventricular; PA pulmonary artery.; Adapted from Cheitlin, et al. 16,26 A.T.

It has also been compared to other techniques for determining car- diac output and stroke volume including thermodilu- tion, electromagnetic and roller pump methods and has been found to be accurate. 24 There are recommendations about both the appropri- ateness of the use of echocardiography in clinical cir- cumstances and its use in research.6,16,25,26 There are published guidelines about how to perform calculations and measurements using echocardiography in order to create uniformity, precision, accuracy and maintain quality of studies, and also the important issues of de- vice safety, bioeffects and cleaning and infection con- trol.2,6,16,24–38 Transthoracic echocardiography and pregnant women The pregnant woman has unique characteristics which facilitate TTE examination (see Supplementary mate- rial). Anterior and left displacement of the heart com- bined with an elevated diaphragm and partial left lateral tilt means that the pregnant woman is the ideal subject for parasternal and apical TTE views. In the intraoperative setting with no sedation, spontaneous ventilation, left lateral tilt and thoracic sensory blockade with neuraxial anaesthesia, the TTE examination is sensation-free with minimum lung interference. Most pregnant women are accepting of, and knowledgeable about, ultrasound. Ultrasound has an excellent safety proﬁle, is non-invasive and fetal ultrasound is routinely used in pregnancy and birth. 20 As many acute obstetric critical illnesses occur on the background of normal physiology, pregnant women can act as their own healthy reference if a routine TTE is performed during pregnancy or preoperatively. Importantly, many vali- dated parameters for determining systolic and diastolic function, such as fractional shortening and mitral valve inﬂow velocities have been performed in spontaneously breathing people.24 This enables translation to the preg- nant population, many of whom will undergo neuraxial anaesthesia and analgesia with no sedation whilst spon- taneously breathing. Furthermore, TTE is a standard investigation, monitoring and measuring device in other areas of medicine for a range of cardiac conditions and as cardiac disease is now the leading cause of maternal mor- tality in high infrastructure countries,39 investigation and the integration of TTE into obstetric anaesthesia and management of obstetric critical illness seems a logical extension of common practice. In the non-acute setting, serial assessment of the cardiovascular system using a standardised repeatable transthoracic echocardiographic examination throughout pregnancy is commonly used by physicians involved in managing pregnant women with cardiac conditions. Traditionally, cardiovascular monitoring in obstetric anaesthesia and management of obstetric critical illness ranges from non-invasive techniques (clinical assessment using simple observations, blood pressure assessment, heart rate monitoring, electrocardiography, respiratory rate, temperature, pulse oximetry, urine output) and minimally invasive techniques (intra-arterial blood pres- sure measurement, minimally-invasive cardiac output assessment) to highly invasive techniques (central venous pressure measurements using a central venous catheter or pulmonary artery catheter, and transoesoph- ageal echocardiography). Except in the situation of crit- ically ill women, the use of invasive devices is uncommon in current clinical practice due to the high risks associated with their use (bleeding, perforation, and infection, death). Transoesophageal echocardio- graphy is rarely the ﬁrst-line measurement device in the critically ill conscious pregnant woman. It frequently requires tracheal intubation and airway protection with advanced gestation and has known signiﬁcant side effects.8 Newer devices such as suprasternal Doppler cardiac output assessment devices speciﬁcally utilise the principles of Doppler cardiac output assessment. As such, they provide information about cardiac output without additional two dimensional, diastolic or struc- tural information that is obtained with full capability TTE. The combination of TTE with intra-arterial blood pressure measurement and arterial blood gas sampling allows information regarding cardiac, respiratory and metabolic status to be obtained and offers signiﬁcant advantages. Other authors have summarised the advan- tages and disadvantages of these invasive, minimally and non-invasive monitors in the setting of pregnancy, obstetric anaesthesia and in the non-pregnant popula- tion.40–44 Most of these measurement devices are described in comparison to TTE, as TTE is frequently regarded as the reference standard for cardiovascular system diagno- sis, monitoring and research purposes. It provides infor- mation not only about cardiac output, but also about other parameters of systolic function, and diastolic, structural and functional information. Doppler echocar- diography has been validated against other methods of determining cardiac output such as Fick, dye dilution, thermodilution and electromagnetic ﬂow probe tech- niques and has been found to be reproducible and accu- rate.45 Validity studies of cardiac output have been performed in pregnancy comparing thermodilution and dye dilution with Doppler echocardiography, and Doppler echocardiography has been found to be an acceptable measurement of cardiac output in preg- nancy.46–50 Its main disadvantage is operator depen- dence and the additional training that is required to perform the technique accurately. Technical and diag- nostic errors may be overcome by precise training in the technique, accurate patient positioning, and uniform 162 Transthoracic echocardiography measurements with optimal images. In the clinical set- ting it is not a continuous monitoring technique but rather provides diagnostic snapshots at discrete time intervals. In pregnancy, subcostal views may be difﬁcult and interpretation of non-acute and subtle changes in structure and function need to be interpreted with cau- tion, as modiﬁcations to both systolic and diastolic func- tion and structure occur in the normal healthy pregnant woman.51,52 Obstetric critical illness Obstetric critical illness is severe organ system derange- ment in a pregnant or recently pregnant woman, result- ing, or likely to result, in severe morbidity or mortality. The central role of the anaesthetist in managing these women as part of a multiprofessional team is empha- sised in many recent publications. 39,53–55 Traditionally, extreme perturbations of organ dysfunction in obstetric critical illness have occurred on a background of previ- ous excellent health and large physiological reserve. However modern maternal characteristics including morbid obesity, congenital and acquired cardiac disease, increasing age, assisted reproduction and obstetric haemorrhage related to adherent placental tissue mean that diagnostic dilemmas may occur leading to clinical uncertainty (Table 2). The use of echocardiography for the evaluation of hypotension, shock or haemodynamic instability of uncertain or suspected cardiac aetiology, meets the high- est level of appropriateness or Class 1 recommendations according to American, British and European Guide- lines.6,16,25,26,56,57 Other Class 1 indications include assessment of critically injured patients who have sus- tained blunt or penetrating chest trauma or suspected aortic injury evidenced by a widening of the mediasti- num. Use of emergency echocardiography is highly appropriate to evaluate and guide therapy in patients with chest pain, respiratory failure of suspected cardiac aetiology and haemodynamic instability with known or suspected acute pulmonary embolism.16,26,58 The useful- ness of TTE for determining the underlining cause of hypotension and guiding or modifying8,30 therapy in the critically ill adult (cardiac tamponade, sepsis with vasodilation, acute valvular dysfunction, acute myocar- dial ischaemia, right heart overload and dysfunction, hypovolaemia and systolic and/or diastolic heart failure) has led groups to consider the incorporation of emer- gency bedside TTE into adult advanced life support pro- tocols. 59 This is not surprising as assessment with TTE to diagnose and guide therapy has been a routine part of the standard management of patients with suspected cardiac failure in the general population for many years.60,61 All of these conditions are common in obstet- ric critical illness. There are many case reports highlight- ing the usefulness of TTE in the obstetric setting.62–64 Many groups have investigated cardiac function using TTE in pregnancy47,51,65 and described techniques for assessing cardiovascular parameters in critically-ill obstetric patients.66 In addition the TTE probe can be used in the obstetric setting to evaluate fetal heart rate. TTE is used in other critical care areas,6 with examples being the focused assessment with sonography for trau- ma (FAST) for detection of free intra-abdominal ﬂuid, the bedside limited echocardiography by the emergency physician (BLEEP) in emergency medicine, the focus as- sessed transthoracic echocardiography (FATE) for car- diopulmonary monitoring in intensive care67 and the haemodynamic echocardiographic assessment in real time (HART) scan.13,15,68,69 In the area of obstetric anaesthesia and obstetric crit- ical illness, deﬁning the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of TTE for various obstetric conditions, comparisons with other devices and correlation of acute changes with other Table 2 Clinical scenarios in obstetric critical illness Clinical scenarios Obstetric critical illness Major obstetric haemorrhage Myocardial ischaemia Cardiac failure Sepsis Embolism – pulmonary, amniotic ﬂuid, air Preeclampsia Coagulopathy Aortic dissection Respiratory emergencies (asthma) Endocrine emergencies Extreme obesity Trauma Clinical symptoms and signs Bleeding Unexplained tachycardia Hypotension Chest pain Shortness of breath Severe hypertension Fever Reduced conscious state Collapse Clinical questions addressed with the use of TTE What is the intravenous volume status?

Dennis 163 diagnostic tests including biomarkers is still required be- fore accurate inferences can be made about subtle TTE ﬁndings in this population. However, like the above abbreviated examinations, in other areas of medicine there is a parallel need for a screening examination that is designed speciﬁcally for a pregnant woman to detect gross abnormalities and which focuses on a rapid two dimensional qualitative screening examination of cardiac function in the emergency critical illness situation. Work by our group has demonstrated that TTE is acceptable to women and applicable in the obstetric population and is able to be used in both research studies and as a rapidly performed bedside scan to assist with diagnosis and for assessing response to treatment (the rapid obstetric screening echocardiography (ROSE) scan).51,70–72 In 152 pregnant women, test completion with key haemodynamic and diagnostic data was obtainable in 97% (147 women) despite widely varying gestations (24–43 weeks) and body habitus (body mass index 20– 56 kg/m2) and was within 5–10% when measured by different observers. TTE was used in obese women and image quality was found to be minimally affected by this body habitus. a These data are consistent with reports from other groups where the rate of success of acquiring images and haemodynamic data in non- pregnant patients ranged from 91 – 99%.4,8,12 A detailed worked example of an abbreviated examination on a healthy pregnant woman is given in Appendix A. The principles of the ROSE scan are: (1) Acceptable and applicable. (2) Bedside test at left hand side of the woman. (3) Comfortable and concise examination – paraster- nal views, apical views. (4) Diagnosis and response to therapy – contractility status and volume status. (5) Embolism (air, blood, amniotic ﬂuid) – right heart function/relative size. (6) Fetal heart rate assessment. These abbreviated techniques can be taught to and performed by clinicians and could also be taught to para- medical staff.73 Importantly, these examinations do not replace the formal quantitative TTE examinations which can still be performed in an elective setting at a later time. As obstetric anaesthetists, the addition of this appropri- ate technology to our skill set and ensuring that TTE equipment is readily available in our departments en- ables a rapid and focused TTE examination in the setting of unpredictable and life-threatening emergencies. This would be advantageous to our patients and consistent with the other professional groups involved in the man- agement of critically ill patients.53,66,74,75 Transthoracic echocardiography education Whilst formalised TTE education exists for training and accreditation in cardiology and ultrasonography and some areas of anaesthesia and critical care medicine including cardiac anaesthesia, TTE training and accredi- tation for other groups is less well deﬁned internation- ally.30,76,77 There are a wide variety of courses and training workshops with many groups developing curric- ula for TTE training.3,15,68,69,76–78 Attempts at coordinat- ing curricula and deﬁning competencies77 and recording a comprehensive minimum dataset for standard TTE examination,30 especially in the area of critical care med- icine, are well advanced and will continue to be reﬁned over the forthcoming years.30 Most groups recognise the need to achieve basic or novice level training in the acute recognition of life - threatening clinical conditions. This includes the use of TTE in the cardiac arrest situa- tion. This is followed, in a stepwise manner, by increasing knowledge, skills and clinical experiences, to the level of expert.6,30,77 Whilst a novice should be expected to be able to differentiate between hypotension caused by either cardiogenic shock in the peripartum period, signiﬁcant hypovolaemia, right ventricular failure or cardiac tam- ponade, situations other than these require an increased level of knowledge. An advanced or expert practitioner is able to perform full cardiac assessment. This includes determining whether the heart is preload-sensitive and quantifying responses to ﬂuid challenges or ﬂuid removal which may occur in the complex case of diastolic failure where intravascular volume assessment is required in women with severe preeclampsia.30,72,77,79 Quality assurance and outcome recording The application of this technology without appropriate education, training, practical experience and outcome recording has the potential to cause harm.3,16,26 Funda- mental, therefore, to the implementation of TTE in to routine practice in obstetric anaesthesia and obstetric critical care, is the requirement for quality assurance and outcome recording including appropriate storage, reporting and documentation of examination, at all levels.3,30,57,77,80,81 The American Society of Echocardio- graphy has suggested hierarchical levels for the evalua- tion of echocardiography in clinical practice which include technical capacity, diagnostic performance, im- pact on diagnostic and prognostic thinking, therapeutic impact and health-related outcomes.80 The Cochrane Collaboration have a dedicated diagnostic test accuracy working group and an editorial body speciﬁcally exam- ining the evolving issues relating to diagnostic test accu- racy study design.82–84 a Dennis A, Simmons S, Carr C, Permezel M. Rapid obstetric screening echocardiography. Abstract presented at the Society of Obstetric Anesthesiologists and Perinatologists (SOAP) Annual Meet- ing; May 2010. 164 Transthoracic echocardiography Currently the literature on TTE in emergency medi- cine, critical care and anaesthesia is focused on technical capacity, applicability and acceptability, with some studies measuring impact on diagnostic and prognostic thinking. Future studies need to incorporate therapeutic impact and health-related outcomes as well as speciﬁc measurement data with both inter - and intraobserver variability recorded. Overcoming barriers to implementation Access to equipment and the capital cost of the equip- ment have limited widespread implementation of TTE. Increasing awareness of TTE and its applicability and acceptability by pregnant women in obstetric anaesthe- sia and management of obstetric critical illness is the ﬁrst step towards addressing this. Concurrently report- ing the use of TTE in this area and documentation of beneﬁts will enable an evidence base from which rational arguments can be made by obstetric anaesthetic depart- ments to acquire these devices. Ongoing education and curriculum development in TTE in obstetric critical ill- ness, practical training and hands-on workshops involv- ing pregnant women are needed to increase the skill level and allow most clinicians to reach the level of a basic or novice practitioner.30 Most importantly, for quality assurance, collaborative structured recording of data and review of TTE images and measurements needs to occur to ensure precision and maintenance of stan- dards.57 This is in conjunction with the collection of sim- ple data sets recording key impact and outcome measures. With the wide use of telemedicine and internet resources, collaboration and developments of this nat- ure are possible. Finally further research involving preg- nant woman utilising this non-invasive technology in the area of obstetric anaesthesia and obstetric critical illness research will enable establishment of reference ranges for TTE measurement in pregnancy, and a greater understanding of the pathophysiological changes that occur in the acute emergency setting.85 With reference ranges for some echocardiographic measurements in pregnancy now starting to be reported and in the future their incorporation into standard echocardiography textbooks, there should be a much wider application of TTE in this population group. The future As doctors we pursue a lifelong educational journey. We also undertake precise and detailed clinical observations of the people who entrust their lives to us. In these areas TTE presents opportunities to increase our knowledge and observations in pregnant women. TTE can provide a large and positive impact in critically ill pregnant women. This is because of their favourable scanning characteristics and their widespread acceptance of ultra- sound. Therefore, like emergency physicians, critical care physicians and other groups of anaesthetists, obstetric anaesthetists and our trainees, should embrace this technology.
