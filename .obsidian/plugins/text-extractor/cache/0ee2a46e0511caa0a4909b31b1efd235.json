Strain = tidal volume / functional residual capacity Increasing the tidal volume will increase strain and increase the destructive forces on the lung parenchyma, a reduction in FRC is similarly injurious. Thus, ventilatory strategies which aim to reduce the tidal volume and increase the FRC (e.g. using PEEP) will reduce the strain applied to the lung. Simply put: changes in transpulmonary pressure (stress) relate to barotrauma, changes in tidal volume and FRC (strain) relate to volutrauma. The lung protective strategy of ventilation tries to improve the homogeneity across the lung, which should minimise the energy dissipated across the lung, and therefore reduce stress, strain and injury. The concept of power {measured in Joules/min) has recently been introduced into VILI pathophysiology; its basis stems from the concept that the magnitude of energy transferred from the ventilator into the lung may contribute to VILI. A threshold of 12)/min appears to be the cut off, above which VILI occurs and the probability of survival decreases. However, 1 think this is rather complex for daily use in the clinical arena as the formula is cumbersome, although this is an attractive concept and will be useful when ventilator software computes this automatically! How to do no harm Four techniques have emerged in the literature on lung-protective ventilatory strategies in patients with ARDS {ARDSnet Investigators 2000): 1. Llimit tidal volumes (V5) 2. Limit plateau pressures (P} 3. Use of high(er) positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 4. Use of recruitment manoeuvres (RM)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
