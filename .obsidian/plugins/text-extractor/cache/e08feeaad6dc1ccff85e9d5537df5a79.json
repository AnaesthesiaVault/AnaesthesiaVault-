Activation of the autonomic nervous sys- tem below the level of the lesion results in a profound sympathet- ic response up to the level of injury. If the level is above T6, the splanchnic circulation becomes in- volved resulting in splanchnic vasoconstriction, and hence, a greater severity of symptoms. Compensatory mechanisms aiming to reduce the hypertension, via parasympathetic activity, are acti- vated up to the level of the lesion. This results in the characteristic symptoms of bradycardia and vasodilation above the lesion. Stimuli arise from caudal roots below the level of the lesion, with ~80% of patients being because of bladder distension.* Other triggers include bowel distension, acute abdominal path- ology, urinary tract infections, skeletal fractures, pressure ulcers, activation of pain fibres, sexual activity, and uterine contractions.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
