Myocardial disease: Previous myocardial infarction and/or ongoing angina. Cerebrovascular disease: includes all grades of stroke including transient ischaemic attack. Renal disease: serum urea > 20 mmol/l and/or creatinine of > 150 mmol/l. The best cut-off value for GAS in emergency repair is 84 indicating a mortality of 65%.” Hardman index: 1 point is assigned for each preoperative variable present, so the possible score ranges from 0—5. A total score of > 2 is consistent with a mortality rate of > 80%.°","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
