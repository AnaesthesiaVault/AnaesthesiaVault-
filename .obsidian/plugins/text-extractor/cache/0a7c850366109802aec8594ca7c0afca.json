This may account for different responses to the use of corticosteroids in previous studies Inhaled vasodilators®// Nitric oxide has vasodilatory effects on pulmonary vasculature, and improves arterial oxygenation, but ts use has not demonstrated mortality or significant outcome benefits.Its use is complicated by high costs and increased renal dysfunction Muscle relaxants™7 Short-term use of muscle relaxation (up to 48 h) for patients with severe ARDS may reduce mortality risk and reduce ventilator-associated lung injury. This may be mediated by reducing transpulmonary pressures during mechanical ventilation and reducing oxygen consumption, but this strategy requires further investigation ECMO® ECMO has shown promising results in uncontrolled reports of ts se in the management of severe ARDS. The role of this expensive therapy in ARDS treatment and in the transport of those with severe ARDS requires further investigation Aspirin® Aspirin may have positive effects on platelets that play an active role in the development of ARDS. The Lung Injury Prevention Study with Aspirin, a phase l tria, did not show any outcome benefit Aerosolised beta-2-agonists These agents have previously been effective in reducing pulmonary oedema by stimulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent alveolar fluid clearance. Inital studies demonstrated harm in patients with ARDS.* * However, a recent study showed favourable results with inhaled budesonide and formoterol. Patients had improved oxygenation, lower rates of acute respiratory failure and ARDS.* This therapy appears promising Keratinocyte growth factor and mesenchymal stem cells Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is expressed by mesenchymal cells and appears to promote cell repair via several mechanisms including stimulating type-2 pneumocyte development, increased surfactant production, DNA repair, and improved alveolar fluid clearance. ¥ The effects of KGF may explain the possible benefits of mesenchymal stem cells in ARDS. Researchers are currently investigating the role of intravenous KGF in patients with ARDS, and the immunomodulating role of mesenchymal stem cells*® Surfactant Surfactant inhibition and degradation is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of ARDS. Although successful in neonates and infants, multiple large trials in adults failed to show improved clinical out- comes, despite reports of transient improvements in oxygenation and lung function. There is a continued search for a better exogenous surfactant replacement therapy Beta-blockers The theoretical benefit of beta-blockers in ARDS involves suppression of the overstimulated sympathetic response that may negatively affect pulmonary vasculature.”! Some benefit has been demonstrated ina porcine endotoxin shock model; however, further RCTs are required to understand benefit” Notes: ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome, ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, DNA = deoxyribonucleic acid.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
