{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240128015133.png","text":"APPENDIX 1. (Continued). Recommendations and Best Practice Statements Remarks: If initiated, dosing should be titrated to an end point reflecting perfusion, and the agent reduced or discontinued in the face of worsening hypotension or arrhythmias. 6. We suggest that all patients requiring vasopressors have an arterial catheter placed as soon as practical if resources are available (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). H. CORTICOSTEROIDS 1. We suggest against using IV hydrocortisone to treat septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stabiliy. If this is not achievable, we suggest IV hydrocortisone at a dose of 200mg per day (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). 1. BLOOD PRODUCTS 1. We recommend that RBC transfusion occur only when hemoglobin concentration decreases to < 70g/dL in adults in the absence of extenuating circumstances, such as myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, or acute hemorrhage (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). 2. We recommend against the use of erythropoietin for treatment of anemia associated with sepsis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 3. We suggest against the use of fresh frozen plasma to correct clotting abnormalities in the absence of bleeding or planned invasive procedures (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). 4.We suggest prophylactic platelet transfusion when counts are < 10,000/mm? (10 10%/L) in the absence of apparent bleeding and when counts are < 20,000/mm? (20 x 10%L) if the patient has a significant risk of bleeding. Higher platelet counts (> 50,000/mm? [50 x 109/L]) are advised for active bleeding, surgery, or invasive procedures (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). J.IMMUNOGLOBULINS 1. We suggest against the use of IV immunoglobulins in patients with sepsis or septic shock (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). K. BLOOD PURIFICATION 1. We make no recommendation regarding the use of blood purification techniques. L. ANTICOAGULANTS 1. We recommend against the use of antithrombin for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 2. We make no recommendation regarding the use of thrombomodulin or heparin for the treatment of sepsis or septic shock.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
