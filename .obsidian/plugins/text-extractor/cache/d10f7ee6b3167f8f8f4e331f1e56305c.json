The primary operator should have a direct line of sight of the patient, video monitor and patient monitor, as well asimmediate access to infusion pumps, anaesthetic machine, suction and oxygen delivery device. If a second anaesthetist is present, they should be positioned with a direct line of sight of the patient and have immediate access to infusion pumps, as well as be able to access all other equipment. The anaesthetic assistant's primary position should be with immediate access to the airway trolley, and in proximity to the operator. (a) Awake tracheal intubation performed with the operator positioned facing the patient who is in a sitting up position. (b) Awake tracheal intubation performed with the operator positioned behind the supine/semi-recumbent patient.
