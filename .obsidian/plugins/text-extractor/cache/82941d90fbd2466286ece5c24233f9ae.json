We aimed to quantify the reliability of captured cases; hence, the primary outcome of this validation study was to establish the proportion of the total number of general anaesthetics (GAs) performed, which were captured in the registry. We therefore compared the first 200 patients in the registry with the number of theatre logbook entries for the corresponding period. The secondary outcome was a detailed description of our obstetric anaesthesia population requiring GA, including predictors of difficult airway management, and outcomes. The aim of this ongoing registry is to address the lack of data in our context, identify trends, and provide the basis for future quality improvement projects in airway management. Method A multicentre Obstetric Airway Management Registry (ObAMR) was established after approval by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of the Health Sciences Faculty of the University of Cape Town (UCT) (HREC Ref: R025/2018). The ongoing registry was approved for a duration of three years from 26 September 2018 to 30 September 2021. Perioperative data describing patient demographics, indications for GA, factors predictive of a Background: In Africa, maternal mortality after caesarean delivery is 50 times greater than in high-income countries. In South Africa, more than 50% of anaesthesia-related maternal mortality is attributed to failure to protect the airway. We implemented an obstetric airway management registry, to facilitate future improvements in management and outcomes. Methods: A prospective electronic registry was established at three obstetric sites in Cape Town, recording airway management for all general anaesthetics from 20 weeks gestation to seven days post-partum. Perioperative descriptive data are entered using a web-based smartphone-enabled platform. To quantify the reliability of capture, we compared the first 200 records in the registry to theatre logbooks. We used summary statistics to describe our obstetric anaesthesia population, and details relevant to airway management. Results: The first 200 cases were recorded from September 2018 to January 2019. According to theatre logbooks, this represented 80% of cases performed. Major indications for general anaesthesia included severe fetal distress/bradycardia (21%), failed neuraxial technique (19%), coagulopathy (19%), and abnormal placentation (12%). A third of patients had hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and 6% had imminent/confirmed eclampsia. Forty per cent were in active labour. On airway assessment, Mallampati grade was 3 or 4 in 29% of patients, and mouth opening, thyromental distance and mandibular protrusion limited in 10%, 8% and 8% respectively. Cormack-Lehane grade IIb and III views were encountered in 6% and 2% respectively, with no grade IV views. Desaturation below 90% occurred in 12% of patients. There were two cases (1%) of failed intubation with supraglottic airway rescue, and no emergency surgical airways performed. Conclusion: An obstetric airway management registry was successfully implemented. Clinically significant hypoxaemia occurred commonly during general anaesthesia, with a high incidence of difficult intubation predictors and desaturation. The registry will guide research aimed at improving safety during general anaesthesia in obstetrics.

All patients requiring GA after 20 weeks gestation and up to seven days post-delivery are included. Simple verbal consent for inclusion in the registry was approved by HREC. Preoxygenation to an end-tidal oxygen fraction > 0.8, followed by rapid sequence induction (RSI) and tracheal intubation with cricoid pressure is taught as standard practice at our centres. 4,13-16 However, the GA technique provided is ultimately at the discretion of the anaesthesiologist. All anaesthesia providers from the Department of Anaesthesia and Perioperative Medicine of UCT can enter data into the registry. Records are collected anonymously on REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, https://www.project-redcap. org/) during or immediately after the case by using an electronic link sent to their smartphones (www.tinyurl.com/ObAMR), or by scanning a QR code present in all obstetric theatres. The ObAMR is maintained on a secure password protected UCT server. Each electronic data capturing form is assigned a unique study number, with no personal identifying information. The HREC of the Health Sciences Faculty of UCT approved the validation and initial description of the first 200 cases entered into the ObAMR (UCT HREC Ref: 341/2019). Data were collected from 26 September 2018 to 9 January 2019. Data were extracted from the REDCap server to an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA). The primary outcome was assessed by establishing the proportion of general anaesthetics captured, by comparing the number of records in the registry and the total number of cases entered in the operating theatre logbooks over the same time period. For secondary outcomes, baseline patient characteristics were reported as mean (standard deviation [SD]) for continuous normally distributed variables, median (interquartile range [IQR]) for data not normally distributed, and number (percentage) for categorical variables. In addition, details relating to airway management were reported, includ- ing experience of anaesthesia provider, airway assessment, laryngoscopic view, and outcomes such as incidence of failed intubation and rescue, and nadir of oxygen saturation (< 90% defined as clinically significant). The detailed data capture sheet is available as Supplementary Material, Appendix 1. Results Cases were recorded at GSH (tertiary academic, 40%), MMH (regional obstetric, 39%) and NSH (regional, 21%). When com- pared to theatre logbooks, overall 80% of GAs were captured in the ObAMR (Table I). The obstetric GA rate at these centres was approximately 11% of all caesarean sections performed. At MMH there was a failure to record conversions from regional to general anaesthesia in the theatre logbooks, with one more GA case entered in the registry than recorded in theatre. This led to a falsely elevated capture rate of 101% at this institution. We excluded 32 patients requiring GA for infertility procedures (< 20 weeks gestation) at GSH, that had been entered in the theatre logbooks. Two incomplete records in the registry, with no location specified, were also excluded.

This begins to address the scarcity of airway-specific registry data for obstetric GA in the literature. On airway assessment, we encountered a high prevalence of factors predicting difficult tracheal intubation. Clinically significant hypoxaemia (saturation nadir < 90%) occurred in approximately one in eight patients (12%) and was more common in patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The overall incidence of hypoxaemia is similar to that described in a recent observational study conducted elsewhere in South Africa (16.8%). 17 Neuraxial anaesthesia offers advantages in obstetric patients in terms of avoidance of airway management. 18 Over the past 20 years, there has been a significant reduction in the use of GA for caesarean section, with corresponding increased use of neuraxial techniques.19 The challenges surrounding safe and timely se- curing of the airway in the obstetric patient are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in any setting.19 In 38 (19%) patients in our study, the primary indication for GA was failed neuraxial anaesthesia. This highlights an area for quality improvement in our setting. Airway difficulty has been reported to be eight times more common in obstetric patients compared to the general sur- gical population, 7 with the incidence of difficult or failed tracheal intubation remaining at 2.6 (95% CI 2.0–3.2) per 1 000 anaesthetics (1 in 390) for obstetric general anaesthesia. 7 Maternal mortality from failed intubation is 2.3 (95% CI 0.3–8.2) per 100 000 of all GAs for caesarean section (one death per 90 failed intubations), 7 and occurs from hypoxaemia secondary to airway obstruction or oesophageal intubation, or pulmonary aspiration.4,7 In this analysis, there were two cases of failed intubation (1%) with successful supraglottic airway rescue, and no emergency front of neck surgical access was required. There were no maternal deaths recorded in the registry. Most airway catastrophes occur when airway difficulty is not anticipated prior to induction of anaesthesia. 5 Timely evaluation of the parturient’s airway and adequate preparation to deal with potential complications are helpful in avoiding airway disasters. There are a few simple preoperative bedside clinical tests that can be performed to evaluate the airway, including the Mallampati score, mouth opening (inter-incisor gap), thyromental distance, neck mobility (atlanto-occipital extension), and ability to pro- trude the mandible.5,20,21 The relationship between increased grades of airway classification and relative difficulty of intubation in parturients undergoing caesarean delivery during GA, has been studied by Rocke et al.22 They found that the relative risk of difficult intubation in a parturient with a Mallampati class 3 airway was 7.58 times higher than in a parturient with a class 1 airway. This relative risk increased to 11.3 in patients with a class 4 airway. 22 We encountered Mallampati grade 3 or 4 in 29% of cases, and mouth opening, thyromental distance and mandibular protrusion were often limited. Maternal, fetal, surgical and situational factors contribute to the increased incidence of failed intubation. Many physiological changes occur during pregnancy, including physical character- istics such as increased BMI, breast enlargement, and generalised oedema. The mucosa of the upper respiratory tract also becomes more vascular and oedematous, especially during labour,23 leading to increased risk of airway bleeding and swelling.20 Fluid retention in head and neck tissues during pregnancy potentially narrows the upper airway and reduces compliance, making laryngoscopy more difficult. 19 Clinical teaching is that pharyngeal oedema may be exacerbated by preeclampsia and eclampsia, although there is limited literature to support this statement. In this analysis mild or severe airway oedema was encountered in 17% of patients. Videolaryngoscopy (VL) has been suggested as a useful adjunct for both anticipated and unanticipated difficulty in obstetric GA. The low rates of usage of VL and tracheal tube introducers in our registry (despite near- ubiquitous availability) is cause for concern, and an obvious target for quality improvement. There were several limitations of our study. The overall rate of capture of approximately 80% into the registry reflects that at least 20% of general anaesthesia cases were omitted. However, if the elevation of the capture rate due to the documentation practice at MMH is excluded, the rate may have been only 71%. It is unlikely that any category of airway challenge would have had a higher likelihood of reporting or omission, so that selection bias probably did not influence the outcome. Although the registry is rapidly completed by the attending anaesthetist, it is possible that periods of high case load may have reduced reporting. The ethical considerations concerning anonymity precluded our establishing the clinical circumstances of the cases not captured. Every attempt will be made to increase the capture rate, by emphasising the long-term benefits to patient safety of maintaining a complete registry. The anaesthesia provider during the GA was responsible for capturing the data onto the ObAMR, and data entry errors may have occurred. The online data capturing tool included definitions and pictures as a guideline, but certain data fields including preoperative airway assessment are subject to inter-observer variability. As clinicians were ultimately responsible for the GA technique, there may have been non-standardised performance. It was therefore often difficult to identify the contributing factors for the high incidence of hypoxaemia in our study. Strengths of our study include the successful establishment of the ObAMR, which we believe to be the first online database collecting information on airway management in the pregnant population in our setting. The aims of this registry are to enhance quality control and clinical governance, and to monitor and assess airway management trends during GA in this high-risk group of patients. 202South Afr J Anaesth Analg 2020; 26(4) http://www.sajaa.co.za Implementation and initial validation of a multicentre obstetric airway management registry The results of this initial analysis show that our online data- capturing tool is valuable for collecting information on airway management in the obstetric population. Hypoxaemia during GA for obstetric patients is still common. This registry will allow for broader analysis to be conducted on larger datasets and serve as the basis for the performance of future interventional studies.
