Innate Immune System: Epithelial cells, macrophages, mast cells, and innate lymphocytes at the pathogen exposure site activate and recruit circulating immune cells {neutrophils, NK cells, dendritic cells, platelets, monocytes, eosinophils). Pathogen-Recognition Receptors (PRRs): These receptors on immune cells bind to pathogen-associated Initial Immune Response: molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), triggering intracellular signaling cascades. Transcription Factors: Activation of NF-kB and AP-1 leads to the production of cytokines, coagulation factors, and inducible nitric oxide synthetase, initiating the immuno-inflammatory cascade. Adaptive Inmune Response: A stronger response involving the adaptive immune system follows the initial activation, leading to a ‘cytokine storm. Immune Response Balance: Normally, the immune response resolves the infection, balancing pro- and anti- inflammatory processes, and generating immune memory. Dysregulation: Excessive or dysregulated initial response can lead to dysfunctional balancing, shifting towards an Balance and Dysregulation: anti-inflammatory state (immunosuppression or sepsis- induced immunoparalysis). Immunoparalysis: Occurs around 24-48 hours post- infection, leading to features consistent with immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to new infections. Mechanisms include T-cell exhaustion, apoptosis, and anergy. Microvascular Stasis and Shunting: Stagnant blood flow and shunting prevent oxygenated blood from reaching hypoxic tissues. . Increased Glycolysis: Catecholamine-induced increase in Raised Lactate: >d Tycost . glycolysis rate, particularly in skeletal muscle. Mitochondrial Dysfunction: Decreased mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity due to cytokines and bacterial endotoxins. Increased intracellular catecholamine levels activate beta- 2 adrenoceptors in skeletal muscle. This activates G-protein mediated cAMP, which then Catecholamine-Related Glycolysis Increase: activates protein kinase A. Protein kinase Aincreases Na+/K+ ATPase activity, consuming excessive ATP and leading to anaerobic Sepsis Pathophysiology glycolysis. Pyruvate is normally converted to acetyl-CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase, which participates in the Krebs cycle. Mitochondrial Failure: Mechanisms of Septic Shock: Cytokines and bacterial endotoxins inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase, leading to lactate production.
