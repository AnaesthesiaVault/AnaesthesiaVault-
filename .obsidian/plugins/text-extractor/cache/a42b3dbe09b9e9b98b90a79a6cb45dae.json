Discussion of alternative treatments should be undertaken if available. It should be clearly documented in the medical record which 2 treatments and/or procedures the patient consents to and which they donot. At least 6 weeks before elective surgery likely to be associated ‘with significant blood loss, the patient's Hb should be checked and if < 130 gl-1, optimisation by treatment with iron and/or erythropoietin should be considered. Al relevant issues should be highlighted at the time of the team briefing and during the surgical safety checklist before induction of 4 anaesthesia. A specific checklist recording which components/products/procedures the patient will or will not accept should be available. The majority of Jehovah's Witnesses will accept intra-operative 5 cell salvage - this should be discussed before surgery and if agreed set up from the start of surgery. Consent should be obtained. The interventions promoted as part of a ‘patient blood 6 management' approach should be rigorously applied, including tranexamic acid administration for major surgery. After surgery, a comprehensive verbal and written handover of the patient is essential. Staff should be made aware of any adverse 7 intra-operative events and should understand and respect the wishes of the patient that will have been discussed before the procedure.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
