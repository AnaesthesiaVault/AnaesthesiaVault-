Subject exhales to the residual volume. Phase I: 0% nitrogen from anatomic dead space. Phase II: mixture of gas from anatomic dead space and alveoli. Phase I1I: “alveolar plateau” gas from alveoli. A steep slope of phase III indicates nonuniform distribution of alveolar gas. Phase IV: closing volume. Take-off point (closing capacity) of phase IV denotes the beginning of airway closure in dependent portions of the lung. (Reproduced with permission from Levitzky MG. Pulmonary Physiology, 8th ed.
