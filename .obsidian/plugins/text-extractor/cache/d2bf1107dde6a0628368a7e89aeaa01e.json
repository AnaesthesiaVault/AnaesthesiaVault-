DG cardioversion ineffective at these temperatures. ECG changes: prolonged PR, widened QRS, prolonged QT Thermal discomfort can be severe and has been rated as the worst part of hospitafisation by patients undergoing surgery. It can induce physical siresses such as elevation of blood pressure, heart rate and plasma catecholamines, which presumably contribule to the morbidity seen with mild perioperative hypothermia. Perioperative normothermia reduces the incidence of morbid cardiac events (1% vs. 6%) and veniricular tachycardia (2% vs. 9%). [Frank et al JAMA 1997, 227:1127]. 2.

Acktbase and g wanspor Oxygen and carbon dioxide Solubilities increase with cooling pH rises by 0.0147 per 1°C drop (Rosenthal factor). Water becomes less ionised at lower temperatures and therefore the hydrogen ion concentration fall. In nature, cold-blooded animals allow their pH to vary with body temperaure so the blood becomes more alkaline. This is comparable to the u-stat strategy of blood gas manipulation. Itis the most common method of practice in paediatric anaesthesia and may be a better strategy for optimising cerebral function after deep hypothermia and if circulatory arrest oceurs, since it prevents the accumulation of acid in the brain. However, exiremely low PaCO, causes vasoconstriction and may impair brain cooling. It is called «-stat because the a-imidazole group in histidine mimics that of water and is optimal for enzyme function Homeotherms, on the other hand, maintain constant arterial pH during hibemation by allowing CO, to accumulate. This is the pH strategy. In cardiac, this necessitates the addition of CO, to the pump when on bypass. Sturies beftween the two are contradictory with some studies demonstrating a good neurological outcome with o-stat whereas others fail to demonstrate a difference befween the tw techniques. ‘The oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve shifts to the left","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
