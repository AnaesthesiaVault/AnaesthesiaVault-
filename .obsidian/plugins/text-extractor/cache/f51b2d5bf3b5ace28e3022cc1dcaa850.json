Raised Ca & low Ph Most common cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients is malignancy Primary Parathyroid hormone-related peptide may cause significant hypercalcemia when secreted by a tumor (e.g., carcinoma of the lung or liver). Malignancies Bone invasion with accompanying osteolytic hypercalcemia may complicate multiple myeloma, Causes lymphoma, or leukemia. Adaptive response to hypocalcemia produced by conditions such as end-stage kidney disease or intestinal malabsorption syndromes. Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Low Ca &raised PTH.

Levels over 3 mmol/L should be corrected before surgery with 0.9% NaCl 1L over 1 hour, then 1L every 6 hours over Management 24 hours. Bisphosphonates (Pamidronate 60 mg in 500 9 mL of saline over 4 hours) can be added. Avoid hypoventilation (acidosis increases free Ca). Neuromuscular blockers may be antagonized.
