Animals receiving volatile and anaesthesia had both a reduced number and volume of lung metastases — Local anaesthetics may themselves have an inmunomodulatory effect and potentially a direct effect upon the malignancy itself — A positive impact with the use of regional anaesthesia, including prolonged overall and disease-free survival for breast, prostate, colorectal, ovarian, and head and neck cancers has e","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
