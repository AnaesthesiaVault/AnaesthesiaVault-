The initial doses shown in this table may differ from those recommended in immediate post-cardiac arrest management (ie, advanced cardiac life support). For details, refer to the UpToDate topic review of post-cardiac arrest management in adults, section on hemodynamic considerations. = Vasopressors can cause life-threatening hypotension and hypertension, dysrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia. They should be administered by use of an infusion pump adjusted by clinicians trained and experienced in dose titration of intravenous vasopressors using continuous noninvasive electronic monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, rhythm, and function. Hypovolemia should be corrected prior to the institution of vasopressor therapy. Reduce infusion rate gradually; avoid sudden discontinuation. = Vasopressors can cause severe local tissue ischemia; central line administration is preferred. When a patient does not have a central venous catheter, vasopressors can be temporarily administered in a low concentration through an appropriately positioned peripheral venous catheter (ie, in a large vein) for less than 24 hours. The examples of concentrations shown in this table are useful for peripheral (short-term) or central line administration Closely monitor catheter site throughout infusion to avoid extravasation injury. In event of extravasation, prompt local infiltration of an antidote (eg, phentolamine) may be useful for limiting tissue ischemia. Stop infusion and refer to extravasation management protocol. = Vasopressor infusions are high-risk medications requiring caution to prevent a medication error and patient harm. To reduce the risk of making a medication error, we suggest that centers have available protocols that include steps on how to prepare and administer vasopressor infusions using & limited number of standardized concentrations. Examples of concentrations and other detail are based on recommendations used at experienced centers: protocols can vary by institution.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
