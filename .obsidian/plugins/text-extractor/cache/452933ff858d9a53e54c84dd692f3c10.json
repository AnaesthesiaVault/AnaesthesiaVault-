The evaluation of the patient’s preoperative anticoagulation status is mandatory Baseline transesophageal Perform baseline transesophageal echocardiography echocardiography for assessing ventricular and valvular function During ischemia Heparin 1-2 mg/kg (150-200 [U/kg) with target ACT value > 300 s, prior to grafting Maintain heart rate between 70 and 80 bpm, MAP > 70 mmHg, SvO, > 70% Ensure adequate preload (infuse colloid if necessary) Use Trendelenburg position, reposition the heart in the holding device, vasopressors and/or inotropes (phenylephrine, dopamine, or norepinephrine) to treat hypotension (a microdrip of phenylephrine diluted to 40 pg/100 ml, flow adjusted manually is an easy way to increase MAP whilst avoiding overshooting Prevention and treatment of Monitor serum potassium and arrhythmias magnesium Treat sinus or supraventricular tachycardia using esmolol or diltiazem Use DC shock for ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation Use pacemaker for complete atrioventricular block Reperfusion and post-grafting Heparin should be partially or fully evaluation reversed Post-anastomosis TEE exam should be performed to check new and persistent regional wall motion abnormalities Postoperative course ICU or intermediate care unit: The patient is transferred to the ICU, extubated in 0-6 h Extubation criteria Patient should be awake, warm, pain free, and hemodynamically stable","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
