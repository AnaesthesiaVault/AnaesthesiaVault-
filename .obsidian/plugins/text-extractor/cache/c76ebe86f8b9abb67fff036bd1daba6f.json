A: At end-expiration, the muscles of respiration are relaxed. The nward elastic recoil of the lung is balanced by the outward elastic recoil of the chest wall Intrapleural pressure is —5 cm H»O; alveolar pressure is 0. The transmural pressure difference across the alveolus is therefore 0 cm HyO —(—5 cm H»O), or 5 ecm HyO. Since alveolar pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure, no airflow occurs. B: During inspiration, contraction of the muscles of inspiration causes intrapleural pressure to become more negative. The transmural pressure difference increases, and the alveoli are distended, decreasing alveolar pressure below atmospheric pressure, which causes air to flow into the alveoli.
