Symptoms that the patients might experience include early satiety, nausea, vomiting and bloating. Gastroparesis in diabstic patients usuaily occur after 10 years of the disease and is concurrent with retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. In the process of gastric emptying, the proximal stomach is the reservoir and distal the grinder. The particle size, fat and caloric content and physical nature defermines the rate of emptying as seen in the figure below. Non-nutrient liquids empty rapidly and the rate is fastest if there is a large volume. Solids are retained for churning in the stomach and once broken down to 2mm diameter particles empty during 2 phases over 3-4 hours. Glucose regulating hormenes act in different regions in the gut. In diabetic patients where the vagus s affected, there is a reduction in the motor coordination and numbers of cells. The patient with diabetic gastroparesis is thus at risk for aspiration.
