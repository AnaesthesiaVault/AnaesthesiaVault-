{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240408161745.png","text":"Pass scope along floor of nasal cavity directed inferiorly behind soft palate. Identify the nasal septum medially, turbinates laterally. Keep black hole (air cavity) in centre. Patient can assist in opening the airway by protruding tongue or deep inspiration. Pink out: mucosa (no cavity); white out: secretions; red out: blood. Suction or withdraw scope and reorientate. Targets: Epiglottis, vocal cords, tracheal cartilages, carina. Next landmark is epiglottis, advance scope into laryngeal opening, identify vocal cords and administer SAYGO lignocaine. Warn patient they may cough. Wait. Pass epidural catheter through the cords and administer further spray-as-you-go lignocaine. Advance scope into subglottic space and identify the tracheal rings. Advance scope until see carina. Advance ETT with gentle pressure and rotation, bevel laterally through nose (facing turbinates) and posteriorly through cords (facing arytenoids). Ask patient to inhale deeply just before you go through the cords. Do not force ETT, if resistance withdraw ETT rotate through 90\" anticlockwise and advance gently. Keep carina in field of vision at all times. Once ETT in trachea, remove scope and connect breathing circuit. Confirm ETT position with capnography, misting, auscultation. If concern about stability of cervical spine, assess neurology at this point. Induce anaesthesia with inhalational/IVI induction agent. Inflate cuff after induction (intensely stimulating). Confirm ETT placement with capnography and recheck position of ETT above carina. Extubate awake with all equipment available for reintubation. If fibreoptic intubation is not successful, options are preserved. Surgery can be postponed and an unhurried surgical airway can be performed. The keys to success in AFOI include good topical anaesthesia, an excellent rapport with the patient, skill and patience.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
