C. Do not pressurize above level of tear. D. Do not use transtracheal jet ventilation or a laryngeal mask airway with positive pressure. E. Consider use of a double-lumen tube, 2 small-diameter tubes, or a single-lumen tube with bronchial blocker. F. Consider cardiopulmonary bypass via femoral route for major tears. G. Do an awake fiber optic intubation for all major tears. H. If above interventions are not adequate or are not working, go directly to surgical airway maintenance. Table.
