As shown i (8),in diffusion, movement of solute across a semi- ‘permeable membrane i driven by a concentration gradient between the blood and the dialysate. Solutes move from the side with the higher concentration of particles o the side with the lower concentration. Dialysate fluid s pumped through the haemofiler in a counter-current direction and solutes are removed from the irculation via the process of diffusion. The waste dialysate is produced as effluent.
