The C fibres are examples of afferents that inhibit inhibitory inter- neurones and, therefore, enhance nociceptive transmission. Note that both types of fibre stimulate the second-order neurone (2°) directly but it is the interneurone that modifies the transmission.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
