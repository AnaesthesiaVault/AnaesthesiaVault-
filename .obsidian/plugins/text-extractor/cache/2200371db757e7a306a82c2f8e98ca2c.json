Recently, several international bodies have published con- sensus documents on the training requirements and important components that comprise focused or limited echocardiog- raphy (2, 3). It is clear that cardiac- or hemodynamic-based ultrasound has become an integral part of the critical care phy- sician’s toolbox (4, 5). The use of cardiac ultrasound in critical care has been demonstrated to improve the speed of diagnosis and significantly impact management decisions (6, 7). Impor- tantly, the application of ultrasound in septic patients has been associated with improved outcomes, including mortality (8). Despite point of care ultrasound being widely used in the critical care setting, curricula vary widely and competencies have not been defined. Furthermore, not all critical care fellow- ship-training programs offer formal education in ultrasound 1Division\tof\tCritical\tCare\tMedicine,\tDepartment\tof\tMedicine,\tUniversity\tof\t British\tColumbia,\tVancouver,\tBC,\tCanada. 2Department\tof\tEmergency\tMedicine,\tFraser\tHealth\tRegion,\tNew\tWest- minster,\tBC,\tCanada. 3Department\tof\tMedicine,\tUniversity\tof\tBritish\tColumbia,\tVancouver,\tBC,\t Canada. 4Department\tof\tCardiology,\tFraser\tHealth\tRegion,\tNew\tWestminster,\tBC,\t Canada. 5Department\tof\tAnesthesiology,\tPharmacology\tand\tTherapeutics,\tUniver- sity\tof\tBritish\tColumbia,\tVancouver,\tBC,\tCanada.

Cardiac ultrasound is a skill that has clearly become an integral part of the intensivist’s armamentarium and one that should be taught effectively. As programs evolve to provide training in this new skillset, many different curriculum options exist. In this systematic review, we sought to assess and report what the literature has shown to be effective when teaching car- diac ultrasound to critical care learners. Specifically, we wanted to report on curriculum content, mode of delivery, duration, and competency assessment. METHODS Data Sources and Searches Our search strategy was created and implemented prior to study selection according to Preferred Reporting Items for Sys- tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (10). A medi- cal librarian performed searches of MEDLINE (1945–2013), Embase (1974–2013), CINAHL (1982–2013), PsycInfo (1597– 2013), the Cochrane Center Register of Controlled Trials (1991–2013), and ERIC (1964–2013) on July 16 and 17, 2013, and removed duplicates. The search was updated on June 20 and June 23, 2014. Study Selection A search strategy was used that combined MeSH terms and free-text words in the title and abstract around three categories (Appendix 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww. com/CCM/B659). The categories included ultrasound terms such as “ultraso*,” “echocardiogra*,” or “sonogra*” and critical care terms, such as “critical care,” “intensive care,” “ICU,” “close support,” and education terms, such as “curricul*,” “train*,” “teach*,” or “educ*.” Included studies were limited to those that described car- diac or hemodynamic critical care ultrasound curricula for physicians (residents and staff). Exclusion criteria included pediatric patient population (age, < 16 yr), not critical care (internal medicine, emergency medicine, anesthesia, and obstetrics/gynecology), not primary literature, no curriculum description, ultrasound performed by radiologist, cardiologist, or allied health, survey of practice, not cardiac or hemody- namic assessment, and transesophageal echo (Fig. 1). Full-text articles for all studies deemed relevant were obtained and screened for inclusion. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion according to the exclusion criteria listed above (A.S.N., J.L.M.), and discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer (H.D.K.). Full-text articles of potential studies were then obtained and independently screened for inclusion (A.S.N., J.L.M.), and discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer (H.D.K.). Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Data were abstracted from studies into an excel database by two reviewers (A.S.N., J.L.M.). If relevant information was miss- ing from the studies, authors were contacted through e-mail. Data abstracted from the studies included the learner popula- tion, examination type, dura- tion, composition, and setting of the curriculum, means of evaluation, and outcomes (Table 1). Outcome measures abstracted included evalua- tion on written and practical examinations, percent agree- ment between the trainees and an expert, κ values for the agreement between trainees and an expert, and duration of the ultrasound examination (Table 1). Bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) (11). Scores for each study were entered into an excel spreadsheet. Two reviewers independently assessed studies, and consen- sus was reached in the event of a discrepancy (A.S.N., J.L.M.). Data Synthesis and Analysis There was significant het- erogeneity between the stud- ies including the learner Figure 1.

Data from individual studies are shown in Table 1. RESUlTS Our search results yielded a total of 654 possible studies after the removal of duplications. The majority of studies were excluded during the first screen (555) based on the above- stated exclusion criteria. The full texts of 99 articles were reviewed, and 15 studies were included for data extraction and quality assessment (Fig. 1). Based on the quality assessment, studies achieved a mean score of 4/8 using the NOS (Table 2) (11). The highest quality studies used a pre-post design, followed by studies that exclu- sively used ultrasound naive learners, followed by studies that did not consider previous ultrasound experience. Content of Curriculum The studies included in this review report heterogeneous cur- riculum content. Despite this variability, the core content of the curricula remained similar, namely, evaluation of general cardiac function (right ventricle [RV]/left ventricle [LV]) and pericardial effusion. When assessing global function or contrac- tility of the studies recommended using a qualitative approach in addition to a general Gestalt assessment of function the examination included querying for valvular dysfunction and took on average 5–10 minutes longer than other reported examinations; the rate of appropriate ejection fraction iden- tification was also lower (85% for LV after 30 or more scans) (12). Furthermore, most curricula recommend a very simpli- fied or binary assessment of normal or abnormal function, and there seemed to be better correlation when contractility was assessed in this manner with a report of nearly 100% success in identifying pathology in the study by Beraud et al (13) and sen- sitivity and specificity greater than 93% and 94% respectively, reported by Caronia et al (14). Differentiating grades of sever- ity or assessing for regional wall motion abnormalities added another level of complexity and may have resulted in increased disparity in interpretation (14). Generally, assessment and interpretation of LV function were more accurate than that for the RV (15, 16). In addition to contractility, a few of the cur- ricula (4/15) included the gross evaluation of valvular pathol- ogy with Doppler (12, 14, 15, 17). The interpretation and κ values were significantly lower for valve interrogation than for contractility. Most curricula included inferior vena cava (IVC) evaluation as a surrogate marker of volume responsive- ness (12, 13, 16–21). This skill was easily taught and applied by most of the learners evaluated. Finally, many of the cur- ricula embedded a cardiac- or hemodynamic-based cur- riculum amidst other domains, such as thoracic and vascular (19, 22, 23). The curricula that focused on cardiac alone seemed to have better results (13, 20, 24). Format of Delivery Each curriculum described a different method of content delivery; however, a few overarching themes became apparent. Almost all the curricula included both a theory and a hands- on training component. There were no head-to-head trials comparing a specific mode of delivery to another. Many (8/15) of the curricula included post-course independent scan- ning to assure competency. Unfortunately, the content, dura- tion, and learner population varied between studies limiting direct comparison. However, all studies showed a high rate of accuracy when interpretation was evaluated. In particu- lar, in the study by Melamed et al (24), intensivists received 2 hours of didactic training and 4 hours of hands-on training prior to the study. Four windows (parasternal long, para- sternal short, apical, and subcostal) were used to evaluate 44 ICU patients. Cardiologists evaluated the patients imme- diately before the trained intensivists. Intensivists graded LV function as normal, low normal, or severely abnormal. Inten- sivists correctly determined normal 92% of the time and abnormal 80% of the time with a positive predictive value for identifying any abnormality of 89% and negative predictive value of 85%. The κ statistic for agreement was 0.72. Theory was taught in several different formats, but many of the curricula required a component of “prereading” or precourse work that was presented through various formats, including basic text reading, web-based lectures, web-based simulations, and videos (12, 15, 18, 19, 25). A novel web- based, publically available, education resource seemed to be an effective tool that reduced the need for in-classroom teaching (12, 13). Including a hands-on or bedside component was nec- essary and incorporated either patients, volunteers, or simula- tion. Of note, not all curricula taught or practiced ultrasound on ventilated patients, and some were solely performed on simulated patients, perhaps challenging the validity of these curricula in the clinical setting (18). Simulation was used to impart technical skills and to help differentiate normal from abnormal physiology (13, 18). Duration of Curriculum The duration of the curricula included in this systematic review was again quite varied as were the components and modes of delivery. As previously mentioned, most curricula incorpo- rated both theoretical and hands-on components. For exam- ple, the study by Breitkreutz et al (25) was based on a one-day course, but it included a combination of precourse e-learning, web-based teaching, and assigned readings. The on-site course included 4 hours of theory provided in a didactic format and a 4-hour hands-on session. Commenting on an absolute duration of a curriculum is difficult as the mode of delivery and components within each curriculum differed. If the theoretical portion entailed indepen- dent learning, it often spanned days to weeks and roughly 10–40 hours (12, 15). If it was didactic, it was much shorter, spanning 1–2 days and 2–8 hours (14, 16, 24). There were also more lon- gitudinal formats requiring longer time commitments (15, 19). The hands-on components also varied quite considerably in duration with a range of 25 minutes to 15 hours (Table 1). Some curricula did not specify a duration per se but quantified the number of scans to be completed under supervision.

Online\tReview\tArticles Critical\tCare\tMedicine\t www.ccmjournal.org e747 average, a minimum of 4 hours of hands-on training seemed to be an accepted standard. Interestingly, to consolidate learning, several studies included a post-course component to maintain and solidify the skills acquired. Breitkreutz et al (25) supported and encouraged their trainees to conduct and document 50 post-course studies. Competency and Maintenance of Skills Competency and skill maintenance are fraught with discrep- ancy in the literature and within our included studies. For our purposes, we report competency based on the ability of the trainee to acquire and interpret an ultrasound image. When a pre- and postevaluation tool was used, trainees demonstrated an obvious improvement in theoretical knowledge. Unfortu- nately, the majority of studies did not detail their evaluation tools. Knowledge and image interpretation were also evaluated in the form of standardized testing or video image interpreta- tion (15, 25). Many studies used logbooks or recorded images to evaluate competence (Table 1). In addition, many of the studies report a subjective Likert-based improvement in both confidence and knowledge. Maintenance of skill was also infrequently addressed in the included studies. See et al (12) demonstrated that the accu- racy of both acquisition and interpretation was improved after 30 independent examinations. Royse et al (15) reported improved outcomes at 20 scans. Despite not reporting out- comes, Breitkreutz et al (25) describe that 50 simulation-based examinations are recommended for competency. The study by Chambers et al (17) was the only study to report on ongoing training and practice recommending that 10 case-based exam- inations can be administered on a 5-year basis to assess and maintain competency. DISCUSSION In this systematic review, we present and summarize the find- ings from studies reporting on cardiac ultrasound curricula in critical care. We believe that there is a need and interest to train critical care learners in ultrasound (9). A recent survey iden- tified that perception exists that training in (hemodynamic) ultrasound takes too long, and that only specialized individuals can perform these examinations (9). Through this systematic review, it has become clear that there is no standard curricu- lum. However, we have attempted to summarize the literature on this topic with regard to curricula format, content, dura- tion, and competency. Drawing conclusions has proven diffi- cult given the heterogeneity of the curricula included, but we are able to comment on the merits of different approaches. Both content and mode of delivery were quite variable across studies; however, they all used cardiac function as a measurable outcome. The limited cardiac evaluation is designed to define TAblE 2.

Kanji et al e748 www.ccmjournal.org\t August\t2016\t•\tVolume\t44\t•\tNumber\t8 gross pathology and assist in clinical decision making with regard to resuscitation, management, and diagnosis but not necessarily to evaluate subtle abnormalities, such as regional wall motion abnormalities, valvular dysfunction, or diastology (26). This approach is appropriate as over complicating curri- cula seem to increase the demand on time and human resources while potentially limiting knowledge translation and retention (12). Content and educational deliveries are competing factors. We report that curricula with increased content generally take longer to teach, and the additional information is not trans- lated well leading to poorer performance in the clinical setting. In addition, the study by See et al (12) reports that the more detailed bedside examination is roughly 5–10 minutes longer than other reported examinations. This is an important fact to consider as the objective of this examination should be to elicit necessary information to guide clinical decision making. Royse et al (15) demonstrated that an extensive curriculum is both resource heavy (5:1 student to teacher ration and over 40 hours of reading), while likely compromising assessment and agree- ment of “moderate” disease severity states. This is recapitulated by a very simple curriculum taught with little resource dedica- tion by Ferrada et al (20), which showed 100% correlation of findings. In addition, this is one of the few studies that evalu- ated outcomes on all ICU intubated patients in a goal directed manner. Critical care cardiac ultrasound curricula should focus on simplicity but impart the skills necessary to help clinical decision making. The curricula that were more basic in nature and assessed cardiac function as a binary or qualitative out- come, appeared to have been taught is less time and had better reproducibility (13, 16, 20, 27). Due to differences in teaching modalities and evaluation, it is difficult for us to make recom- mendations with regard to specific content, but what seemed to be most effective was a simple assessment of LV and RV function (binary or qualitative), as well as IVC size and collaps- ibility. Gross valvular and wall motion abnormalities could be included in curricula; however, this will require a longer period of instruction and follow-up (12, 15, 17). The challenges around drawing conclusion are that many of the studies did not include intubated patients, and some evaluated outcomes were based on interpretation of standard/simulated scenarios (12, 15, 17, 18). Therefore, it is difficult to compare outcomes; despite these differences, it was clear that more elaborate content required more resource allocation to teaching, longer bedside evaluation, and impaired knowledge translation. A basic and binary out- come-based curriculum seems to have the best results for the purposes of guiding important and real-time clinical decisions. Multiple delivery methods were used, including prereading (independent), didactic, web based, and hands on (live or sim- ulation). Web-based delivery is an attractive option and was presented by See et al (12) and Sekiguchi et al (18). In the study by Sekigushi et al (18), they report an improvement in trainee skill and knowledge although it is unclear if their skill test had been validated. Interestingly, they also found that posttest results were better when a didactic session was included (18). This may suggest that web-based education alone is insuffi- cient as a sole training modality. Simulation was also presented as an option and has been shown previously to be effective in medical education; however, its role in ultrasound educa- tion is quite limited (28). Given the perceived time constraints mentioned previously, a multipronged approach, includ- ing both web-based and simulation, should be explored. See et al (12) reported a publically available web-based resource to teach theoretical knowledge to trainees. This 10-hour of self- learning method, although not evaluated, seemed to provide the necessary knowledge base on which to teach the practical component of the curriculum. Given the availability of high- quality web-based ultrasound tools, we suggest integrating this into training programs. To ensure that trainees do study the prematerial, a pretest could be administered either remotely or during the in-person sessions. Finally, adding a short in-person didactic component may enhance knowledge translation to this “virtual” approach. Including a hands-on teaching component is critical. Theoretical knowledge is necessary for the interpretation of images, but image acquisition is an absolutely necessary com- ponent of ultrasound proficiency. The options for teaching this skill include either a simulated volunteer, simulated manikin, or “real” patients in the clinical setting. The studies in this sys- tematic review used all of these modalities to some degree and with some level of success. These studies also support our belief that hands-on training is vital and that these skills need to be practiced on a regular basis. In the studies, we reviewed, hands- on training ranged from 3 to 15 hours, with the 15-hour study reporting the best outcomes (100% identification of pathology) with the caveat that only 72% of the trainees were naive (13). Given the variability in the methods used, it is difficult to make specific recommendations; however, it would be reasonable to allocate a minimum of 5 hours, keeping in mind that outcomes seem to improve with longer training periods (up to 10 hr) or greater numbers of scans (30–50). Furthermore, there seems to be merit in training on both “normal” or simulated patients to allow for baseline knowledge acquisition but also on ventilated ICU patients. Image acquisition on ventilated patients can often be challenging. Manasia et al (29) reported that 40% of learners reported difficulty in obtaining images in the critical care setting. Despite this difficultly, the images were adequate for interpreta- tion and did influence management. We believe that learning and practicing ultrasound skills on ventilated patients in the ICU is necessary and should comprise a significant proportion of the hands-on component, and we were surprised to find that many curricula did not include this in their training program. The number of studies necessary to obtain competence is debatable. Consensus and expert opinion suggest that 30 studies can be used as a baseline (30). In our review, we assess competency as the ability to both acquire and inter- pret images correctly. The study by See et al (12) addressed this issue, and they showed a greater proportion of accept- able images and correct image interpretation after 30 practice images compared with 10 (70.2% vs 92.1%). This was con- firmed by Vignon et al (16) who compared the results from their previous pilot trial with an average 15 (11–20) indepen- dent studies, when compared with 33 (29–33). They showed Copyright © 2016 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Online\tReview\tArticles Critical\tCare\tMedicine\t www.ccmjournal.org e749 that there was an associated improvement in assessment with more practice. Making any sort of viable conclusions is severely biased by several factors. Each study reporting on competence included a heterogeneous population with varied prior experi- ence. In addition, the curriculum content and administration were also discrepant. Finally, the evaluation, both in terms of content and time point, was not standardized making com- parison virtually impossible. Based on the available data, we would suggest that a minimum of 30 scans can be the mini- mum to achieve “competence”; however, this element of the curriculum would have to be studied more rigorously prior to making any strong recommendations. Maintenance of skill is very difficult to comment on based on the studies reported in this systematic review. One of the studies we reviewed suggested that a 10-case examination can be administered every 5 years; however, this has not been vali- dated (17). It is logical that a certain number of studies can be completed on an annual basis, but we are unable to report on evidence to support a specific recommendation. This systematic review has many limitations. The stud- ies included lack standardization of quality in the delivery of content and hands-on training. This makes objective com- parison and evaluation of the curricula virtually impossible. Assessments were, therefore, made on a more qualitative basis, and our recommendations are based on logic and merit. In addition, there was significant variability in how each curricu- lum was evaluated, again limiting our ability to directly com- pare one study with another. The populations included in the studies were heterogeneous with most including naive learners but some including clinicians with some level of experience. Finally, the quality of these studies was quite variable lacking high-level evidence, and nearly all studies failed to specify how learners were recruited, making them prone to bias. CONClUSIONS We have summarized several studies reporting on cardiac- based ultrasound curricula for critical care. The study popula- tions, methods, and bedside teaching varied considerably. This is a valuable skill that should be included in critical care train- ing programs. We recommend a simplified (binary outcome) approach with respect to content, incorporating both web-based and didactic learning sessions to provide the best use of resources and outcomes. Learning on both simulated and real (ventilated) patients is suggested, and a minimum of 30 independent studies is recommended to achieve some level of competency.
