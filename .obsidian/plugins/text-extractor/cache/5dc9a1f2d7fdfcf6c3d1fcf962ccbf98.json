Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (>50% of HCM) Myocyte Disarray: Gives HCM its arrhythmogenic potential, unlike the hypertrophy seen in chronic hypertension. Thickening and Disarray of Left Ventricular Disorganized Myocytes: Disrupt signal conduction, leading Myocardium to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Thickening of Septum: Causes narrowing of the left ventricular outflow tract. Narrowed Outflow Tract: Accelerates blood flow, causing Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM, a Venturi effect lower pressure area). H â€” LR, PathODhysIOIOQY of HOCM 25% of HCM) Anterior Mitral Valve Leaflet Displacement: Blocks outflow of blood into the aorta, exacerbating obstruction. Decreased Contractility: Lessens the obstruction, allowing blood to be ejected into the aorta at end-systole. Impaired Ventricular Filling: Leads to diastolic dysfunction and decreased stroke volume (SV). Hemodynamic Consequences Increased Left-Sided Pressure: Causes blood to back up into the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. Decreased Cardiac Output {(CO): Due to decreased SV and increased heart rate (HR). Cardiac Output Fatigue: Due to decreased myocardial oxygen supply and increased demand from hypertrophied myocytes.
