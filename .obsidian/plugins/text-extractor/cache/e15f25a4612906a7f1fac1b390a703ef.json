{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240214122732.png","text":"There was a non-significant trend to lower mortality in the restrictive group in patients with clinically significant cardiac disease [20.5% vs. 22.9% p=0.69]; and cardiac events (primarily pulmonary oedema and myocardial infarction) were more frequent in the liberal strategy group than in the restrictive strategy (p<0.01). However, there was no significant difference in 30-day mortality between the 2 transfusion arms in the subgroup of patients who had a primary or secondary diagnosis of cardiac disease (20.5% in the restrictive armvs. 22.9% in the liberal arm; p=0.69). The conclusions from the TRICC trial were that a “restrictive strategy of red cell transfusion is at least as effective as and possibly superior to, a liberal transfusion strategy in the critically ill, except possibly for ‘patients with active coronary ischaemic syndromes”. The last part of their conclusion is puzzling, as there was no evidence to suggest any harm with restrictive transfusions in patients with cardiac disease! The TRISS Trial (Holst 2014) looked at transfusion triggers in septic shock. This trial took 998 patients with septic shock and an Hb <9g/dL. The restrictive group received one unit of leucodepleted red cells when the Hb s7g/dL, and the liberal transfusion group received one unit of leucodepleted red cells when the Hb <9g/dL. The primary outcome was death by 90 days: mortality was not significantly different between the two groups. ATRISS follow up study was published in 2016; this showed that there was.no difference in 1 year mortality rates between the 2 groups, as well as no difference in health-related quality of life. Although the two TRISS studies show no benefit with a restrictive transfusion strategy, it demonstrates that a restrictive transfusion trigger is safe {(Rygarad 2016).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
