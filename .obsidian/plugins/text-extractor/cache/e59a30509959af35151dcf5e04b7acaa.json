Malignant hyperthermia more difficult to trigger from hypothermic baseline...and once triggered, less severel Complications 1. Increased systemic vascular resistance Arrhythmias (including bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation at 256-30°C). DC cardioversion ineffective at these temperatures. ECG changes: prolonged PR, widened QRS, prolonged QT Thermal discomfort can be severe and has been rated as the worst part of hospitalisation by patients undergoing surgery. It can induce physical stresses such as elevation of blood pressure, heart rate and plasma catecholamines, which presumably contribute to the morbidity seen with mild perioperative hypothermia. Perioperative normothermia reduces the incidence of morbid cardiac events (1% vs. 6%) and ventricular tachycardia (2% vs. 9%). [Frank et al JAMA 1997, 227:1127]. 2. Gerebrovascular system Decreased cerebral metabolic rate (7-10% per every 1°C) Decreased cerebral blood flow Loss of consciousness accurs at 28-30°C 3. Respiratory system Lack of hypoxic drive Attenuation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction * ! ! ecreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate !Ecrease! !oo! flow (in hepatic artery more than hepatic portal vein) Increased size of fiver Decreased metabolic and excretory functions 6._Acid base and gas ransport Oxygen and carbon dioxide solubilities increase with cooling pH rises by 0.0147 per 1°C drop (Rosenthal factor). Water becomes less ionised at lower temperatures and therefore the hydrogen ion concentration falls. In nature, cold-blooded animals allow their pH to vary with body temperature so the blood becomes more alkaline. This is comparable to the o-stat strategy of blood gas manipulation. Itis the most comman method of practice in paediatric anaesthesia and may be a better strategy for optimising cerebral function after deep hypothermia and if circulatory arrest oceurs, since it prevents the accumulation of acid in the brain. However, extremely low PaCO;, causes vasoconstriction and may impair brain cooling. It is called «-stat because the a-imidazole group in histidine mimics that of water and is optimal for enzyme function.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
