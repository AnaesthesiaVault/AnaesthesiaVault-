Problems associated with the cleft itself (e.g., feeding General difficulties, failure to thrive). Preoperative assessment should address: . . Presence of congenital anomalies or syndromes. Risk of difficult intubation. Congenital heart disease: Prevalence of 1.3-51%, with septal defects being most common. Associated Conditions lRelcurrent rtlespirlatury tract infections (RTI): Mure common in infants with wide cleft palates or severe bilateral cleft lip and palate. 0SA and developmental delay. Infants <6 months of age. Airway Assessment == Predictors of difficult laryngoscopy: —{ Bilateral complete cleft lips. Retrognathia or micrognathia. Usually not required. P dicati remedication _< Atropine and glycopyrrolate occasionally used toreduce secretions. Inhalational induction: Obtain IV access and secure well. Intubation: South-facing oral RAE tube. PPV: Positive pressure ventilation. Induction and Intubation Use a straight laryngoscope blade. Place a roll of gauze or a swab into the cleft to prevent the Difficult intubation tips: laryngoscope from “falling into” the cleft. Prepare difficult intubation equipment for syndromic children, especially those with Pierre-Robin. Preoperative Assessment and . Throat pack: Prevent airway soiling or ingestion of blood; Management of Cleft Llp and Palate ensure removal before emergence. Surgery Dingman mouth gag: For maximum surgical access and Anaesthetic Management Intraoperative Considerations visibility; ensure tube position and ventilation are checked. Medications: Antibiotics, corticosteroids, and anti- emetics. Fluids: Ringer's lactate/Plasmalyte/Balsol with 1-2% dextrose if at risk of hypoglycaemia. Intraoperative Fluids Blood loss: Consider tranexamic acid for the “oozy” palate; prophylactic use is controversial. Position: Left lateral, slightly head down, and fully awake. Extubati xtubation _< Deep extubation: For non-syndromic children to minimize coughing and bleeding. Multimodal analgesia: Necessary for cleft palate surgery. Paracetamol and NSAIDs: Avoid NSAIDs in cleft palate Analgesia surgery due to bleeding risk. Regional anaesthesia: Infra-orbital nerve blocks for cleft lip; maxillary nerve block for cleft palate. Most common and dreaded complication. Risk factors: Congenital anomalies {e.g., Pierre Robin sequence), prolonged surgical time, excessive pressure Airway Obstruction from Dingman gag, and wide cleft. Management: Position patient laterally or prone, pull tongue forward, consider nasopharyngeal airway or LMA, Postoperative Care intubation, or surgical airway. Flap monitoring: Vital for the first 48 hours. ERAS: Minimize preoperative fasting, early postoperative Postoperative Monitoring nutrition, pulmonary physllutherapy, and early tracheostomy decannulation. Highcare or ICU: Depending on the child's baseline condition. L] * * Made with QWhlmswal","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
