In a simplified model, coagulation factors are illustrated upon the activated platelet surface. Through the activation of factor X (Xa) via intrinsic (Factor IXa, Villa) and extrinsic tenase (Xase) complexes, factors Xa and Va convert factor I (prothrombin) to factor Ifa (thrombin). Thrombin then cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin. Fibrin polymerization is faciitated by the activation of factor XIl that forms. cross links leading to clot stabilization. Factor II, VI (not pictured), IX (not pictured) and X are targeted for repletion with prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) administration. Factor Vila s targeted for repletion with administration of recombinant factor Vlla (fFVIla). Simultancously, anticoagulants negatively modulate clot formation. Antithrombin III (ATII) modulates factor lla (primarily) and factor Xa (secondarily), but ATIII-dependent inhibition of factor IXa, Xla, and VIa-TF complex occurs to a lesser extent (not pictured). Other important anticoagulants include TFPI-modulation of Tissue Factor and factor Vila, and Activated Protein C (APC) which, through activation of protein S, inhibits factor Va, weakening the prothrombinase complex and impairing thrombin generation. Upstream, APC inhibits factor VIlIa of the intrinsic Xase complex. Factor Ifa complexes with Thrombomodulin (TM) to activate PC. Of note, the thrombin-TM/PC/PS system is pri- marily localized to the endothelium but can be expressed on platelets and monocytes. This complex initiates thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), which prevents plasmin production by inhibiting tissue-plasminogen activator and through direct inhibition of plasminogen (not pictured). Plasmin is a serine protease and, as the primary driver of fibrinolysis, results in clot destabilization, degradation of fibrin cross linkage, and production of fibrin degradation prod- ucts, which include D-dimers. Plasmin triggers platelet activation (not pictured) thereby competing with TAFI at the local level.
