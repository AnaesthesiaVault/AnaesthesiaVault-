Point-of-care ultrasound is a non-invasive, non-ionising diagnostic tool that is available at the bed-side when complications occur. This review covers the use of ultrasound in various clinical situations. Gastric ultrasound can identify stomach contents that put the woman at risk for pulmonary aspiration. In the future, this tool will probably be used routinely before induction of anaesthesia to determine the presence of stomach contents above a particular risk threshold. Difﬁcult tracheal intubation, and the potential for ‘can’t intubate, can’toxygenate’, is more frequent in pregnant women. Point-of-care ultrasound of the airway allows accurate identiﬁcation of the cricothyroid membrane, permitting rapid and safer establishment of front-of-neck airway access. Combined cardiac and lung ultrasound can determine the potential risk:beneﬁtof ﬂuid administration in the pregnant patient. Such prediction is of critical importance, given the tendency of pregnant women to develop pulmonary oedema. Combined echocar- diography and lung ultrasound can be combined with ultrasound of the leg veins to differentiate between the various causes of acute respiratory failure, and guide treatment in this situation. Finally, as shown in the general population, multi-organ point-of-care ultrasound allows early diagnosis of the main causes of circulatory failure and cardiac arrest at the bed-side. As the importance of point-of-care ultrasound in critical patients is increas- ingly recognised, it is emerging as an important tool in the therapeutic armoury of obstetric anaesthetists. .................................................................................................................................................................

Introduction In the UK and Europe, anaesthetists are involved with the majority of peripartum women. Most cases are low risk, but there is the potential for severe complications that threaten the wellbeing and life of both the woman and her fetus. These may occur in a low-risk unit, and may develop rapidly, making it difﬁcult to obtain specialist diagnostic help. Invasive monitoring is generally avoided if possible [1], and drugs and irradiation are only used when essential due to risks to the fetus. © 2018 The Association of Anaesthetists 1 Anaesthesia 2018 doi:10.1111/anae.14354 Ultrasound is ubiquitous in obstetric practice for fetal monitoring. It also has the potential for maternal bed-side diagnostic and screening procedures, and can be seen as an extension of clinical assessment [2]. Pregnancy is associated with increased risk of aspiration of gastric contents, difﬁcult airway access, acute respiratory failure and cardiovascular compromise [3–7]. This review covers the use of ultrasound for assessment of gastric contents and the airway, management of the breathless patient, prediction of ﬂuid responsiveness and diagnosis of shock. Methods We searched the literature from 2007 to 2017 using the Pubmed database. Articles in English and French were considered for analysis. For speciﬁc issues, seminal studies were reported at our discretion. The titles of the articles were screened for relevance of content and, based on this initial screening, selected for review of the abstract. Two of the authors reviewed the abstracts (ML and LZ) and selected the articles for full download. The references of these articles were then manually screened for additional relevant articles. The two main selection criteria to determine ﬁnal inclusion were relevance to the topic at hand and quality (expert opinion). The review includes sections on assessment of gastric contents and airway access, prediction of ﬂuid responsiveness, man- agement of acute respiratory failure and diagnosis of shock. The keywords for these sections are listed in Appendix S1. We did not cover the use of ultrasound for regional anaesthesia, as this has been well described elsewhere. Gastric contents Rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation has traditionally been recommended for obstetric general anaesthesia [8], due to the perceived risk of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration in unstarved women presenting for emergency surgery, as well as the reduction in lower oesophageal sphincter tone during pregnancy. It is some- times taught that second- and third-trimester pregnant women by deﬁnition have a ‘full stomach’, that is, above the risk threshold for aspiration of gastric contents. Ultra- sound of the stomach allows the assessment of the actual volume and nature of stomach contents, allowing an informed decision of the risk and hence aiding decision making [9, 10]. Point-of-care ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum has been well described in non-pregnant adults, and the technique is largely standardised [11–17]. A 2–5-MHz abdominal probe is used. The gastric antrum is identiﬁed in the sagittal plane in the epigastric area, using the left lobe of the liver and the aorta as internal landmarks (Fig. 1). The antrum is empty when it is ﬂat, with juxtaposed anterior and posterior walls. Hypo-echoic matter in a dilated antrum indicates clear ﬂuid contents, and echoic matter indicates solid contents [18]. A qualita- tive grading scale is often used as an indicator of gastric volume [15]. Grade 0, where an empty antrum is seen in both supine and right lateral decubitus positions, repre- sents lack of any contents. Grade 1, where ﬂuid content is seen in the right lateral decubitus position only, corre- sponds to a gastric ﬂuid volume of < 100 ml in 77% of patients. Grade 2, deﬁned as ﬂuid contents present in both the right lateral decubitus and the supine positions, corresponds to a gastric ﬂuid volume > 100 ml in 75% of patients and > 250 ml in 50% of patients [15, 19]. Alternatively, quantitative assessment of gastric volume may be performed. An ultrasound view of the gastric antrum in the sagittal plane enables measurement of the antral cross-sectional area, using either free tracing or measurement of the maximum anteroposterior (D1) and longitudinal (D2) diameters, using the equation: antral cross-sectional area = p 9 D1 9 D2/4. Antral cross-sectional area correlates with directly or indirectly measured gastric volume [12, 14]. Aorta Liver Antrum Uterus Figure 1 Gastric ultrasound image in a term pregnant woman in the semirecumbent position, showing a ﬂat antrum with no gastric contents. 2 © 2018 The Association of Anaesthetists Anaesthesia 2018 Zieleskiewicz et al. | Point-of-care ultrasound in obstetric anaesthesia Bouvet el al. suggested that antral cross-sectional area measured in the semirecumbent position discrimi- nates between stomach contents below or above a risk threshold (gastric volume > 0.8 ml.kg\u00011 or the presence of solid contents) using a cut-off value of 340 mm² [12]. The right lateral decubitus position may be more reliable than the semirecumbent position to derive gastric ﬂuid volume from antral cross-sectional area, using a formula that includes the age of the patient [19]. Several different algorithms have been proposed [16, 20]. An alternative threshold that has been suggested for an increased risk of aspiration is either a calculated gastric ﬂuid volume > 1.5 ml.kg \u00011 or the presence of solid contents [16, 20]. Table S1 shows studies of ultrasound of the gastric antrum in pregnant women in the last 10 years [21–31]. Ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum is more difﬁcult in pregnant and labouring women than in non- pregnant adults [26, 28], with a rate of inconclusive examination that may reach 17.4% [24]. Epigastric probe placement may be hindered by the steep angle between the xiphoid process and abdomen caused by the gravid uterus. Cephalad displacement of the stomach by the uterus affects ultrasound views of the gastric antrum through the left lobe of the liver and the aorta in the sagittal plane (Fig. 1). The depth of the antrum, the distance between the gastric antrum and the aorta and the antral cross-sectional area increase signiﬁcantly during pregnancy [26]. Studies of the grade 0–2 qualitative scale in pregnant woman have been performed in the semirecumbent and semirecumbent right-lateral positions, modiﬁed from the original supine and right-lateral positions [15]. There is little change in grades before and after caesarean section, supporting the validity of the scoring system in term pregnant women [26]. Arzola et al. found high inter-rater reliability when qualitative assessment of gastric contents was used to distinguish between a stomach below a risk threshold, a stomach containing clear ﬂuids and one containing solids [22]. A recent study, using magnetic resonance imaging to measure gastric ﬂuid volume in women in the third trimester of pregnancy, reported that the grading scale allowed diagnosis of ﬂuid volume > 0.8 ml.kg\u00011 with acceptable performance [29]. Recently described mathematical models for antral cross-sectional area in pregnant women in the semirecumbent right-lateral position, or both the semirecumbent and semirecumbent right-lateral positions, may allow calculation of volume of gastric contents [29, 31]. These models apply either to clear ﬂuids only, or to any gastric contents, but have large 95%CI limits, cor- responding to large and clinically signiﬁcant inaccuracy. As for non-pregnant adults, cut-off values of antral cross-sectional area may be used to discriminate between stomach contents below or above a risk threshold. In the semirecumbent position, an area < 387 mm 2 indicates gastric volume < 0.4 ml.kg \u00011 with high sensitivity, suggest- ing low risk for pulmonary aspiration, whereas area > 608 mm 2 indicates volume > 1.5 ml.kg \u00011 with high speciﬁcity, and therefore increased risk of aspiration [24, 27]. In the semirecumbent right-lateral position, the cut-off value for cross-sectional area associated with gastric vol- ume > 1.5 ml.kg \u00011 is higher, ranging between 719 and 960 mm², with similar performance [24, 31]. Gastric ultrasound has been used to assess gastric clearance of water or a light meal in non-labouring term pregnant women [25, 32, 33]. Although clearance of water is unchanged in late pregnant women [27, 32], clearance of a light meal is delayed [25, 30]. This suggests that fasting duration should be increased, or that pre-operative ultrasound assessment of gastric contents should be performed, in women scheduled for caesarean section. During labour, residual gastric volume assessed by gastric ultrasound is increased in women eating a light meal in comparison with those drinking water only [34, 35]. Bataille et al. performed ultrasound measurements at request for epidural analgesia and at full cervical dilation in 60 fasting labouring women. Gastric emptying was at least partially preserved, with only 13% of the group having contents above the risk threshold at full cervical dilation [21]. Conversely, other authors reported that only half the women with epidural analgesia allowed to drink during labour had an empty stomach after delivery; there were no associated predictive factors [28]. As several factors may affect gastric emptying during labour, such as fasting policy, opioids or regional analgesia, ultra- sound examination of the gastric antrum may become a useful tool for determining the contribution of each factor to gastric emptying, and hence steering future guideline development. In clinical practice, ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum may combine both qualitative and quanti- tative assessments. As for non-pregnant patients, com- posite ultrasound grading may be used to discriminate between stomach contents below and above a risk threshold [29, 36]. Combining an antral area cut-off value of 505 mm² in the semirecumbent position with the quali- tative scale improves performance for identiﬁcation of gastric ﬂuid volume > 1.5 ml.kg \u00011 and > 0.8 ml.kg\u00011 [29]. © 2018 The Association of Anaesthetists 3 Zieleskiewicz et al. | Point-of-care ultrasound in obstetric anaesthesia Anaesthesia 2018 This composite scale may be integrated into a clinical algorithm that minimises the requirement for positioning of the pregnant woman in the semirecumbent right- lateral position, which may be contraindicated in the presence of maternal or fetal compromise. This algorithm can determine whether gastric volume is above or below 1.5 ml.kg\u00011 in > 90% of pregnant women [29]. Brieﬂy, the gastric antrum is ﬁrst examined in the semirecumbent position. Viewing clear ﬂuid contents (corresponding to grade 2) or solid contents in this position corresponds to gastric contents above the risk threshold, requiring rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation in case of general anaesthesia. In case of a grade-0 antrum in the semirecumbent position, the antral cross-sectional area should be measured. If the antral area is < 505 mm², there is a high probability of gastric contents below the risk threshold. The woman should be turned to the semirecumbent right-lateral posi- tion only if the antrum is grade 0 with area ≥ 505 mm². This will enable discrimination between a grade-0 antrum (empty stomach) and a grade-1 antrum (above the risk threshold). This brief ultrasound examination might be applied before urgent general anaesthesia, in order to aid deci- sion making in the event of failed tracheal intubation. Airway management A recent review of the literature reported that the rate of failed tracheal intubation in obstetric cases has remained unchanged between 1970 and 2015, with an incidence of failed tracheal intubation of 2.6 per 1000 general anaesthetics for obstetric procedures, and 2.3 per 1000 general anaesthetics for caesarean section [37]. In the event of failed tracheal intubation, general anaesthesia is usually continued rather than waking the patient up. The recent Obstetric Anaesthetists’ Association/Difﬁcult Airway Society guidelines for the management of difﬁcult and failed tracheal intubation in obstetrics emphasise that an airway assessment should be performed before induc- tion of general anaesthesia. This assessment is intended to predict not only difﬁcult tracheal intubation but also difﬁculties with supraglottic airway device use, mask ven- tilation and front-of-neck airway access [10]. Clinical assessment to predict difﬁculties in intubation is unreli- able [37, 38], and to date ultrasound methods for most aspects of airway assessment have not proven reliable [39–41]. However, the use of ultrasound to aid front- of-neck airway access, which may be required in 1 in 60 failed intubations for a ‘can’t intubate, can’t oxygenate’ situation [37], shows more promise. Identiﬁcation of the cricothyroid membrane using digital palpation may be difﬁcult, in particular in obese non-pregnant and labouring women [42, 43]. Difﬁculties in locating the cricothyroid membrane may lead to a failed invasive airway procedure, with severe morbidity or death [37, 44]. Airway ultrasound signiﬁcantly increases the rate of accurate identiﬁcation of the cricothyroid membrane in comparison with clinical palpation [45]. In cadavers and in manikins with poorly identiﬁable airway anatomy, ultrasound improves the success rate of cricothyroidotomy [46, 47]. Two methods have been described for ultrasound identiﬁcation of the cricothyroid membrane, the transverse and longitudinal techniques (Fig. 2). The transverse technique relies on identiﬁcation of the cricothyroid membrane as a hyperechoic line seen between the thyroid cartilage cephalad and the cricoid cartilage caudad. The anatomical structures are identiﬁed when sliding a transversely placed ultrasound transducer up and down the front of the neck [48]. The longitudinal technique relies on viewing the trachea with the ultra- sound transducer initially placed transversely, while sliding it towards the right side of the patient. The transducer is then rotated 90° into the sagittal plane in order to achieve a longitudinal view of the trachea (tracheal rings give a ‘string of pearls’ image), and then cephalad until the cricoid cartilage and the thyroid Cricothyroid membrane Cricoid car\u0002lageThyroid car\u0002lage Cricothyroid membrane (a) (b) Figure 2 Ultrasound identiﬁcation of the cricothyroid membrane using (a) transverse technique (b) longitudinal technique. 4 © 2018 The Association of Anaesthetists Anaesthesia 2018 Zieleskiewicz et al. | Point-of-care ultrasound in obstetric anaesthesia cartilage are identiﬁed [49]. In morbidly obese female subjects, the transverse technique is faster than the longi- tudinal technique for identiﬁcation of the cricothyroid membrane, but both methods are equally accurate [50]. Current guidelines advocate consideration of ultrasound examination to locate the site of potential anterior neck access, even in emergency procedures [10]. Ideally, this assessment should be systematically performed before induction of general anaesthesia [10, 51]. Point-of-care airway ultrasound may also be used to conﬁrm that the tube is correctly placed in the trachea. Real-time ultrasound examination of the trachea during laryngoscopy and intubation, with a transverse probe, allows immediate identiﬁcation of correct tube location with a hyperechoic shadow in the trachea. Conversely, an enlarged oesophagus corresponds to oesophageal intuba- tion [52]. Tracheal dilation from tracheal tube cuff inﬂation may alsobeusedto conﬁrm correct tracheal intubation (Fig. 3) [53]. Ramsingh et al. recently demonstrated that ultrasound visualisation of tracheal dilation during cuff inﬂation with air, combined with evaluation of pleural lung sliding, was superior to auscultation in determining the location of the tracheal tube in adult patients [54]. Although a similar study has not been performed during obstetric anaesthesia, these results should apply equally. Early diagnosis and treatment of acute breathlessness during pregnancy Acute respiratory failure is one of the leading non-obstetric causes of admission to the intensive care unit during pregnancy [55]. The physiological changes of pregnancy and a pro-inﬂammatory state render the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome up to 10 times higher during pregnancy [56]. Cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic pul- monary oedema, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism and exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most common causes of acute breathless- ness during pregnancy. As the causes of acute respiratory failure in pregnancy are generally similar to those of the non-pregnant population, much of the literature regarding the non-obstetric population is probably applicable to pregnant women. In the general population, lung ultrasound has emerged as a standard tool for early diagnosis and treat- ment of acute respiratory failure, with a diagnostic accuracy superior to that of chest auscultation or radiogra- phy [57, 58]. Recognisable patterns include normal lung, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, interstitial syndrome and alveolar consolidation [59]. To perform a lung ultrasound examination, a low fre- quency probe is used (i.e. cardiac, abdominal or micro- convex). Longitudinal scans are preferred, as they are better at identifying the pleural line between the poste- rior shadowing of the superior and inferior ribs [60]. In the normal lung, the pleural line is identiﬁed as a hori- zontal hyperechoic sliding line. Beyond this pleural line, horizontal artefacts called A-lines are normally seen. In cases with interstitial disease (usually pulmonary oedema), the increased density of lung tissue creates reverberation artefacts called B-lines. B-lines are deﬁned as discrete laser-like vertical hyperechoic lines that start at the pleural line, extend to the bottom of the screen without fading and move synchronously with lung sliding [59]. Lichtenstein et al. have proposed a simpliﬁed lung ultrasound algorithm that correctly classiﬁes most (a) (b) Figure 3 Ultrasound views of a tracheal tube cuff (a) uninﬂated (b) inﬂated, with consequent tracheal dilation. © 2018 The Association of Anaesthetists 5 Zieleskiewicz et al. | Point-of-care ultrasound in obstetric anaesthesia Anaesthesia 2018 dyspnoeic adult patients who present in the emergency department. The algorithm creates three lung ultrasound proﬁles. Acute pulmonary oedema is strongly associated with anterior symmetrical bilateral B-lines (comet tail artefact, interstitial sonographic syndrome). An asymmet- rical proﬁle (unilateral interstitial disease or lung consoli- dation) suggests pneumonia. Acute dyspnoea with a normal lung ultrasound examination suggests a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism or bronchial disorder [60]. Lung ultrasound is very user-friendly. It is a sensitive tool for detecting community acquired pneumonia (non- speciﬁc focalised alveolar consolidation or B-lines) and cardiogenic causes of dyspnoea (anterior symmetric bilat- eral interstitial B-lines) [61–68]. However, in some cases, lung ultrasound does not differentiate between cardio- genic pulmonary oedema and non-cardiogenic pul- monary oedema due to pulmonary or extrapulmonary lesions. Interstitial bilateral pneumonias may also mimic the lung ultrasound ﬁndings of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, showing anterior symmetrical bilateral B-lines [69, 70]. Pulmonary embolism may sometimes present with an asymmetrical proﬁle with subpleural consolida- tion, particularly in case of pulmonary infarction [71–73]. Consequently, lung ultrasound should ideally be combined with echocardiography and venous ultrasound. The combined diagnostic approach has been shown to be highly successful, and superior to lung ultrasound alone [74–76]. In brief, if there is elevated left atrial ﬁlling pressure on echocardiography, the presence of anterior bilateral B-lines are associated with cardiogenic pul- monary oedema, whereas normal ﬁlling pressure and B-lines suggest non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, that is, acute respiratory distress syndrome. The presence of a deep venous thrombosis together with acute right ven- tricular failure implies pulmonary embolism. The use of point-of-care ultrasound is associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in time to correct diagnosis and treatment [77, 78]. Nevertheless, it does not decrease the Clinical examination Lung and pleural US Normal parenchyma B-lines Lung consolidation TTE and venous US TTE filling pressure + Pleural effusion Pneumothorax Pulmonary embolism Bronchial disorder Atelectasis Pneumonia Tamponade Pneumonia Cardiogenic oedema ARDS Figure 4 Algorithm for point-of-case ultrasound-guided differential diagnosis of acute respiratory failure during pregnancy.

Several recent publications have highlighted the potential of point-of-care ultrasound for managing acute respiratory failure during pregnancy. Arbeid et al. con- ﬁrmed that despite respiratory physiological changes, lung ultrasound remains normal during the last weeks of gesta- tion [79]. Inchingolo et al. demonstrated the superiority of lung ultrasound over conventional chest radiography in diagnosing retrocardiac consolidation due to pneumonia [80]. In 2012, we described the use of lung ultrasound to amend an erroneous clinical diagnosis of severe exacerba- tion of asthma in a pregnant woman; in fact she had pul- monary oedema secondary to undiagnosed pre-eclampsia [81]. Pachtman et al. demonstrated that bed-side lung ultrasound with an abdominal probe or an obstetric probe can detect anterior symmetrical B-lines, thereby distin- guishing bronchial disease from pulmonary oedema [82]. Elevated ﬁlling pressures, hypervolaemia and increased capillary permeability, associated with a low oncotic pressure and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, predis- pose women with pre-eclampsia to ﬂuid overload and pulmonary oedema [83]. Combined cardiac and lung ultrasound can be used to quantify extravascular lung water and ﬁlling pressure simultaneously [84–86]. We performed combined heart and lung ultrasound in a cohort of 20 pre- eclamptic women and 20 normal pregnant women. Women with severe pre-eclampsia had more anterior B-lines (i.e. increased extravascular lung water) compared with the control group. The amount of extravascular lung water cor- related with ﬁlling pressure, reﬂecting the mechanism of cardiogenic oedema during severe pre-eclampsia [87]. These ﬁndings have also been conﬁrmed by Ambrozic et al. [88]. Conversely, we described one case with tocolytic- induced pulmonary oedema, who had normal ﬁlling pressures but still had bilateral anterior B-lines and alter- ationofthe pleuralline, suggesting a non-cardiogenic mechanism [89]. Repeated assessment of anterior B-lines can also show real-time response to treatment of pulmonary oedema by non-invasive ventilation, diuretics or haemodialysis [81, 90–92]. In summary, in the non-obstetric population, there is an increasing body of literature supporting the use of point-of-care ultrasound for differential diagnosis and treatment of acute respiratory failure. Recent publications suggest that point-of-care ultrasound may equally be used in pregnant women. Figure 4 presents an algorithm for the diagnosis of acute dyspnoea during pregnancy using point-of-care ultrasound. Guidance of intravenous ﬂuid management Intravenous (i.v.) ﬂuid is often the initial therapy for acute circulatory failure in critically ill patients. However, although concerns regarding potential organ damage from hypoperfusion prompt early aggressive ﬂuid treat- ment [93], ﬂuid overload has been associated with an increase in patient morbidity and mortality [94–96]. Several international guidelines, therefore, recommend Clinical signs of hypoperfusion Assess fluid responsiveness: ∆VTI with PLR High ∆VTI (≥12%) Low ∆VTI (<12%) Fluid responsiveness unlikely Do not give i.v. fluid i.v. fluid bolus Reassess ∆VTI and B-lines after fluid administration Consider small volume i.v. fluid challenge Lung US: extravascular lung water assessment No symmetrical B-lines Symmetrical anterior B-lines Elevated ∆VTI witout B-lines Elevated ∆VTI with B-lines Figure 5 Algorithm for point-of-case ultrasound-guided ﬂuid management during pregnancy.

Fluid responsiveness is usually deﬁned as an increase in cardiac output > 15% after i.v. ﬂuid infusion. In the past, clinical signs and central venous pressure measurements, or other static indexes, were used to reach a conclusion. However, these are notoriously unreliable. More recently, several dynamic methods have been developed to test preload respon- siveness, by plotting the effect of a rapid change in venous return on cardiac output or its surrogates [99, 100]. Changes in venous return may be triggered by heart–lung interactions, end-expiratory occlusion in venti- lated patients, passive leg raising or a small ﬂuid chal- lenge. The consequences of variations in venous return may be monitored by measuring pulse pressure variation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, vena cava diameter or the velocity-time integral of subaortic blood ﬂow (VTI). However, many of these options cannot be used in patients whose tracheas are not intubated without inva- sive monitoring of arterial pressure. Respiratory variations in inferior vena cava diameter, and variation in VTI (ΔVTI) following passive leg raising, have both been extensively promoted for prediction of ﬂuid responsiveness in spon- taneously-breathing patients. However, the only one of these that has been well validated in this patient popula- tion is ΔVTI after passive leg raising [101, 102]. Studies of the relationship between inferior vena cava collapsibility and ﬂuid responsiveness in spontaneously-breathing patients have yielded controversial results [103–105]. Col- lapse of the inferior vena cava > 40–50% predicts ﬂuid responsiveness fairly well [104, 105]. However, inferior vena cava collapse is also associated with diaphragmatic motion, and therefore false positives may occur when inspiratory effort is increased [106]. Lack of collapsibility (< 50% collapse) precludes prediction of ﬂuid responsive- ness altogether [104, 105]. Of note, measurement during a standardised deep inspiration, followed by a passive expiration, maximises the predictive accuracy of inferior vena cava collapse for ﬂuid responsiveness [107]. During pregnancy, cardiac output rises secondary to an increase in stroke volume and heart rate. In parallel, peripheral vascular resistance decreases. Moreover, after the ﬁrst trimester, the enlarged uterus may cause inferior vena cava compression, thereby decreasing venous return [108]. As previously described, the physiological changes associated with pregnancy predispose to pulmonary oedema, particularly during severe pre-eclampsia [83]. Therefore, guided i.v. ﬂuid resuscitation is even more critical in pregnant women than it is in the general population. Few studies have assessed ﬂuid responsiveness speciﬁcally in pregnant women. V\u0003artun et al. showed that the physiological response to passive leg raising remains unaffected by pregnancy, thereby validating the use of ΔVTI in pregnant women [108]. During normal pregnancy, many women have a limited preload reserve, and thus do not increase cardiac output as a response to passive leg raising [109]. In 2013, we studied potential indicators of ﬂuid responsiveness in a cohort of 23 pregnant women with severe pre-eclampsia and oliguria. The ΔVTI was highly predictive of the response to i.v. ﬂuid loading, with a receiver operator characteristic area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.93 and a cut-off value of 12% [110]. A parti- tion algorithm combining baseline VTI and ΔVTI correctly classiﬁed 100% of the women. Inferior vena cava collapsi- bility was a poor predictor of ﬂuid responsiveness, with an AUC of 0.57. Interestingly, only 52% of the women were ﬂuid responsive, emphasising that oliguria is multi- factorial and that clinical signs are unreliable predictors of ﬂuid responsiveness in women with pre-eclampsia [110]. More recently, Ambrozic et al. conﬁrmed these ﬁndings; in their cohort only 14% of the women with severe pre-eclampsia were ﬂuid responsive [88]. In summary, ΔVTI, after passive leg raising, may be used to guide ﬂuid resuscitation, selecting only women who are most likely to beneﬁt from i.v. ﬂuid administra- tion by increasing cardiac output [110]. As noted above in the section on point-of-care ultra- sound and acute respiratory failure, the number of anterior B-lines observed during lung ultrasound examination directly correlates with extravascular lung water [84]. In the general population, Lichtenstein proposed that B-lines be used to guide ﬂuid resuscitation [111, 112]. Given the susceptibility of pregnant women to pulmonary oedema, direct evaluation of extravascular lung water may provide additional important information before ﬂuid administra- tion in this population. B-lines are associated with elevated ﬁlling pressures and a low ΔVTI in women with pre- eclampsia [87, 88]. Therefore, the presence or appearance of bilateral anterior B-lines should discourage ﬂuid admin- istration in the context of severe pre-eclampsia. Figure 5 presents an algorithm for guiding ﬂuid management during pregnancy using point-of-care ultrasound. Finally, point-of-care ultrasound may be used to guide ﬂuid therapy for the prevention of maternal hypotension after neuraxial anaesthesia for caesarean section. Neuraxial anaesthesia induces hypotension by vasodilation, with treatment usually based on ﬂuid preloading or coloading. Despite this practice, up to 70% of women still exhibit hypotension [113]. Point-of-care 8 © 2018 The Association of Anaesthetists Anaesthesia 2018 Zieleskiewicz et al. | Point-of-care ultrasound in obstetric anaesthesia ultrasound can be used to assess the likelihood of hypotension following neuraxial anaesthesia for elective caesarean section. A recent study showed that ΔVTI, fol- lowing passive leg raising, predicted occurrence of hypotension after spinal anaesthesia, with an AUC of 0.8. Ninety per cent of the women with a ΔVTI ≤ 8% had no hypotension, whereas 90% of those with a ΔVTI ≥ 21% became hypotensive [114]. Consequently, women with a high likelihood of hypotension could be identiﬁed a priori by point-of-care ultrasound, allowing the amount of ﬂuid administered to be individually targeted on a case- by-case basis. Guidance of treatment of shock A state of shock may be deﬁned as failure to maintain cardiac output or blood pressure at a level sufﬁcient to meet tissue oxygen demand, resulting in cellular dysfunc- tion [98]. Shock during pregnancy can occur secondary to progressive disease (infection, insidious blood loss, heart failure) or acute cardiovascular collapse (haemorrhage, thrombosis, myocardial infarction). In intensive and emer- gency medicine, bed-side point-of-care ultrasound can considerably affect the diagnosis and treatment of shock states [115, 116]. The impact of point-of-care ultrasound is particularly high in shock, since sonographic ﬁndings are easily apparent and often encountered [117–119]. The lit- erature abounds with ultrasound assessment protocols for patient assessment during shock and/or cardiac arrest (e.g. FATE, FEEL) [120, 121]. None of these have under- gone validation in the pregnant or peripartum popula- tions. Dennis et al. proposed an algorithm for assessing critically ill pregnant women, comprising a simple haemo- dynamic and fetal assessment [122, 123]. This ROSE algorithm (Rapid Obstetric Screening Echocardiography) is feasible and useful in clinical practice [123]. However, it does not include multi-modal ultrasound, such as venous or lung ultrasound, which is known to increase the diagnostic impact in cases of pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax [74, 76, 77]. In this section, we describe the use of point-of-care ultrasound for early diagnosis of shock during pregnancy. The main sonographic signs of the different kinds of shock are summarised in Table 1. Ruling out obstructive shock Pulmonary embolism is the most common cause of obstructive shock, affecting left ventricular ﬁlling, whereas the rarer problems of tension pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade affect right ventricular ﬁlling. Tension pneumothorax usually presents as rapidly deteriorating respiratory function, associated with asymmetrical ﬁndings upon clinical examination. In the absence of subcutaneous emphysema, point-of-care ultrasound is well validated and superior to chest X-ray for diagnosis of pneumothorax [57, 58]. Pneumothorax is described as an anterior abolition of lung sliding, with a horizontal A-line. Extending the ultrasound examination to the lateral regions of the chest wall can localise the point where normal lung sliding recurs (‘lung point’). Although the lung point is absent when complete lung collapse occurs, the presence of a lung point is pathognomonic of pneumothorax and should trigger immediate decompression in case of shock. Con- versely, the presence of anterior lung sliding or an intersti- tial sonographic syndrome (i.e. B-lines) conﬁrms that the parietal and the visceral layers of the pleura are in contact, thereby ruling out the diagnosis of pneumothorax [59]. Cardiac tamponade is deﬁned as an accumulation of pericardial ﬂuid, leading to cardiac chamber compres- sion [124]. Cardiac tamponade may be caused by spon- taneous pericardial effusion, aortic dissection or trauma. It occurs during pregnancy or peripartum due to the combination of hormone-induced changes in connective tissue and haemodynamic stress [125, 126]. Diagnosis is simple using a subcostal or parasternal long-axis view. Urgent surgical consultation should be sought if a cir- cumferential effusion > 1 cm, a swinging heart or right chamber compression is associated with shock. Pulmonary embolism may occur at any stage of pregnancy or the postpartum period. When pulmonary embolism is associated with shock, point-of-care ultra- sound will show signs of right ventricular dilation with ﬂattening or paradoxical septal motion. The preferred view for septal evaluation is a parasternal short-axis view, but a subcostal short-axis view may provide the same information. The ultrasound examination must also include an assessment of the venous system of the lower limbs in the femoral and popliteal areas, seeking incom- pressible veins or intraluminal material. A normal transthoracic echocardiographic examination, associated with normal lower limb ultrasonography and a pathologi- cal lung ultrasound examination, rule out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus [127, 128]. Conversely, ultrasound ﬁndings suggesting acute right ventricular failure, associ- ated with deep vein thrombosis, are 100% speciﬁc for pulmonary embolism [127, 128]. Ruling out cardiogenic shock Left ventricular function can be evaluated easily with echocardiography, using semi-quantitative visual estimation of a short-axis or apical 4-chamber view. © 2018 The Association of Anaesthetists 9 Zieleskiewicz et al. | Point-of-care ultrasound in obstetric anaesthesia Anaesthesia 2018 When compared with the gold standard of ventriculogra- phy, this method discriminates between low, altered and normal systolic function with a 7% rate of error [129–131]. Echocardiography should be used for haemody- namic assessment of pre-eclamptic patients [132]. Myocardial dysfunction may be related to peripartum cardiomyopathy or to late-stage pre-eclampsia-related heart failure, both during pregnancy and for an extended period afterwards [133, 134]. Myocardial infarction is a frequent cause of regional myocardial hypokinesia and can be associated with cardiogenic shock. The risk of myocardial infarction in the postpartum period is three times that of non-pregnant women [135]. Echocardiography is the cornerstone of diagnosis for regional wall motion abnormalities. Typical clinical and 12-lead ECG signs associated with regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities complete the diagnosis, enabling appropriate early management [136]. In cardiogenic shock, cardiac output should be moni- tored in order to verify treatment effects. Velocity-time integral is measured from the apical 4-chamber view using pulsed Doppler. VTI multiplied by the area of the aortic outﬂow tract equals stroke volume, and cardiac output is derived from the resultant value multiplied by heart rate. Velocity-time integral changes can be followed directly as an indicator of response to therapy with i.v. volume expansion or inotropes, provided the heart rate stays constant [129]. Assessment of left ventricular function is simpler using automatic strain evaluation with speckle-tracking echocardiography. Global longitudinal strain is more sen- sitive than left ventricular ejection fraction and is less operator dependent [137]. Future studies will determine the usefulness of this tool during pregnancy. Ruling out hypovolaemic and distributive shock Hypovolaemic shock in the peripartum period state should initially be assumed to result from haemorrhage, unless there are obvious signs of sepsis or severe dehydration. Point-of-care ultrasound can diagnose hypovolaemia even in the absence of obvious external bleeding. ‘Kissing heart’ (i.e. collapse of the mitral pillars during left ventricle systole), is a sensitive and easily detectable sign of hypovolaemia. It may be diagnosed via a parasternal short-axis view, and is associated with a very low diastolic ﬁlling volume of the left ventricle [129]. In major hypovolaemia, the subcostal longitudinal view may reveal a kissing heart associated with inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava. An inspiratory variation greater than 40% during spontaneous breathing, or an increase of > 12% in VTI after passive leg raising, are associated with i.v. ﬂuid responsiveness [104, 111]. Of note, VTI and cardiac output are usually low during hypovolaemic shock even when the left ventricular ejection fraction is preserved, due to a decrease in preload and an increase in afterload.

Fluid outside the pouch of Douglas should raise suspicion [138]. Bed-side abdominal ultrasound is speciﬁed in the French guidelines for management of suspected occult postpartum haemor- rhage [139]. Rarely, ultrasound may localise blood loss to the uterine cavity, associated with poor uterine contraction [2]. Distributive shock caused by sepsis or anaphylaxis may present similarly to hypovolaemic shock with kissing heart, inferior vena cava collapse and a normal or increased left ventricular ejection fraction. However, the decrease in after- load due to vasodilation leads to an increase in VTI and car- diac output. Therefore, normal or elevated VTI in association with the appropriate clinical context discrimi- nates between hypovolaemic and distributive shock. Echocardiography during cardiac arrest Current guidelines do not include a recommendation for point-of-care ultrasound during cardiopulmonary resusci- tation [140]. However, they do recommend identiﬁcation and treatment of reversible causes of cardiac arrest. Point- of-care ultrasound may have an important role in differenti- ating between causes of cardiac arrest during resuscitation, and in directing post-arrest care after return of sponta- neous circulation. The FEEL protocol for focused echocar- diographic evaluation in life support has been suggested to have a therapeutic impact of 78% [120, 121]. Conclusions An increasing body of evidence conﬁrms that point-of-care ultrasound has a high diagnostic and therapeutic impact for critically ill patients. Most of these ﬁndings can be extrapo- lated to the pregnant population. Recent speciﬁc studies on point-of-care ultrasound during pregnancy have conﬁrmed this, further emphasising the diagnostic importance of this tool when there is speciﬁc interest in minimising exposure to ionising radiation. Future studies should determine the direct impact of point-of-care ultrasound on maternal mor- bidity and mortality during pregnancy.
