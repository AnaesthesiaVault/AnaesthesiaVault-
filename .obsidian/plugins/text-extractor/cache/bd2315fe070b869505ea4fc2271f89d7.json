Ortner ⇑, C. Padilla, B. Carvalho Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA In high-income countries, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of maternal death, 1 and the incidence of postpartum hemor- rhage continues to increase.2 Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) has emerged as a valuable tool in the assessment of high-risk obstetric patients and women who experience bleeding or other complications during childbirth. The increasing burden in morbidity and obstetric critical illness over recent decades has led anesthesia experts to advo- cate for the use of POCUS on all high-acuity obstetric units.3 With the advent of smaller and more affordable ultrasound machines 4, the availability of ultrasound devices has increased, making POCUS no longer a skill conﬁned to cardiologists and radiologists.5 Point-of-care ultrasonography has become an effective tool for guiding invasive pro- cedures and supporting peri-operative decision making in all phases of clinical care and many settings. 6–7 Furthermore, focused cardiac ultra- sound (FCU) has been proven effective to guide volume resuscitation, assess cardiac contractility, identify gross valvular abnormalities or pericardial effusion.8 As a non-invasive diagnostic tool, POCUS offers a signiﬁcant potential beneﬁt in the obstetric environment where the clinical status of a previously healthy parturient can change rapidly and unexpectedly.9 Focused cardiac ultrasound is also useful on a labor and delivery ﬂoor (for example to identify the underlying source of acute dyspnea and arterial hypotension at the bedside) where cardiol- ogy or radiology consultations are rarely available after hours.8 The many beneﬁts and utility of POCUS and FCU are, however, dependent on the adequate training and expertise of clinicians.10 In 1989, a group of anesthesiologists in Denmark led by Dr. Erik Sloth, developed one of the ﬁrst POCUS courses and proposed the ‘focused assessed transthoracic protocol (FATE)’.11,12 Their courses are taught in over 55 countries worldwide, and combine electronical learning before undergoing a one-day hands-on tutorial followed by deﬁned practical clinical experience. In 2020, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the Emergency Care Research Institute identiﬁed the adoption of POCUS without necessary safeguards as a major health technology hazard, 13 emphasizing appro- priate quality assurance in POCUS implementation and caution to avoid harm due to misdiagnosis. The recent article in this journal by Brohan et al.14 describes the implementation of an institutional FCU course for obstetric anesthesi- ologists. The course consists of a reading assignment followed by a one-day, hands-on training course on image acquisition and interpre- tation. They used a 20-item multiple-choice questionnaire (MCQ) to assess knowledge and ability before and after the workshop (pre- and post-test), and again at three and six months after the course. Additionally, information regarding self-conﬁdence in data acquisition and interpretation was collected utilizing a 5-point Likert scale. Eight obstetric anesthesiologists, all POCUS novices, volunteered to partici- pate in this course as part of a divisional quality improvement (QI) pro- ject. Adequate knowledge was deﬁned as trainees achieving a MCQ score ≥80%, and results were compared with a control group of eight non-obstetric anesthesia providers with no prior FCU training who completed the MCQ without undergoing the FCU course. The FCU course participants achieved higher pre- and post-test MCQ scores of 90% and 95%, respectively compared with controls, who achieved a score of 56% (P=0.03). However, the MCQ scores of the FCU course participants decreased to 79% after six months and combined with their conﬁdence rating falling to a median [IQR] score of 2.5 [2–4] at six months from an initial post-workshop score of 3 [2–4], the authors concluded that the FCU course should be repeated at a six- month interval. The description of the FCU course by Brohan et al. and their expe- rience provides valuable insight into POCUS training implementation and knowledge assessment. However, the QI project has several limi- tations. The sample size is small and therefore conclusions need to be validated in a larger cohort. The authors outline that the results may reﬂect the memorization of identical MCQ test answers that were tested with each session, questioning the validity of this method in the assessment of competency or skill retention. The FCU trainees had achieved a pre-workshop MCQ score of 90%, indicating sufﬁcient knowledge before undergoing the workshop where image acquisition competence was taught. The generalizability of results will depend on the quality of the FCU course, supplemental educational material, and obstetric anesthesia clinical scenarios covered by the course such https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoa.2022.103545 Accepted 18 March 2022 0208-5216/© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite an emerging need for POCUS implementation among obstetric anes- thesiologists, the deﬁnition of a speciﬁc FCU curriculum fulﬁlling the requirements of anesthesia providers in a labor and delivery unit is not yet established. A decade ago, Dr. Alicia Dennis, an early pioneer advocating for the use of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in obstetric anesthesiology and critical care, deﬁned the ‘rapid obstetric screening echocardiography (ROSE-scan)’ as an obstetric-speciﬁc FCU protocol which included the assessment of the fetal heart. 9 It has been implemented by several experts, but a clear curriculum under the guidance of societies in obstetric anesthesiology is still warranted. Deﬁning subspecialty-speciﬁc learning topics and goals may further help facilitate efﬁcient and effective training. The observation that MCQ scores and trainees’ reported conﬁdence level in performing a FCU decreased over time reveals one of the most important challenges regarding cardiac ultrasound training and ser- vice implementation: how to ensure ongoing learning and regular adoption of FCU in daily clinical practice. With novices practising FCU scanning and image interpretation under appropriate guidance and supervision during routine clinical practice, competency, knowl- edge, and performance indicators should increase, not decrease, over time. We cannot emphasize enough that the most important part of FCU training is ongoing scanning in routine clinical practice and under appropriate supervision. Major national and international echocardio- graphy training guidelines list theoretical learning modules and hands- on training as an initial step in diagnostic cardiac ultrasound training.15 Certiﬁcation consistently requires continuous image interpretation training, a deﬁned number of ultrasound procedures performed by the trainee paralleled by a quality assessment process assuring ade- quate image acquisition and interpretation. The number of TTE scans depends upon certiﬁcation level,16 and ranges from 40 to 300. Theo- retical contents tested in a certiﬁcation exam vary and are based upon the required level of competency of trainees. Although FCU represents only a most basic competency level, training implementation remains a difﬁcult task. To overcome training barriers, several educational resources and tools have become available in recent years to support successful training and FCU implementation. In concert with multiple specialties that use POCUS in clinical practice, the American Society of Echocardiography recognizes the challenge of POCUS training and rec- ommends that both cardiologists and sonographers help facilitate the education and direct training of clinicians who perform cardiac ultra- sonography. 17 Low-cost ultrasound systems that connect by wireless technology to hospital networks and cloud-based systems allow video conferencing and peer review of acquired FCU images for ongoing mentoring and clinical training. 18 The integration of artiﬁcial intelli- gence in supporting practitioners in POCUS image acquisition and interpretation is also an area of development and research that will contribute to FCU training and quality assurance. 19–20 Using artiﬁcial intelligence to guide image acquisition, one recent study showed that novice POCUS operators were able to obtain a 10-view echocardio- graphic image set that was similar in quality to that obtained by skilled cardiac sonographers. 21 Certiﬁcation bodies offering different training pathways to accommodate individual needs in the environment of the individual learner should also further facilitate practice training. Leading obstetric societies have recently adopted ultrasonography curriculums into their respective domains. The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM) and the Society for Obstetric Anesthesiology and Perinatology (SOAP) now offer ‘hands-on’ POCUS training mod- ules with an obstetric focus for their respective society members. 22 In the UK, the Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Conﬁdential Enquiries across the UK (MMBRACE UK) collabora- tive, a national organization investigating causes of maternal death, recognizes the limited cardiac echocardiogram as “the gold standard of care for a woman with severe cardiovascular instability or compro- mise”.23 Despite these recommendations, the authors acknowledge that a signiﬁcant limitation of implementation of TTE is training and the widespread availability of this skill set.23 We are encouraged by the work shared by Brohan J. et al. in their efforts to standardize the quality of FCU implementation in the obstet- ric setting. 14 We hope this and other studies outlined in this editorial inspire POCUS educators to take the next steps in introducing POCUS and FCU into routine clinical practice. An increasingly complex obstet- ric patient population, and an escalating burden of cardiovascular dis- ease in pregnancy, ultimately demands standardization of echocardiography skills. As echocardiography curricula become wide- spread, training programs and quality assurance in their application are essential, so that this valuable tool can be adequately implemented to assess high-risk obstetric patients and women who experience hem- orrhage or other peripartum complications.
