In the critically ill patient, red cell transfusion has been used to increase oxygen delivery and tissue oxygenation; 37-45% of ICU patients receive 21 unit of packed red cells. However, although red cell transfusions lead to an increase in oxygen content, there is little evidence that transfusions cause a significant improvement in oxygen delivery (DO,)} or oxygen utilisation. Autologous, stored red cells are very different from circulating red cells. The autologous cells are stiff and poorly deformable and pass through the microcirculation with difficulty. There is no evidence that blood transfusion improves tissue hypoxia, and may, in fact, worsen it. Red cell transfusion is associated with a host of complications such as infection, transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), and transfusion-mediated immunomodulation {TRIM) to name but a few! There is proof that patients who received red cell transfusions as neonates, still have immunological evidence of the transfusion 30 years later! ) Transfusion trials Critically lll The first big trial to raise the question of transfusion requirements in the critically ill was the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care {TRICC) trial (Hébert 1999). This was a randomised controlied trial of 838 euvolaemic patients who were not actively bleeding but had a haemoglobin (Hb) <9g/dL within 72 hours of admission to ICU. Non-leucodepleted blood was transfused in all patients. e Theliberal transfusion arm was transfused if the Hb <10g/dL, to maintain an Hb of 10-12g/dL ¢ Therestrictive transfusion arm was transfused when the Hb <7g/dL, to maintain an Hb of 7-9g/dL. There was a trend to lower 30-day mortality in the restrictive group compared to the liberal transfusion arm [18.7% vs. 23.2% p=0.11]. Statistically significant secondary findings included: * Areduction in mortality with the restrictive strategy in patients who were less sick (APACHE 2 scores <20) [8.7% vs. 16.1% p=0.03], * Areduction in mortality of younger patients (<55 years of age) with the restrictive strategy [5.7% vs. 13.0% p=0.02] e There was also a lower in-hospital mortality in the restrictive group [22.2% vs. 28.1% p=0.05]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
