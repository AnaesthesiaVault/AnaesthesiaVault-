However, oxygen can also be highly toxic — it is one of the strongest oxidising agents and has the ability to damage biological molecules. Hyperoxia leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals; there is also a reduction in the bioavailability of nitric oxide and prostaglandin 1,, with the consequence of vasoconstriction and a reduction in tissue perfusion. It has been recognised for many years that oxygen can be harmful to various organ systems. A quote by Severinghaus and Astrup over 30 years ago stated: \"if introduced today, oxygen might have difficulty getting approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\"[sic]. Definitions The term hyperoxia refers to an excess of oxygen supply (F,0, more than 0.21). Normoxaemia is usually defined as a p,0, range between 80-100mmHg (10.6-13.3kPa) when breathing room air at sea level. Hyperoxaemia is an elevated p,0, (sometimes referred to as arterial hyperoxia). Therefore, a p,0, >13.3kPa (100mmHg} constitutes hyperoxaemial However, there is no consensus in the literature as to the definition of hyperoxaemia. The levels of hyperoxaemia vary between clinical studies, although most agree that extreme hyperoxaemia is a p,0; 240kPa (300mmHg) - but there is no physiological basis to use this as a cut off. The terms hyperoxia and hyperoxaemia are often, incorrectly, used interchangeably. Probably both are harmful - for example, when the lungs are exposed to hyperoxia it is the exposure to a high F,0, which causes inflammation, oxidative stress, and absorption atelectasis; thus, hyperoxia is probably more important in direct lung toxicity. However, hyperoxaemia may be more relevant (and harmful) in other organ systems. It is difficult to tease out the harm attributable to hypoxia, and that caused by hyperoxaemia as clinical situations in which normobaric hyperoxaemia occurs in the absence of hyperoxia are rare. Veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation {V-V ECMO) might help to separate the effects of systemic hyperoxaemia and alveolar hyperoxia since it avoids the occurrence of hyperoxia. Indeed, studies show an association between hyperoxaemia and mortality in V-V ECMO that is not attributable to alveolar hyperoxia. Therefore, hyperoxaemia is harmful, and not just because it is induced by hyperoxia. Hyperoxaemia Although much of the research of hyperoxaemia has focussed on pulmonary pathology, hyperoxaemia / hyperoxia has demonstrated to be harmful in several organ systems and clinical scenarios: a) Microvasculature Hyperoxia induces vasoconstriction may alter microvascular perfusion. This may partly be the basis of other organ dysfunctions seen in hyperoxic situations. b) Lungs","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
