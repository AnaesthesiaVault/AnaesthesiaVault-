Where, Driving pressure = plateau pressure — PEEP Driving pressure (Pyq,) reflects the compliance of the respiratory system and is related to the end-expiratory volume. Intraoperative Py, is associated with the development of postoperative pulmonary complications. For each 1 unit increase in Py, there is an odds ratio of harm of 1.16 (95%Cl 1.12-1.19 p<0.0001); yet no association was found between intraoperative V; and the development of PPCs. When lungs are compliant, increasing the PEEP does not necessarily cause an increase in Pyq,. However, if an increase in PEEP leads to an increase in Py, then this is associated with an increased risk of developing postoperative pulmonary complications (OR 3.11; 95%Cl 1.39-6.96; p=0.006). 3. Use of higher PEEP ARDSnet demonstrated the utility of PEEP (and also described the use of higher PEEP than was originally believed to be necessary) in preventing lung injury in critically ill patients with ALl and ARDS. PEEP is commonly described as a method to “stabilise alveoli” — this is a simplistic view on how it minimises the repetitive, cyclical opening and closing of alveoli which can cause atelectrauma, The correct level of PEEP varies from patient to patient and between disease processes. Too high levels of PEEP may cause over-distension (and increase the Pyy, and may reduce cardiac output, however, higher PEEP might negate the atelectasis caused by low V; ventilatory strategies. Too low levels of PEEP may increase the risk of intra-tidal recruitment and de-recruitment and cause atelectrauma. What is the role of PEEP in ventilating healthy lungs? The PROtective Ventilation using High vs. LO PEEP (PROVHILO trial, PROVE Network — 2014) studies patients deemed to be intermediate or high risk for PPCs. The patients all received V; of 8mi/kg and either PEEP of 12cmH,0 and RM or PEEP of 2cmH,0 without RM. They found that there was no difference between the 2 groups with respect to PPCs in the first 5 days postoperatively. The group with lower PEEP had more episodes of desaturation and the group with higher PEEP had more episodes of hypotension. This led the PROVE Network to recommend that low levels of PEEP {2emH,0), low tidal volumes (6-7mi/kg) and the avoidance RM should be implemented intraoperatively. They also stated that high PEEP is probably only beneficial in severe ARDS. The PROVHILO study lends support to the benefits associated with P4, — namely that increasing PEEP can be detrimental, especially if lung compliance worsens and Pq,y increases (even though gas exchange may improve). It also suggests that high PEEP is not a major factor behind intraoperative lung protective ventilation.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
