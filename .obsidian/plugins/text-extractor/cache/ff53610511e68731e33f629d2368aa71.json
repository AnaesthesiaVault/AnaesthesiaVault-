{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20231114202401.png","text":"Physiology Vomiting is integrated by the vomiting centre, located in the dorsal part of the lateral reticular formation in the medulla oblongata. The vomiting centre contains predominately acetylcholine (ACh) receptors, with some histamine (H , ) receptors. It receives input from the cerebral cortex, chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). The cerebral cortex receives afferent CNS input from pathways mediating pain, smell, sight, emotion (fear/anxiety), and organic disturbances. The CTZ is functionally located outside the blood-brain barrier on the floor of the fourth ventricle in the area postrema. It contains serotonin (SHT , ) and dopamine receptors. It receives input from the vestibular apparatus, which contains H , and ACh receptors. The NTS contains 5HT 4 receptors, and receives input from the gastrointestinal tract stretch and chemoreceptors. The efferent pathways are carried by the vagus, hypoglossal, glossopharyngeal, trigeminal, and facial nerves to the stomach and via the spinal nerves to the diaphragm and abdominal muscles.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
