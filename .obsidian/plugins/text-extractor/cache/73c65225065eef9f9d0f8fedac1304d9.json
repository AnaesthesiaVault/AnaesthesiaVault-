Limiting tidal volume Since 2013 there have been 3 randomised controlled trials showing benefit of lower V; in patients with normal lungs ¢ Single centre study of patients undergoing abdominal surgery This study randomised patients to receive 7mi/kg V; with 10cmH,0 PEEP plus recruitment manoeuvres vs. 9ml/kg Vr and zero PEEP (zEEP) ® Multicentre randomised controlled trial in abdominal surgery (IMPROVE trial) Here, patients received V; 6-8ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW) with PEEP 6-8cmH,0 and RM every 30 minutes vs. Vy 10-12ml/kg PBW, zEEP and no RM * Single centre study in patients for spinal fusion The patients were randomised to receive V; 6ml/kg PBW with PEEP 10cmH20 vs. V; 10-12ml/kg and zEEP. The problem with the above studies, is that the groups who were randomised to receive higher Vy ALL received injurious ventilation because they all received zEEP. It is well described that positive pressure ventilation with zero PEEP causes lung damage. This begs the question, are the perceived benefits from low V1, or is the worse outcome in the high V; group partly due to the zEEP. One cannot conclude from these 3 studies that the benefit came from limiting Vy, it may well be that zEEP contributed largely to the lung injury. However, please don’t think that this, in any way, means that high tidal volumes are not harmful — they most certainly are, especially when they cause an increase in plateau pressures or driving pressure (see below). 2. Limiting plateau pressures ARDSnet recommends that plateau pressure should not exceed 30cmH,0, as the risk of barotrauma increases once this threshold is reached.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
