{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240214122756.png","text":"A meta-analysis (Salpeter 2014}, which only included 3 trials out of 4500 screened, concluded that, in critically ill or bleeding patients, targeting an Hb <7g/dL reduced pulmonary oedema, acute coronary syndrome, rebleeding, bacterial infection, in-hospital mortality and total mortality. However, they found that less restrictive strategies (e.g. Hb <8.5g/dL) were not associated with benefit. Other studies looking at specific subgroups of patients have demonstrated benefit with restrictive strategies in cancer patients and in patients with traumatic brain injury. Although some of the studies above do not demonstrate a benefit (or a mortality benefit) with restrictive transfusion triggers, they all show that a restrictive trigger is not harmful. Since red blood cell transfusions are undoubtedly life-saving in severe anaemia and bleeding, and since blood is an expensive and scare resource, it makes sense that blood transfusions should be reserved for situations in which they do have a positive impact.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
