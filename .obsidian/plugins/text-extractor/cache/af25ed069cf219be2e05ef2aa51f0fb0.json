If the heart s being taken for transplant the cardiac surgeons prefer as low dose of inotrope as possible to be used and prefer fluid administration as a means of raising the pressure. This may conflict with the preferences of the liver surgeons. 2) Pulmonary: Avoid pulmonary derecruitment and ventilator induced lung injury. Avoid high Fio2. Use low tidal volumes (4 8 mls/kg) with PEEP < 10 cm H20. Keep inspiratory pressures as low as possible. 3) Renal: Central diabetes insipidus is common and contributes to hypovolaemia. It is advocated to treat with DDAVP (1 -4 meg 6 - 8 hourly ivi) when urine output > 4mis/kg/hr. Keep urine output at > 0.5 mi/kg/hr 4) Haematologic: DIC may complicate brain death and coagulopathy must be corrected particularly if active bleeding oceurs. ‘The optimal Hb concentration is not known but is thought to be 7.0~ 10.0 g/DI. Endocrine: Maintain body temperature in the face of the poikilothermia that follows disruption of hypothalamic thermoregulation. Keep blood glucose at < 10.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
