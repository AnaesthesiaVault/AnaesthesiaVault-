Reduced myocardial contractility. Leaky endothelium {edema). PRR + DAMPs activate nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB), Fever (alters hypothalamic set point). Innate Immune System upregulating transcription of TNF-a and IL-1, leading to: . Leukocytosis. Activation of the clotting pathway, leading to consumption of clotting factors and DIC. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) produces nitric oxide, causing hypotension. Intracellular and vascular adhesion molecules (iCAM and iVAM) enable granulocytes to adhere to the endothelium. Stress Res onse ADH: V1 causes vasoconstriction of the splanchnic bed; p V2 causes water retention. ACTH: Stimulates cortisol, increasing glucose levels (glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis), fatty acid metabolism, and immunosuppression {inhibits NFKB and Pituitary leukocytes). GH: Limits protein breakdown, promotes lipolysis and glycogenolysis. TSH: Risk of fall. Prolactin: Has immune-modulating effects. Increases cardiac output {increased contractility and heart rate). .

RAAS activation leads to water retention (aldosterone) and splanchnic vasoconstriction (angiotensin I1). Made with <ยง Whimsical","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
