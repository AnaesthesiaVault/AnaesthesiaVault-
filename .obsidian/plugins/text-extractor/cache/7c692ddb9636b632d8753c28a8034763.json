Decompensated shock is associated with >50% mortality. Note: ‘pure’ haemorrhagic shock is unusual. Haemorrhage usually occurs in conjunction with trauma. Following trauma, tissue damage triggers a cascade of inflammatory mediators, resulting in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ dysfunction, further increasing mortality.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
