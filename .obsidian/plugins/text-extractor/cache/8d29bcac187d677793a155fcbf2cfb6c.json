Parasympathetic innervation (which slows the heart) s functional, while the Sympathetic system (which increases heart rate and contractilty) is not. The neonatal heart has fewer contractile elements, with limited ability to increase stroke volume (SV) and difficulty in maintaining cardiac output (CO) with an increase in afterload. They also have reduced compliance due to deficiency of elastic elements. The LV : RV mass of 2 : 1 (in response to change in resistance, once the foetal circulation has ceased fo exist) occurs only several months after birth. The neonatal heart has fewer mitochondria and less cytoplasmic reticula and depends on extracellular calcium for contraction, however, it is more tolerant to ischaemia and recovers rapidly after an ischaemic event.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
