Schweickert WD et al (Lancet 2009; 373(9678):1874-1882) demonstrated that early mobilisation reduced ICU delirium. The early mobilisationgroup had a median of 2 days of delirium, compared to 4 days in control group (p=0.03). Morris PE and co- workers (JAMA 2016; 315(24):2694-2702) failed to find any difference in the incidence of delirium between patients with and without early mobilisation. The latest Cochrane group collaboration suggests that there is insufficient evidence on the effect of early mobilisation in the critically ill, with respect to impact on physical function or performance, adverse events, muscle strength or health- related Quality of Life (Doiron KA et al — Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2018). * F-FAMILY engagement and empowerment (participation in multidisciplinary rounds, cognitive stimulation and participation in mobilisation).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
