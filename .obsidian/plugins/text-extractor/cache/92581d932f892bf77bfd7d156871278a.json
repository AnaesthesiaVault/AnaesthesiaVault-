Lawson v~ [y | Cteseriwon uniione BReEE — ==l Left ventricular assist devices (LVADS) are semi-permanent hemodynamic sssTED RS B Support devices implanted in end-stage heart failure. LVADS are surgically implanted intrathoracily or intraabdominally. Several models existincluding LA MPLANTED : Heartmate 2/3 (Abbott), HVAD (Medtronic).
