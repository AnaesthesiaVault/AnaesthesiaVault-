Extracellular adenosine signaling and its termination: In inflammatory condiftions, extracellular adenosine is derived predorminantly from the enzymatic conversion of the precursor nucleotides adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine di- phosphate (ADP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) through the enzymatic activity of the ectonucleoside triphosphate di- phosphohydrolase 1 (CD39) and the subsequent conversion of AMP to adenosine through ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73). Ex- tracellular adenosine can signal through four distinct adenosine receptors: ADORAT (A1), ADORA2A (A2A), ADORA2B (A28), and ADORA3 (A3). An example of the functional role of extracellular adenosine signaling is Al-receptor activation during intravenous administration of adenosine for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia. In addition, experimental studies implicate activation of A2A that is expressed on inflammatory cells such as neutrophils'® or lymphocytes in the attenuation of inflammation. 112 Other experimental studies provide evidence of signaling events through A28 in tissue adaptation to hy- poxia and attenuation of ischemia and reperfusion..% A clinical trial has shown that an oral agonist of the A3 adenosine re- ceptor may be useful in the treatment of the dry-eye syndrome. ® Adenosine signaling is terminated by adenosine uptake from the extracellular space toward the intracellular space, predominantly through equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2), followed by metabolism of adenosine to AMP through the adenosine kinase or toinosine through the adenosine deaminase. Blockade of equilibrative nucleoside transporters by dipyridamole is associated with increased extracellular adenosine concentrations and signaling (e.g., during pharmacologic stress echocardiography of in protection of tissue from ischemia).
