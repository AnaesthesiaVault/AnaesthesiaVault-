{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240105160423.png","text":"Neuraxial anaesthesia The cooling patterns observed under general anaesthesia differ when neuraxial blockade is administered. The rapid decrease in core temperature is still observed, but under neuraxial blockade this redistribution is because of peripheral inhibition of tonic vasoconstriction (rather than central as seen under general anaesthesia). The rapid decrease in temperature may not be as precipitous as that occurring under general anaesthesia because the redistribution is confined to the lower half of the body (usually), and the initial core hypothermia tend to be more modest — about 0.5°C drop (See Figure 5). Under neuraxial blockade, hypothermia tends to progress and the thermal steady state / plateau does not occur. The mechanism for the thermal steady state is triggered vasoconstriction, which, under neuraxial blockade, is only able to occur cephalad to the block, and is insufficient to counterbalance the effects of vasodilatation below the level of the block. The legs constitute the bulk of the thermal compartment, thus an effective plateau cannot occur without vasoconstriction in the legs. Patients with a combination of general anaesthesia and neuraxial blockade are more likely to be at risk of developing hypothermia (see Figure 5). Consequently, core temperature menitoring is especially important if a combination of these techniques is administered. 370 N\\, \\ . .0 \\\\ 3 ss T 5 \\ Eipidural/spinal alone 2 N 2 Se T 3 el T R GA Combined GA -+ epidural 1 2 3 Time (h) Figure 5.
