Marked mechanosensitivity associated with chronic nerve compression. Short-circuits between pain fibers and other types of fibers following demyelination, resulting in activation of nociceptive fibers by nonnoxious stimuli at the site of injury (ephaptic transmission). Functional reorganization of receptive fields in dorsal horn neurons such that sensory input from surrounding intact nerves emphasizes or intensifies any input from the area of injury. Spontaneous electrical activity in dorsal horn cells or thalamic nuclei. Release of segmental inhibition in the spinal cord. Loss of descending inhibitory influences that are dependent on normal sensory input. Lesions of the thalamus or other supraspinal structures.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
