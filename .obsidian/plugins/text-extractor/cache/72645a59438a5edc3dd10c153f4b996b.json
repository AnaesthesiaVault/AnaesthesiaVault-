Ensure that you are trained in use of the chosen pump and pharmacokinetic model 3. Ensure the pumps have been serviced in the past 12 months 4.Ensure the pumps are plugged into the mains 5. Ensure the batteries are charged 6.Ensure that the drug dilutions are correct and are entered correctly into the pump 7. Ensure that the correct syringe type and size data are entered and that the syringes are mounted correctly 8.Ensure that the pump is programmed for the drug actually attached to it 9.Ensure that the low and high infusion pressure alarms are set (to wam of disconnection and a ‘tissued cannula, respectively) 10. Ensure that the correct patient data are entered 11. Consider if the targets set are appropriate to the patient's age and ASA status 12. What is plan B if the pumpf(s) fail? Table 5 Recommendations for preventing technical problems with TIVA 1.Complete the TCI system checklist 2. Affix the i.v. cannula firmly to the patient’s skin 3.Keep thessite of TIVA infusion visible so that disconnection, leakage, or a ‘tissued’ cannula are readily detected 4.Use only a dedicated two- or three-way TIVA set which incorporates « anti-siphon valves on the drug administration lines * non-return valve on any i.v. fluid line * minimal dead space distal to the point of agent and/or i.v. fluid mixing 5. Use only Luer lock syringes for administering drugs 6.0 notlabel the remifentanil syringe until the drug has been added to the diluent 7. Always check the infusion site if a pump alarms (except ‘syringe empty’, ‘infusion paused’, or ‘mains failure’) 8. Flush TIVA drugs from the dead space of a three-way administration setbefore connection to the patient cannula, and out of the cannula at the end of the case","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
