Different perceptions of this mode may exist around the globe. While 'APRV' is common to users in North America, a very similar mode, biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP), was introduced in Europe. Essentially, APRV has a longer time phase on the high pressure level, while BIPAP usually does not exceed an inspiration:expiration (I:E) time ratio of 1:1. Other names (BILEVEL, DUOPAP) have been created for legal reasons by other manufacturers. The ventilator delivers two levels of positive airway pressure for pre- set periods of time. In pure APRV this is in the form of a severe inverse I:E ratio with a long inspiratory time and a short expiratory time. The patient is able to take spontaneous breaths at both high and low levels and these spontaneous breaths can be assisted as well. (See diagram below)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
