Exam: Airway (h/o difficultintubation, ifficulty with bag/mask ventilation); Neuro (current mental status, evidence of CVA, prior embolic strokel; Cardiac (current status of pump, implantation date, current EF, h/o difficulties with VAD, additional batteries present, current physical activity level) Pulmonary (recent changes in Oxygen requirements, pulmonary HTN, preexisting COPD); Hepatic (evidence of failure, engorgement, coagulopathies); Renal (changes in Crlevels, GFR, dialyss requirements); Endocrine (glycemic control); Hematology (anemia, current anticoagulation use, duration of anticoagulation use, recent Iab testing); Infection (blood borne diseases with h/o transfusion, UTI, preumonia with decreased activity); 'VAD Specific (pump speed, flow, pulse index, motor power, driveline status, abdominal wall) Anaesthetic considerations and goals Airway: 2 gen: “ful stomach” 2% gen: normal Induction agents must account for: Unassisted RV + prior njury to other major organs Continuous hasmodynamic optimization with luid adjustments, inotropes and vasoactive agents = mandatory Monitoring: Standard monitors + TEE/PAC 'VADs do not operate on the Stariing curve and will only pump the volume delivered to it Therefore, those factors that can decrease Preload willdirctly affect pump flow and decrease output. These can include: drugs, dehydration, hemorrhage, lateral decubitus, increased abdominal pressures (insuffiation), and bed position. Cardiac arrest: similar to normal with ACLS principles except: Cardioversion: don't place pads directly over device Compressions: evaluate in moment (dislodgement of cannula may cause certain death) Post-op analgesia NB to avoid hypertension/tachycardia -> increase afterload and not too sedated -> PHT -> decreased preload Goals: Full (preload, reduce pulmonary pressures), not fast, forward (reduce afterload)!
