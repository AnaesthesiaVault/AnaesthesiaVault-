Medication Management: Stop ACE inhibitors if the patient is on them. Invasive: Arterial line, central venous pressure {CVP), transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE} if indicated {e.g., cardiomyopathy)}. Monitoring Non—lnvas?ve: Cardialc output {CO) monitoring, depth of anaesthesia monitoring. Systemic Vascular Resistance {(SVR}): Formula - SVR = 80 x {MAP - RAP) / CO.Normal range: 800-1200 dynes.sec.cm”-5. Laparoscopic: Midline, subcostal, retroperitoneal {renal Positioning _< position: lateral jack knife position). Open Surgery: Occasionally performed. IV Lines: Wide bore. Intravenous Access -< Fluid Warming: High flow fluid warming devices in case of haemorrhage. Blood Management Cross-Match: Due to very vascular tumors near highly /- vascular organs or around vessels. # Conduct of Anaesthesia = Premedication Midazolam IV: To allay anxiety during arterial line \\ placement. Fluid Management Volume Staltuls: Often volume depleted due to chronic vasoconstriction. Hypertensive Episode (Phase 1): During stimuli such as intubation, insufflation, and tumor manipulation. Ensure good analgesia and depth of anaesthesia, blunt intubation response. . . Hypotensive Episode (Phase 2): After cl i ffluent Critical Intraoperative Events ypolensive EpIso e (Phase 2): After clamping effluen vein. Vasopressor support often needed. Agents: phenylephrine (PEP), noradrenaline {NA), adrenaline, and vasopressin. Volume Replacement: Ensure adequate volume replacement and blood products. Open Procedures: Epidural can be placed and activated Analgesia < postoperatively. Morphine: Administer slowly to avoid histamine release. Blood Sugar Management === |nsulin Resistance: Catecholamine-induced. Steroid Supplementation Bilateral Adrerfalectomy: Requires hydrocortisone supplementation. ICU Admission: If any untoward events occur intraoperatively. Postoperative Care PACHU: Post-Anaesthesia Care Unit for routine postoperative care.
