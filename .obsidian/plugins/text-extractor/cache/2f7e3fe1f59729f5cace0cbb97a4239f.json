Treat evidence of expiratory airflow obstruction. Treat respiratory infection with antibiotics. Initiate patient education regarding lung volume expansion ma- neuvers. INTRAOPERATIVE Use minimally invasive surgery (endoscopic) techniques when possible. Consider regional anesthesia. Avoid surgical procedures likely to last longer than 3 hours. POSTOPERATIVE Institute lung volume expansion maneuvers (voluntary deep breathing, incentive spirometry, continuous positive airway pressure). Maximize analgesia (neuraxial opioids, intercostal nerve blocks, patient-controlled analgesia).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
