RMs achieve recruitment, but PEEP is required to maintain the alveoli in an open state. Concerns around the use of RMs is that the application of sustained pressure to open poorly aerated areas can overdistend the normal areas of lung. Although the routine use of RM has been proposed to prevent PPCs, there is little evidence to support its use and it should probably be reserved for use as a rescue manoeuvre to overcome atelectasis. Putting it all together... VILI can occur in healthy lungs and occurs due to the mechanical concepts of stress and strain. Large Vy, zEEP, high F,0,, high Pqg, all contribute to lung damage. Intraoperative lung protective ventilatory strategies have not yet been fully defined. What we can conclude is: e There is consensus with regards to Vi — this should be limited to 6ml/kg PBW (and this should be applied to ALL patients), o Pgyisanimportant concept and should be limited to 14cmH,0 e High PEEP and RMs are more controversial ® PEEPis harmfut if it translates to an increase in Pyq,","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
