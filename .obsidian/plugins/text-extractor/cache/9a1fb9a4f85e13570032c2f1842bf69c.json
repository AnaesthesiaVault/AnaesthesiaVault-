Regulatory T-cells are a subpopulation of immuno-modulatory T-cells characterized by expression of the cell surface molecules cluster of differentiation (CD)4 and CD25, and by the presence of the transcription fac- tor forkhead box P3 (FoxP3). Binding of interleukin (IL)-2 to CD25 induces proliferation of regulatory T-cells and is required to ensure their physiologic maintenance.*® FoxP3 expression is induced under hypoxic conditions and regulates target genes that govern immuno-modulatory functions.*® Neuroprotective effects are mediated by regulatory augmentation of T-cell proliferation and activity as well as by synthesis of antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-10% and transforming growth factor (TGF)-B.%\" Therapeutic activation of regulatory T-cells has been successfully achieved through exogenous administration of IL-2 in clini- cal trials of primarily nonneurologic diseases.'%2 This approach may serve as a model for studying neuroprotective effects of regulatory T-cells in perioperative stroke.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
