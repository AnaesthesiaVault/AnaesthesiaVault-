HFOV utilises an oscillating diaphragm at high frequencies to create pressure swings within the airway, which leads to CO2 elimination. This form of ventilation uses a relatively high mean airway pressure. This may sustain lung recruitment more effectively than levels of positive end-expiratory pressure that are typically used during conventional ventilation. Gas transport is thought to occur via a number of convective and diffusive mechanisms. In addition, there is asynchronous filling of adjacent alveolar spaces {termed pendelluft) due to different alveolar-emptying times, collateral ventilation through non-airway connections between neighbouring alveoli, and cardiogenic mixing. The figure below depicts the pressure-time curves of conventional pressure control ventilation (PCV) as well as that of HFOV.
