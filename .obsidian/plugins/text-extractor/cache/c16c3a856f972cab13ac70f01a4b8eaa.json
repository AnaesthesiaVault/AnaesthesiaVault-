(1) Related: the donor is genetically related to the recipient (parent, child, sibling, half-sibling, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, first cousin). (2) Paired: when a donor agrees to give one of their healthy kidneys to a known recipient, the donor and recipient will be assessed to find out if they are suitable for an exchange. In some cases, the donor and recipients’ blood groups or tissue types are mismatched or incompatible. If 50, as a pair, they can be put forward for ‘paired donation’, where they will be matched up with another donor and recipient in the same situation. (3) Pooled: occasionally, more than two donors and two recipients will be involved in a swap. Each recipient gains from a transplant that they would not otherwise have had. The donors might not have given their kidney to the person they know, but that person will have received a kidney from one of the other pooled donors.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
