Ventilation requires a transpulmonary pressure (P} to create a gradient down which the air can flow. The P, can be achieved by either positive pressure ventilation (where the airway / plateau pressure increases) of by negative pressure ventilation {where the pleural pressure is lowered), both of which will raise the transpulmonary pressure gradient, and cause flow. High plateau pressures and / or low pleural pressures increase the transpulmonary pressure which stresses the lung parenchyma and causes VILI. Transpulmonary pressures vary widely across different regions of the lung because they are influenced by factors such as lung elastic recoil, chest wall compliance, intraabdominal pressure, gravity, lung areas with altered compliance etc. Shearing forces are a form of mechanical stress, and arise when neighbouring pockets of lung parenchyma with differing compliance, and different anchoring attachments, move together in inspiration. To simplify this, think of the 2 different lung units as neighbouring alveoli: obviously, the stiffer alveoli will not fully inflate, and the healthy alveoli may overdistend. This inequality may lead to abnormal interactions between the 2 alveoli, which will apply mechanical stress and may lead to mechanotransduction and VILI, or overt rupture of the lung units. If all lung units are open, the number of junctional interfaces {e.g. between healthy tissue and collapsed alveoli) is reduced; thus, the whole lung moves as one during inspiration and expiration and the transpulmonary pressure is applied across the whole lung equally, and the stress is minimal. In heterogeneous lung tissue, minimising the number of junctional interfaces, by recruiting closed lung tissue, may be beneficial in reducing stress. In mechanical engineering, strain is the ratio of the increase in length of a structure, divided by its resting / unstressed length. This is not ideal in pulmonary physiology, as the lung does not have an unstressed volume since it is always impacted upon by the pleural pressure keeping it open.
