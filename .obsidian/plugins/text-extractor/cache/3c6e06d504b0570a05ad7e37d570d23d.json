ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY 1.We recommend that administration of IV antimicrobials should be initiated as soon as possible after recognition and within one hour for both sepsis and septic shock (strong recommendation, moderate quality pf evidence). 2. We recommend empiric broad-spectrum therapy with one or more antimicrobials for patients presenting with sepsis or septic shock to cover alllikely pathogens (including bacterial and potentially fungal or viral coverage) (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 3.We recommend that empiric antimicrobial therapy be narrowed once pathogen identification and sensitiviies are established and/or adequate clinical improvement is noted (BPS). 4.We recommend against sustained systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients with severe inflammatory states of noninfectious origin (e.g, severe pancreatitis, burn injury) (BPS). 5.We recommend that dosing strategies of antimicrobials be optimized based on accepted pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles and specific drug properties in patients with sepsis or septic shock (BPS). 6. We suggest empiric combination therapy (using at least two antibiotics of different antimicrobial classes) aimed at the most likely bacterial pathogen(s) for the initial management of septic shock (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). Remarks: Readers should review Table 6 for definitions of empiric, targeted/definitive, broad-spectrum, combination, and multidrug therapy before reading this section. 7. We suggest that combination therapy not be routinely used for ongoing treatment of most other serious infections, including bacteremia and sepsis without shock (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). Remarks: This does not preclude the use of multidrug therapy to broaden antimicrobial activity. 8. We recommend against combination therapy for the routine treatment of neutropenic sepsis/bacteremia (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Remarks: This does not preclude the use of multidrug therapy to broaden antimicrobial activity.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
