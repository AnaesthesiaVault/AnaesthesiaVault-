Neuropathic pain: Pain caused by a lesion or disease of the so- matosensory nervous system.’ Specific features of neuropathic pain include pain descriptions of tingling’, ‘shooting’ or ‘electric shock’. The presence of positive findings such as allodynia (a stimulus that would not normally provoke pain) or hyperalgesia (increased sensi- tivity to pain) or negative findings such as weakness or numbness also support a diagnosis. Sensitization: Increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons to their normal input, and/or recruitment of a response to normally subthreshold inputs. Central sensitization: Increased responsiveness of nociceptive neu- rons in the central nervous system to their normal or subthreshold afferent input.” Peripheral sensitization: Increased responsiveness and reduced threshold of nociceptive neurons in the periphery to the stimulation of their receptive fields.’","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
