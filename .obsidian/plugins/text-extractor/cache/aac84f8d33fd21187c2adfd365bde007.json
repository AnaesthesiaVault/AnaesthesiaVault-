There are 6,4, and 12 subsegments in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes. There are 10 subsegments in both the left upper and lower lobes, for a total of 42 subsegments. Following removal of a functioning right lower lobe, a patient would be expected to lose 12/42 (29%) of their respiratory reserve. If the patient has a preoperative FEV1 (or DLCO) 70% of predicted, the patient would be expected to have a ppoFEV1=70% x (1-29/100)=50%.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
