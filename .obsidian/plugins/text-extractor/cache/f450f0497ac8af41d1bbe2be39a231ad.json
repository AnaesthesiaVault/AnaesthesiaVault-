Clonidine prolongs duration of analgesia and anaesthesia (by approximately 2 hours) when added to local anaesthetics for axillary and peribulbar blocks, but evidence is inconclusive when clonidine is added to supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks or continuous catheter techniques. Beware of the dose-independent, systemic side effect of hypotension, bradycardia and sedation. 3. Adding clonidine to lignocaine intravenous regional anaesthesia delays tourniquet pain. 4. Long-term effects of perineural magnesium are unclear. 5. Magnesium sulphate improves intra- and postoperative analgesia and tourniquet tolerance when added to lignocaine intravenous regional anaesthesia. 6. Ketamine reduces pain when applied topically in oral mucositis. Adding ketamine to local anaesthetic agents is not recommended. 7. Alkalinisation by adding sodium bicarbonate is no longer recommended. 8. Adding dexamethasone to local anaesthetic agents for peripheral nerve blocks increases the duration of blockade to varying degrees depending on the site of administration, with the most benefit seen with upper limb blocks (50-240%). This effect appears to be equivalent if the dexamethasone is alternatively administered intravenously in doses of at least 10 mg. 9. Practitioners are advised that some adjuvant agents have preservatives with potentially undesirable effects and that an increased risk of drug errors exists when combining these adjuvant agents with local anaesthetics.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
