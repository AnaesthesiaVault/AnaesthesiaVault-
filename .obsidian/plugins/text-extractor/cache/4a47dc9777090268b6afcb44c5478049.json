(o) Sepsisinduced myocardial dysfunction is inifially manifested as decreased contractility, as indicated by the low slope of the ESPVR, which initially results in a low stroke volume. (b) However, several compensatory mechanisms help to restore stroke volume and result in hyperdynamic septic shock with an elevated stroke volume. Decreased afterload allows further ejection to a smaller end- systolic volume. Increased end-diastolic volume (EDV) occurs due to volume resuscitation and can also occur as a result of increased diastolic compliance (a shift of the end-diastolic pressure volume relationship down and to the right). Finally, infused catecholamines may increase contractility, which is a shift up and fo the left of the ESPVR.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
