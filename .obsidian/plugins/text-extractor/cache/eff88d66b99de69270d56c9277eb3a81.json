As lung with better elastic recoil and less expiratory flow limitation is recruited, the FEV, improves and the ventilation perfusion mismatch reduces.’ (ii) Reduction in lung volume Eorrects the effects that by~ ‘perinflation has upon the chest wall and diaphragm. This improves the efficiency of the respiratory muscles and re- duces the work of breathing.®? (iii) Dynamic hyperinflation of the lunghas an effecton the heart similar to cardiac tamponade.
