Hyperoxia has been associated with an increase in mortality and a reduction in ventilator free-days. Hyperoxia-induced lung injury is characterised by a change in the protein composition of surfactant, histological changes, and a reduction in mucociliary clearance. These changes manifest as reduced lung compliance, atelectasis and an increased risk of pulmenary infections. Â¢) Retina Retinopathy of prematurity is well described in premature neonates exposed to a high F\\O,. d) Coronary arteries A high F0, in non-hypoxaemic patients is associated with coronary arterial vasoconstriction. Patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction had an increased likelihood of recurrent myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and larger infarct size at 6 months if they were given supplemental oxygen, compared to air. e) Neonatal resuscitation There is a lower mortality rate in neonates resuscitated with an F/O, of 1.0 compared to those resuscitated with an F0,0f 0.21. f) Severe traumatic brain injury (T81) Extreme hyperoxaemia (p,0, >64kPa / 480mmHg) as well as hypoxaemia are associated with an increased mortality....however, the effects of less extreme hyperoxaemia are inconclusive with some studies showing harm, whereas others show improved outcome or no effect! The optimal p,0,in TBI remains uncertain. g) Post-cardiac arrest Following resuscitation after cardiac arrest, early hyperoxaemia is independently associated with poor neurological function at hospital discharge (relative risk 1.23; 95%Cl 1.11-1.35). The greatest association between supranormal levels of p,0, and poor neurological outcome was seen with p,0, >300mmHg / 40kPa. In addition, there is an association between the duration of hyperoxia exposure and neurological outcome. A 1-hour duration of hyperoxia exposure is associated with a 3% increase in poor neurological outcome (RR 1.03; 95%Cl 1.02-1.05) (Roberts ~ Circulation 2018). h) Post-ischaemic stroke Hyperoxia has been linked with worse outcomes in patients with ischaemic stroke,","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
