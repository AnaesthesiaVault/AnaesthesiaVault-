Increased volume of distribution (Vd) Septic patients have circulating endotoxins and exotoxins which damage capillaries and cause capillary leak. This causes fluid to shift from the intravascular space to the interstitial space, taking with it hydrophilic molecules (importantly, antibiotics!!) which hugely increases their Vd and therefore reduces the serum concentration of the hydrophilic antimicrobials. In addition, vasodilatation and hypotension frequently require fluid resuscitation which, over hours, further expands the interstitium and further increases the Vd. It is important to recognise that the increase in Vd is only of relevance for hydrophilic antibiotics (the majority of antibiotics used in clinical practice), and not those which are lipophilic.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
