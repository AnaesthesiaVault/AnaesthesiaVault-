All these factors promote cancer progression, metastatic recurrence, increase motility/invasiveness of cancer cells, and increase neovascularization Relief of cancer and perioperative pain inhibits tumor growth and metastasis Inflammation Inflammation produces angiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors, cytokines, and proteases that potentiate neoplastic progression NSAIDs reduce immunosuppression and reduce tumour progression. Opioids Perioperative morphine induces immunosuppression. Hydromorphone, oxycodone, and buprenorphine have lower immunosuppressive activity, and tramadol does not suppress immune functions Opioids have proangiogenic effect Methylnaltrexone inhibits angiogenesis and immune response, attenuates tumor growth, and reduces lung metastasis in mice inoculated with cancer cells The higher MOR expression and opioid dose requirement is associated with shorter survival Anesthesia Some general anesthetics (ketamine, thiopental, and halothane) suppress NK cell activity and increase metastases Inhaled anesthetics up-regulate HIF, which can facilitate cancer spread and contribute to cancer recurrence Propofol is better than inhaled anesthesia in terms of immunity and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells General anesthesia combined with regional anesthesia/analgesia improves immune outcome and reduces metastatic burden in animals, risk of metastasis in breast cancer, VEGF and TGF- expression Some studies have shown controversial results in terms of survival with epidural anesthesia/analgesia Prospective ongoing clinical trials are investigating influence of regional anesthesia in some tumor outcomes","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
