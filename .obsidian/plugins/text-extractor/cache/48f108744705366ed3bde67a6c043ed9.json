These can occasionally cause mild side-effects, including nausea, vomiting, and pain on injection, and there is a recognized, albeit low, incidence of anaphylactoid reac- tions. However, gadolinium-based contrast agents have been implicated in causing nephro- genic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with impaired renal function and it is usual to assess renal function by measuring an estimated glomerular filtration rate in all patients receiving gadolinium.'?> Although all commercially available linear chelates of gadolinium have been reported to cause NSF, the majority of cases are related to gadodiamide.' There is also an increased incidence of NSF in patients with concurrent liver disease.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
