Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and we recommend that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately (BPS). 2.We recommend that, in the resuscitation from sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, at least 30mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid be given within the first 3 hours (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). 3.We recommend that, following initial fluid resuscitation, additional fluids be guided by frequent reassessment of hemodynamic status (BPS). Remarks: Reassessment should include a thorough clinical examination and evaluation of available physiologic variables (heart rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, temperature, urine output, and others, as available) as well as other noninvasive or invasive monitoring, as available. 4. We recommend further hemodynamic assessment (such as assessing cardiac function) to determine the type of shock if the clinical examination does not lead to a clear diagnosis (BPS). 5. We suggest that dynamic over static variables be used to predict fluid responsiveness, where available (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). 6.We recommend an initial target mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg in patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 7. We suggest guiding resuscitation to normalize lactate in patients with elevated lactate levels as a marker of tissue hypoperfusion (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). B. SCREENING FOR SEPSIS AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT 1.We recommend that hospitals and hospital systems have a performance improvement program for sepsis, including sepsis screening for acutely il high risk patients (BPS). C. DIAGNOSIS 1.We recommend that appropriate routine microbiologic cultures (including blood) be obtained before starting antimicrobial therapy in patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock if doing so results in no substantial delay in the start of antimicrobials (BPS). Remarks: Appropriate routine microbiologic cultures always include at least two sets of blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
