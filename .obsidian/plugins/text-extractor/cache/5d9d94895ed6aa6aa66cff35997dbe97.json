The value of ultrasound as a diagnostic cardiac modality is in many re- spects unparalleled. It is more portable and less expensive compared with other imaging modalities (computed tomography, magnetic res- onance imaging, nuclear perfusion imaging). Unlike methods that ex- pose patients to radiation, there are no known adverse effects of ultrasound used at diagnostic imaging intensities, which allows safe, se- rial evaluation of patients. Echocardiography permits rapid assessment of cardiac size, structure, function, and hemodynamics. Ultrasound im- ages are evaluated in real time, which allows rapid diagnostic interpre- tation in a wide variety of settings, such as the outpatient clinic, inpatient ward, critical care unit, emergency department, operating room, remote clinic, and cardiac catheterization laboratory. Cardiac ul- trasound is used across the entire spectrum of patient care from in utero to the frail elderly patient. Echocardiography is sensitive and spe- ciﬁc for a broad range of clinical disorders, which allows evaluation of a wide variety of parameters with well-documented prognostic utility. In an effort to increase the value of echocardiography even further, platforms have been developed that incorporated advanced imaging capabilities (three-dimensional [3D], strain imaging) and complex al- gorithms for quantitative analysis. Equally important to the technical performance of this modality is the training of the clinicians who use it. Even before images are From the University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois (K.T.S.); Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego, California (B.J.K.); University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin (C.E.K., P.S.R.); Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (P.A.P.); and Cedar-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California (R.J.S.).

Given the exten- sive expertise required for accu- rate use, guidelines have been established for the knowledge base, practical experience, and continued maintenance of com- petency for echocardiographic image acquisition.2-4 Image anal ysis, interpretation, and report ing require extensive training. Recommendations for these also exist.2,4,5 In addition, there are comprehensive guidelines that incorporate extensive recom mendations for echocardiogra phic use in clinical practice.6-12 The expertise required to use advanced platforms and the extensive training required to appropriately analyze and inter pret transthoracic images have traditionally only been fulﬁlled by specialists in cardiovascular medicine. Two major developments have changed the practice of car- diac ultrasound: \u0001 Development of small ultrasound platforms. These devices have signiﬁcantly fewer features and capabilities, which make them easier to operate. Despite their small size, they have proven diagnostic utility when used by physicians with comprehensive echocardiographic training. 13-20 Simpliﬁed operation and substantially smaller size and cost have opened their potential use to nontraditional cardiac ultrasound users. However, the easier operation of small devices does not obviate the need for training to acquire and interpret cardiac images. \u0001 Physicians from diverse specialties have become interested in having access to the diagnostic value of cardiac ultrasound in clinical settings relevant to their scope of practice. This has led to the concept of focused use of cardiac ultrasound. The hypothesis is that nontraditional users, who have less train- ing in cardiac image acquisition and interpretation compared with those trained in echocardiography, can learn to acquire and interpret cardiac ultra- sound images as an adjunct to their physical examination assessment. It is important to maintain excellence in the practice of echocardi- ography, a discipline that requires signiﬁcant training and knowledge of guidelines for acquisition, analysis, and interpretation, while en- abling ultrasound to be used as a tool by nonechocardiographers to augment their clinical assessments traditionally based on physical ex- amination alone. It is recognized that there is a broad continuum of imaging and interpretive expertise among physicians with cardiac ul- trasound training. Some users may understand more advanced imag- ing acquisition, analysis, and interpretation. However, as in most areas of medicine, speciﬁc thresholds of expertise need to be deﬁned. This is critical to providing excellent patient care by holding physicians accountable to practice within their scope of expertise as well as setting expectations for the practitioner, referring physician, and patient. The current document distinguishes the emerging ﬁeld of focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) as a bedside adjunct to the physical examination and echocardiography. Deﬁning the distinctions be- tween these techniques will allow practitioners to realize the utility of FCU and yet maintain the value of echocardiography. This guide- line will not address ultrasound imaging outside of the cardiovascular system or nontransthoracic ultrasound modalities (ie, transesophageal echocardiography). This guideline is speciﬁc to cardiac imaging in the adult. 2. DEFINITIONS a. What is FCU? FCU is a focused examination of the cardiovascular system performed by a physician by using ultrasound as an ad- junct to the physical examination to recognize speciﬁc ul- trasonic signs that represent a narrow list of potential diagnoses in speciﬁc clinical settings. b. Terminology There are a variety of terms that have been used to describe a focused ultrasound of the heart. The importance of deﬁning the nomenclature is the recognition that these procedures are distinct from the practice of echocardiography, as outlined in section 3. The American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) recommends the use of the term ‘‘focused cardiac ultrasound,’’ but recognizes that other terms are in use (Table 1). The literature also contains hybrid terms that should be avoided because the expectations of the examination, equipment used, expertise in image acquisition, and proﬁciency in data analysis and interpretation are unclear if these terms are used. Such terms in- clude ‘‘focused echocardiography,’’ ‘‘hand-held echocardiography,’’ ‘‘hand-carried echocardiography,’’ ‘‘point of care echocardiography,’’ and ‘‘directed echocardiography.’’ The appropriate terminology for echocardiography has previously been established and includes ‘‘complete’’ or ‘‘comprehensive’’ echocardiography and ‘‘limited’’ echocardiography. 3. DIFFERENTIATION OF FCU AND ‘‘LIMITED TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY (TTE)’’ The technical requirements for equipment, expertise for image acqui- sition, and the knowledge base for image analysis and interpretation have been well deﬁned for echocardiography. This permits the appro- priate and safe use of echocardiography in an unlimited number of clinical scenarios and permits its users to have a very broad scope of practice. Because of equipment capability, image acquisition train- ing, image interpretation training, and image interpretation knowl- edge base, the practitioner of FCU will have a scope of practice that is restricted to the equipment and skill set that he or she possesses. The scope of practice may be a speciﬁc patient population or a clinical setting. The speciﬁc clinical question to be addressed and the cardiac abnormalities that can be ruled in or out with the focused examina- tion will be narrow. The difference between the limited Abbreviations ADHF = Acutely decompensated heart failure ASE = American Society of Echocardiography CPT = Center for Medicare Service’s Current Procedural Terminology DICOM = Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine eFCU = Expert FCU EKG = Electrocardiographic FCU = Focused cardiac ultrasound ICU = Intensive care unit IVC = Inferior vena cava LA = Left atrium LV = Left ventricle LVH = Left ventricle hypertrophy LVSD = LV systolic dysfunction RA = Right atrium RV = Right ventricle TTE = Transthoracic echocardiography 2D = Two-dimensional 3D = Three-dimensional 568 Spencer et al Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography June 2013 echocardiogram and FCU rests in the expectations of the examina- tion, the equipment used, the expertise in image acquisition, and pro- ﬁciency in data analysis and interpretation. ‘‘Limited’’ refers to a reduced number of images, whereas ‘‘focused’’ refers to a narrowed, speciﬁc question and scope of expertise (Tables 2 and 3). a. Examination Expectations With FCU, subjective interpretation of one or a few prechosen targets of interest is emphasized, with the intent that subsequent referral for an echocardiographic study will delineate and measure all ﬁndings, in- cluding incidental or associated ﬁndings, which may go unrecognized by FCU. Abnormalities when using FCU are typically classiﬁed as present or absent by using a predeﬁned speciﬁc imaging protocol. The practitioner is ‘‘focused’’ on making a speciﬁc diagnosis or identi- fying a potentially signiﬁcant valvular, hemodynamic, or structural ab- normality. This approach allows rapid detection of a small number of evidence-based targets at the bedside that could provide clues to the patient’s cardiac status and requires less training and expertise than that considered adequate to perform echocardiography. The results of an FCU examination can be used in conjunction with other bed- side measures, such as the physical examination, in formulating an ini- tial diagnostic impression and guiding appropriate early triage and management. Although a FCU evaluation may facilitate initial management, all patients with abnormal ﬁndings not previously documented on echo- cardiography should be referred for a comprehensive echocardio- graphic examination. A physician with only FCU expertise does not have the image acquisition or interpretation expertise to completely evaluate a symptomatic cardiac patient. Comprehensive echocardi- ography allows additional characterization of an abnormality from supplementary views, complete assessment of the hemodynamics as- sociated with a lesion and further evaluation of a ﬁnding with addi- tional ultrasound tools (Doppler, 3D, etc). When FCU evaluation fails to detect any prespeciﬁed abnormalities in a patient with symp- toms or signs of cardiovascular disease, referral for comprehensive echocardiography is probably warranted. For example, in a patient with dyspnea, although FCU may allow rapid and accurate exclusion of a large pericardial effusion or signiﬁcant left ventricle (LV) systolic dysfunction, numerous other cardiac pathologies missed by FCU, but detectable by comprehensive echocardiography, remain to be in- vestigated as alternative causes of the patient’s breathlessness. The implications of the FCU examination go beyond its terminol- ogy in regard to the perception of the act by the patients, their families, health care professionals, and the legal profession. Patients who un- dergo or witness an FCU examination should be informed that this particular use of ultrasound is a new method that is meant to enhance bedside examination by providing ‘‘early’’ or ‘‘preliminary’’ informa- tion that is used to formulate the physician’s initial impression. Importantly, it is not equivalent to a diagnostic echocardiographic study. The operator is incorporating his or her recognition and knowl- edge of speciﬁc ﬁndings within the scope of his or her clinical practice in the care of the patient. Patients and their families should be told that signiﬁcant abnormal ﬁndings will be conﬁrmed with a complete diagnostic echocardiogram. Patients should understand that an echo- cardiogram will be performed as soon as practical if their symptoms or signs warrant one. Likewise, when patients undergo echocardiogra- phy after an FCU examination, they should understand that this is not a duplicate or repeated examination but a comprehensive evalu- ation of their condition by an expert in cardiac imaging. With echocardiography, the whole sum of knowledge is applied ‘‘upfront,’’ with measurements of normal structures and function, documentation of ﬁndings other than those that may have prompted the referral, and a thorough search to answer the referral question. The ASE has provided detailed recommendations for the perfor- mance, interpretation, documentation, and image storage that apply to comprehensive and limited echocardiographic examinations.2 These standards were developed to contribute to patient and pro- vider satisfaction, and to improve patient outcomes. The ‘‘limited’’ descriptor of a limited echocardiogram simply refers to the fact that, compared with a comprehensive examination, the number of views obtained and the number of images that are ac- quired are fewer. Every other aspect of limited echocardiography is the same as for comprehensive echocardiography. The practitioner will completely interpret all available data from all images, albeit in a limited echocardiogram from a more ‘‘limited’’ number of images. The clinical decision to perform a limited echocardiogram, as op- posed to a comprehensive examination, requires expertise in echo- cardiography and speciﬁc knowledge of the appropriate indications. When performing a limited echocardiogram, the imager must have the knowledge of all views necessary to characterize or exclude the referral diagnosis. In addition, a clinician performing a limited echo- cardiogram must be cognizant of the potential to miss ﬁndings not in the ﬁeld of view that (1) could offer an alternative explanation for the patient’s referral or (2) are incidental but clinically signiﬁcant.

When performing limited echocardiography, report genera- tion and comparison with prior studies must follow standard require- ments of echocardiography. b.Equipment Ultrasound machines have evolved from large, poorly moveable de- vices to hand-carried ultrasound instruments and now pocket-sized devices. It is not the size or weight characteristics that deﬁne an echo- cardiographic machine. The use of FCU in this document generally applies to a nonechocardiographer imager who is using a basic ultra- sound device. However, nonechocardiographer users who acquire images with a high-end platform or users trained in echocardiography who use pocket ultrasound devices are also performing FCU (Table 4). The equipment used for limited echocardiography should be capa- ble of performing two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography, M-mode, color-ﬂow imaging, and spectral and tissue Doppler ultrasound. Although all of these modalities may not be used in every case, their availability is critical in preserving the expectation that a patient referred for echocardiography (whether limited or complete) will receive the examination needed to delineate all abnormalities. Platforms for FCU are intended to answer a speciﬁc clinical question within the technologic limitations of a small device and thus do not require all these modalities. Echocardiographic examinations (comprehensive and limited) require that a broad selection of transducers be available for use, whereas FCU does not. In the process of miniaturization, many of the fundamental capabilities of an echocardiogram have been omit- ted, including advanced signal processing and electrocardiographic (EKG) gating. The small screen size and reduced image resolution on devices used in FCU may limit recognition of diagnostic ﬁndings. The platform of a typical FCU device is incompatible with the perfor- mance of detailed or gated measurements that are the minimum professional standard for echocardiography. Echocardiographic platforms must store images in a method compatible with DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standards. Platforms that do not export in the DICOM format should not be used to perform echocardiography (limited or comprehensive). c.Image Acquisition Differentiating the image acquisition aspects of FCU and ‘‘Limited TTE’’ is best made by noting the requirements for image acquisition for limited echocardiography. Guidelines for speciﬁc training and credentialing of sonographers and physicians to acquire images in echocardiography have been published.2,4,21 Speciﬁc imaging components for completion of a comprehensive examination are speciﬁed. Practitioners who perform limited echocardiography need familiarity with all the windows and views of a comprehensive examination, because different clinical situations may require a particular subset of a comprehensive examination. Limited echocardiographic examinations may require any or all of the modalities used in a comprehensive examination. Practitioners who perform limited echocardiography need to be proﬁcient in 2D, pulsed-wave and continuous-wave Doppler, color-Doppler, tissue Doppler, and M-mode echocardiography. The limited echocardio- graphic acquisition skill set must include familiarity with all trans- ducers used in comprehensive echocardiography, because the clinical question, which may be answered with a limited echocardio- gram examination, may require any of a number of transducers. Image quality of a limited echocardiographic examination is expected to be equal to comprehensive echocardiography to provide compara- ble data for side-by-side comparisons during assessment of temporal changes in patient status. d.Image Interpretation In the practice of limited echocardiography, the user is responsible for interpretation and delineation of primary, associated, and ‘‘incidental’’ ﬁndings that are apparent or became apparent while obtaining the Table 3 Differences between limited echocardiography and FCU Limited echocardiogram FCU Patients Any adult patient Deﬁned scope of practice Location of imaging Any location Deﬁned scope of practice Image protocol Skill to perform any view, but only selected views may be required Limited number of views Equipment Full function (M-mode, 2D, color Doppler, spectral Doppler, TDI, contrast), EKG gated 2D minimum Transducers Multiple Single Measurements Advanced quantiﬁcation None or linear measurement Acquisition Sonographer or level II/III echocardiographer Physician with FCU training Interpretation Echocardiographer; all pathology and normal structures within imaging view Physician with FCU training deﬁned, limited scope Image storage DICOM format, archived for easy retrieval and review Only for select indications (see text) Documentation Formal report meeting ICAEL standards Documentation as brief report or as part of PE depending on indication Billing 93308 None TDI, Tissue Doppler imaging; ICAEL, Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Echocardiography Laboratories; PE, physical examination. Table 4 Types of cardiac ultrasound examinations by level of training and nature of equipment Equipment capabilities Training level Nonechocardiographer Echocardiographer Basic FCU eFCU Comprehensive FCU Echocardiography 570 Spencer et al Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography June 2013 views. Similar to the radiographic standard of chest X-ray interpreta- tion in which the radiologist is accountable for the diagnosis of a soli- tary pulmonary nodule even when the primary cardiac ﬁnding of the radiograph is cardiomegaly, a limited echocardiogram that ‘‘excludes’’ a pericardial effusion is still accountable for a diagnosis of any evident wall-motion abnormality, valvular disease, or signiﬁcant ﬁnding clearly present in the speciﬁc views recorded. Moreover, the interpre- tation must include assessment of key structures and cardiac function, including performance of measurements when feasible. Finally, there must be a report that includes key elements of cardiac structure and function, ﬁndings, and interpretation. In these circumstances, an echocardiogram, comprehensive or lim- ited, provides the maximum ultrasonic diagnostic capabilities and ex- pert interpretation and upholds the perceived standards and justiﬁed costs of the echocardiogram held by the referring physician, patient, and payers. FCU does not require quantitation or provide equivalent diagnostic capability, and it is not the expectation of the user to delin- eate and quantify all ﬁndings viewed. e.Billing In the United States, the Center for Medicare Service’s Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes provides a system in which a participating health care provider can bill for the particular services rendered. The calculated reimbursement for a procedure is deter- mined on a ‘‘relative value’’ scale that takes into account practice ex- pense, physician work, malpractice costs, and the relative value of the procedure adjusted to regional factors where the service was ren- dered, the so-called resource-based relative value scale. In calculating the physician work component for limited echocardiography, the fol- lowing factors are considered: physician time, technical skill, physical effort, mental effort, judgment, and stress due to potential risk to the patient. The submission of limited echocardiographic CPT (93308) for FCU would be inappropriate because the components used in the resource-based relative value scale cost estimates for FCU and lim- ited echocardiography are different. Practice expenses are different primarily due to the substantial dif- ferences in machine, room, documentation, image storage, and per- sonnel costs. Liability is different because the echocardiographer is responsible for interpretation and delineation of primary, associated, and ‘‘incidental’’ ﬁndings that are apparent or became apparent while obtaining the images. FCU users are responsible for recognizing a fo- cused list of potential diagnoses in speciﬁc clinical settings within their scope of practice. Finally, the physician work component, which in- cludes time, technical skill, and mental effort, is entirely different be- tween FCU and limited echocardiography. FCU is not a procedure described under current echocardiographic CPT codes. Use of the limited echocardiography code for FCU is not appropriate because the resource-based determination for reimbursement was made by assuming the standards established for echocardiography. 4. CONSIDERATIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL USE OF FCU AS AN ADJUNCT TO PHYSICAL EXAMINATION a. Personnel Rapid evaluation to expedite patient triage and early management is an important role of specialists in emergency medicine. Assessment of critically ill patients after hours or at the bedside after a sudden change in clinical status is a role of critical care physicians. Internists, surgeons, and hospitalists perform serial evaluations of hospitalized adult pa- tients daily. These are all situations when a sonographer or level II/ III trained physician in echocardiography are potentially not immedi- ately available or cannot be present for daily image acquisition. All these physicians could potentially use FCU to augment their cardiac physical examination assessment. As long as the training require- ments are met and maintenance of competency and quality assur- ance are documented, many adult medical and surgical specialties could potentially use FCU. It is essential that physicians who use FCU have realistic expectations of their abilities to image and interpret as well as knowledge of the limitations of FCU devices. Inappropriate interpretation or application of FCU beyond a deﬁned scope of prac- tice may have adverse consequences for patient care. Sonographers and physicians with level II or III training in echocar- diography can acquire images without additional training, and physi- cians with level II or III training in echocardiography can interpret FCU images. Although these practitioners have the required expertise for image acquisition and interpretation, if using a device typically used for FCU, then they would not be performing echocardiography. For the purposes of distinction, this document refers to this as expert FCU (eFCU). Use of FCU by medical students should be for educa- tional or training purposes only, under the direct supervision of an echocardiographer or a trained FCU physician.22 Likewise, use by nurses or other allied health care professionals who are not registered cardiac sonographers should be for research purposes only and not for clinical use.23,24 b. Equipment Ultrasound platforms for cardiac imaging can be broadly character- ized into 4 groups: (1) Full functionality platforms. These devices have the complete range of echocardiographic image acquisition capabilities (M-mode, 2D, color- Doppler, spectral Doppler, tissue Doppler), have advanced quantiﬁcation and analysis packages, permit acquisition, and processing of stress images, have advanced image processing for contrast enhancement, and have a wide array of specialized transducers for advanced functions such as transesophageal and 3D echocardiography. (2) Small ultrasound platforms. These machines typically support the standard echocardiographic modalities (M-mode, 2D, color Doppler, spectral Doppler, transesophageal echocardiography, and stress) but are smaller and may lack advanced imaging options. (3) Hand-carried platforms. These machines, which generally weigh 6-12 pounds, are readily carried by a user to the bedside or may be cart based. These typically have standard cardiac ultrasound capabilities and may have fundamental quantiﬁcation packages. (4) Pocket platforms. These devices are compact and can be placed in a lab coat pocket. Pocket ultrasound instruments include basic ultrasound func- tionality such as 2D imaging and may or may not have color Doppler. Although an FCU examination can be performed with a full func- tionality ultrasound platform, the size, expense, and complexity of these instruments are disparate with the clinical settings in which FCU is useful as well as the abilities of an FCU provider. Small ultra- sound platforms can also be used by a nonechocardiographer to per- form an FCU assessment. However, the cost of these devices makes their use solely as an adjunct to the physical examination impractical. In some hospital intensive care units (ICU) or emergency department settings, these machines are used for other diagnostic (noncardiac) procedures and, therefore, available for FCU use. Use of these small platforms capable of performing echocardiography by a practitioner without echocardiographic training and imaging and/or interpreta- tion expertise should be considered FCU, not limited echocardiogra- phy. In practice, these devices are typically used by practitioners with Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography Volume 26 Number 6 Spencer et al 571 comprehensive echocardiographic acquisition and interpretation skills in settings in which their smaller size is an advantage. The devices ideally suited for FCU extension of physical examina- tion use a simpler technology compared with full-functionality echo- cardiographic platforms. Most reports that evaluated FCU by nonechocardiographer users have been with hand-carried platforms. Although pocket-sized instruments have shown clinical promise, the published literature consists primarily of their use by experienced imagers or cardiology fellows. 13-20,25-32 It is possible that the reduced imaging abilities and smaller screen will make it more difﬁcult for nonechocardiographer practitioners to use pocket devices accurately. FCU equipment must consist of a transducer with a frequency ap- propriate for adult patients. Minimum display requirements include the ability to label the images with at least 2 patient identiﬁers, date and time of examination. Electronic calipers are not required, but there should be markers that indicate scale or image depth. Measurement packages are not standard, because much of the clinical functionality of FCU is for rapid qualitative assessment. Minimum functionality con- sists of 2D grayscale imaging and controls for depth and gain adjust- ment. Studies or images used to evaluate a symptomatic patient to direct management because formal echocardiography is not available should be stored in a retrievable location. Ideally, stored images should be in the DICOM format and be exportable to the digital archive where the patient’s echocardiographic images are stored. Additional functionality is available on hand-carried and pocket devices. These capabilities (color-Doppler, spectral Doppler and tissue Doppler) require more training to appropriately use and inter- pret, which would extend the duration of FCU instruction. In addi- tion, these capabilities are typically not needed for the scope of FCU practices. Demonstrating that the extra training and device costs for color-Doppler FCU adds clinical value would require that (1) FCU augmented physical examination could detect clinically important valvular lesions not already apparent by physical examination, and (2) the early bedside identiﬁcation of the valvular lesion makes a clinically important difference over having it detected at the time of a standard TTE. Supplementary functionality only seeks to increase the costs of the devices, potentially reducing their cost-effectiveness. There also is concern that users may attempt to implement features or functionality without the proper training, which potentially results in erroneous clinical conclusions and adverse patient outcomes. Although an echocardiographer or qual- iﬁed sonographer would have the training to acquire images by using these additional functionalities of a hand-carried or pocket ultrasound, the clinical scenarios when this would be preferred over a standard platform with better quality imaging and more capabilities are infrequent and discussed in a later section of the article (eFCU). c. Potential Limitations of FCU Using FCU as an adjunct to physical examination is facilitated by using smaller ultrasound devices (hand carried or pocket). However, these devices may not have the capabilities to image all ﬁndings. A system that weighs less than 10 pounds with an estimated cost between $8,000-$30,000 should not be expected to produce the image qual- ity of a 200 pounds, $200,000 system. The transducer technology is not the same, and the complex image enhancement and artifact re- duction abilities cannot be reproduced on an FCU machine. In addi- tion, the images are visualized on a screen with signiﬁcantly lower resolution and size compared with those available with state-of-the- art echocardiography. Commonly performed acquisition modiﬁca- tions, such as the ability to zoom, alter the ultrasound beam focus, narrow sector width, adjust dynamic range, use harmonic imaging, use settings optimized for contrast, change grayscale maps, or opti- mize transducer frequency, may be lacking. These restrictions make identiﬁcation of subtle abnormalities inappropriate for FCU scope of practice. Despite these limitations, small devices with speciﬁcations that are inadequate for performing echocardiography can generate clinically useful images. Instruments used for FCU have been miniaturized to improve functionality at the bedside. The compromise of smaller devices is loss of features, including spectral Doppler, tissue Doppler, and 3D. This concession is certainly worthwhile because it allows the devices to be smaller and less expensive. Lack of spectral Doppler makes FCU inappropriate for the assessment of pericardial constriction, pulmo- nary hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction. Quantitation of regurgi- tant or stenotic valvular lesion severity is also not appropriate with FCU. However, the morphology of stenotic valves and secondary ﬁndings, such as chamber enlargement and hypertrophy, to suggest pressure or volume overload or left ventricle (LV)-right ventricle (RV) interaction may still be detected by the astute user. Color Doppler is available on most systems and has been used to qualita- tively assess for potentially severe regurgitant lesions of the aortic and mitral valve. To distinguish the limitations of the smaller devices from the skill of the user, the writing group reviewed studies that included at least 50 patients in which a small platform was compared with traditional echocardiography, with all images acquired and interpreted by ex- perts to determine which pathologies FCU devices are capable of de- tecting despite their reduced functionality. Articles that use cardiology fellows as imagers were not included. Cardiac abnormalities that have been accurately detected included the following: \u0001 LV enlargement 18,19,29,33-35 \u0001 LV hypertrophy 19,29,30,35-39 \u0001 LV systolic function 16,18-20,28,30-32,34-37,39-45 \u0001 LA enlargement 28-30,34-36,42,43,45 \u0001 RV enlargement30,35,42 \u0001 RV systolic function 28,31,32,34,39,42 \u0001 Pericardial effusion 20,28,30-32,35,37,39-42 \u0001 Inferior vena cava (IVC) size30,44 There are a variety of both standard and nonstandard echocardio- graphic windows used to assess cardiac structures. From each win- dow, multiple views and sweeps of the heart are typically acquired. There is no question that certain windows and/or views are easier to learn than others. The parasternal and subcostal views, for example, are typically easier to master. The landmarks for these windows are characteristically more reliable. Imaging from the parasternal window is easier to hold stable and consistently provides more interpretable images than the apical views. Parasternal views are less dependent on patient positioning and less subject to interference from patient body habitus. The parasternal window is preferred for the assessment of LV systolic function by less experienced users.46 Proﬁciency in ac- quiring adequate parasternal views by novices under direct proctoring is similar to acquiring an apical 4-chamber view but much easier than the apical 2-chamber view.47 Other views, such as the apical planes, are more difﬁcult to opti- mize and require expertise to correctly adjust patient position and breathing cycle to acquire. In addition, apical views require a more powerful transducer with higher penetration, which may not be available with hand-carried or pocket-sized platforms. 572 Spencer et al Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography June 2013 Optimization of cardiac views is critical to obtaining a correct diag- nosis. Nonexpert imagers obtain adequate images from the paraster- nal view nearly twice as often as from the apical views with an FCU device.26 It is also clear that off-axis imaging and foreshortening from the apical views can lead to incorrect conclusions and errone- ous clinical management. Nonexpert imagers must be aware of the pitfalls and limitations of apical imaging before imaging is attempted. Because of these factors, the parasternal and subcostal views are pre- ferred for FCU imaging. Diagnoses that depend on nontraditional windows (right parasternal, suprasternal) should not be made or ex- cluded with FCU. Complex or unusual cardiac disorders should not be expected to be diagnosed by a physician solely trained in FCU. In addition, some pathologies are subtle and are difﬁcult to recognize (LV wall mo- tion). Other abnormalities require assimilation of data from multiple views to correctly deﬁne (RV systolic function and size). Certain ﬁnd- ings on a cardiac ultrasound image may only make sense considered in the context of a broader picture, which requires extensive training in cardiovascular disease, such as in patients with congenital heart dis- ease or other uncommon disorders. Because these are beyond the ex- perience of FCU training and experience, the following pathologies are unlikely to be accurately detected by FCU examination: aortic dis- section, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, LV regional wall-motion ab- normalities, LV aneurysm, cardiac masses, RV hypertrophy, LV thrombus, and valvular vegetations. Although small ultrasound devices have been used to demonstrate a broad range of pathology in the hands of a sonographer or echocar- diographer (cardiovascular specialist with level II or III echocardio- graphic training), this document seeks to review the cardiac abnormalities that nonechocardiographer users have successfully identiﬁed. It is important to realize that most FCU studies are designed to evaluate the ability to image and interpret signiﬁcant abnormalities, such as moderate or severe deviations from normal. Most abnormal- ities are deﬁned by FCU users as present or absent. The broader ex- perience to characterize pathologies into severities of abnormality should not be expected with FCU. The available published studies are methodologically inconsistent in regard to the duration and nature of training, provider background, pa- tient population, devices used, and the clinical settings for the FCU ex- amination. The writing group reviewed studies, including at least 50 patients in whom a small platform was compared with traditional echo- cardiography or another criterion standard, with all images acquired and interpreted by physicians with no or minimal prior training in cardiac ul- trasound, to determine which pathologies a physician performing FCU can discern. The most commonly studied pathology that was adequately detected by using FCU was LV systolic dysfunction, in which sensitivities of 73%-100% and speciﬁcities of 64%-96% have been demonstrated. Other abnormalities with signiﬁcantly less validation include LVenlarge- ment, 48,49 LV hypertrophy, 30,50 LA enlargement, 48,51,52 RV enlargement, 30 pericardial effusion, 30,48,51 and IVC size. 30,53-57 Most importantly, although the ability to detect abnormalities at the bedside by FCU users is lower than having a comprehensive TTE, it is clearly better than traditional bedside assessment. FCU use allows detection of cardiac pathology more accurately than phys- ical examination, which supports its use as an adjunct to physical examination, not as a replacement for echocardiography. When used by physicians without formal echocardiographic training, FCU is superior to physical examination for the detection of cardiac abnor- malities, including LV enlargement, LV systolic dysfunction, LA en- largement, LV hypertrophy, pericardial effusion, and RA pressure elevation.30,39,49,53,58-61 5. FCU SCOPE OF PRACTICE As with any clinical tool, inappropriate application of FCU beyond a deﬁned scope of practice may have adverse consequences on pa- tient diagnoses, triage, and management. One paradigm is to use FCU routinely as an adjunct to the physical examination with every patient encounter. However, the impact of widespread use of FCU in all patient encounters that involve a physical examination has not been tested. The implications of following up on abnormalities de- tected by routine use of FCU at the time of physical examination, many of which would be false positives, needs to be considered. In addition, the potential impact of failure to refer symptomatic patients for complete echocardiographic evaluation, because of a ‘‘normal’’ FCU physical examination, needs to be considered. The infrastructure to educate and train all physicians who perform physical examination in FCU would be a massive undertaking. Although this may represent the future of cardiac examination, the introduction of FCU as an ad- junct to physical examination into speciﬁc clinical settings to answer a particular clinical question seems more prudent at this time. It seems that the greatest value of FCU is as an adjunct to the his- tory and physical examination in an attempt to provide more rapid and appropriate patient management in the early phases of his or her presentation. It is impractical to enumerate the speciﬁc clinical set- tings or patient conditions in which FCU-assisted physical examina- tion might prove useful. Rather, general clinical settings are described in which (1) an FCU trained clinician needs to assess a pa- tient at the bedside, (2) FCU would improve the clinician’s assessment over the tools that would otherwise be available, such as a stethoscope and one’s hands, and (3) echocardiography is not available, not avail- able quickly enough, or impractical. Although additional indications may be described, the focus of this discussion is limited to settings in which clinical value has been documented in the literature. The risk of a false-negative FCU examination that leads to delayed treat- ment or a false-positive examination that results in unnecessary treat- ment must be recognized. In these contexts, it is important to state that individuals performing FCU will be making direct interventions based upon their ﬁndings, just as they would based on their physical examination and basic lab- oratory ﬁndings. FCU is not just to detect disease, but clinicians will be able to act upon the ﬁndings. However, most studies that evaluate FCU have focused on evaluating image quality and accuracy to detect speciﬁc abnormalities in comparison with full-featured platforms and have not addressed the added value of FCU. There are limited data on the use of FCU by nonechocardiographer users to affect medical de- cision making or alter time to diagnosis and initiate treatment. There is a need to demonstrate in which setting FCU improves outcomes. Because FCU use directly affects patient care, it is imperative that cli- nicians keep to their scope of practice. Medically unwarranted over- use is a serious concern that justiﬁes the establishment of rigorous standards for training and scope of practice. a. FCU When Echocardiography is Not Promptly Available i. The need for clinical evaluation is emergent or urgent and echocardiography is not immediately available The need for emergent and/or urgent clinical evaluation may occur in patients with hemodynamic instability or chest trauma, and with ﬁndings that suggest the possibility of pericardial tamponade. These types of emergent evaluations generally are performed in the emer- gency department or the ICU. FCU in these settings clearly adds to Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography Volume 26 Number 6 Spencer et al 573 the bedside physical examination and can be performed immediately at the bedside.62 In patients who are critically ill, FCU has been shown to be helpful to traditional bedside assessment in determining volume status and LV systolic function.55,56,63-66 In patients who are hemodynamically unstable, FCU diagnoses may impact therapy in terms of the use of volume repletion, vasopressors, and inotropes, as well as diuretics and vasodilators. FCU may also be used to identify ﬁndings suggestive of pulmonary embolism (RV enlargement). Although RV enlargement lacks both sensitivity and speciﬁcity for pulmonary embolism; if present, this may alter triaging of further diagnostic testing. Findings from FCU are not deﬁnitive; the presence of ultrasound signs must be integrated with other bedside information to form an initial diagnostic impression that can then be pursued with alternative imaging or diagnostic modalities. Patients who have had cardiac arrest may also beneﬁt from FCU. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, FCU has been used to evalu- ate for large pericardial effusion suggestive of cardiac tamponade and to evaluate for cardiac standstill when deciding to cease resusci- tative efforts. FCU may help guide early post-arrest management by allowing rapid assessment of LV systolic function, pericardial tampo- nade, signs of pulmonary embolism, and volume status, all ﬁndings difﬁcult to conﬁrm by physical examination alone. In patients with chest trauma or ﬁndings consistent with pericardial tamponade, FCU can readily be used to identify the presence or absence of pericardial effusion. Comprehensive echocardiography should be performed for conﬁrmation of abnormal ﬁndings as well as evaluation of LV regional wall motion, valvular heart disease severity, and locu- lated pericardial effusions if clinically suspected. ii. Echocardiography not immediately available and the ﬁndings from FCU fa- cilitated physical examination would allow more rapid triage and directed clinical management In patients with acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF), FCU can be used to readily distinguish those with normal versus reduced LV systolic function as the cause of their congestive heart failure symp- toms and signs. It is clear that FCU is superior to traditional bedside evaluation, including physical examination, EKG, chest X-ray, and blood analysis for the detection of LV systolic dysfunction in patients with ADHF.58 Although these patients all need comprehensive echo- cardiography, the bedside use of FCU allows earlier knowledge of LV systolic function, which allows both initiation of appropriate therapies and avoidance of contraindicated therapies before the complete echocardiogram is done and reported. In 1 study of patients with ADHF, FCU allowed directed therapy to start 18 hours (on average) before a complete echocardiogram was performed and formally re- ported. 58 Another trial demonstrated reduced length of stay when a hospitalist used FCU to guide ADHF care. 67 b. FCU When Echocardiography is Not Practical i. Frequent serial examinations to follow up an ultrasound ﬁnding Very few echocardiographic parameters are worthwhile for assess- ing every day or multiple times a day for a period of time, such as dur- ing a hospitalization. It would be impractical to use traditional echocardiography for this purpose. Although a pericardial effusion may need serial assessment, repeated evaluation of this is best re- served for limited TTE not FCU. The knowledge base to interpret the hemodynamic effects of a pericardial effusion is beyond the scope of FCU. In addition, serial comparison of images, which is critical with pericardial effusions, is often difﬁcult with FCU systems. Knowledge of patient volume status (at least as measured by RA pressure), how- ever, is frequently assessed by physical examination and, therefore, suitable for FCU.68,69 Patients admitted with ADHF should have complete echocardiographic evaluation if it has not been performed recently. These patients may have uncertain volume status after initial diuresis. FCU assessment of the IVC is both more feasible and accurate than physical examination for detecting elevated central venous pressure.53 Evaluation of IVC size and pleth- ora with FCU has been successfully piloted in patients with ADHF and shown to be a predictor of hospital readmission.69 Patients in the ICU may have ﬂuctuation in volume status and/or LV or RV func- tion. FCU is readily applicable for use in serially monitoring a patient’s volume status and ventricular contractile function in the critical care area. ii. Physical examination adjunct in at-risk populations Physical examination may identify subjects who are asymptomatic but have a cardiac condition, but sensitivity is low. Echocardiography (comprehensive or limited) is not practical or reimbursed when used as an adjunct to physical examination. FCU is potentially an ideal technique to improve physical examination detection of cardiac dis- ease because FCU devices are portable and relatively inexpensive, and nonechocardiographer users can be trained to use them with rea- sonable accuracy. An appropriate pathology to identify would have the following characteristics: \u0001 Identiﬁable with FCU \u0001 Somewhat prevalent \u0001 Asymptomatic \u0001 Frequently missed by physical examination \u0001 Associated with signiﬁcant morbidity \u0001 Effective therapies exist for asymptomatic patients LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is an ideal target. It is reliably iden- tiﬁable with FCU and is somewhat prevalent, even in a population of asymptomatic subjects (2.0%-4.0%) but is often missed by physical examination and has effective therapy even in the preclinical stage.70,71 Results of several studies have shown the feasibility of FCU for identifying LV dysfunction in a variety of patient populations.45,51,58,59,63,64,72-76 A cost analysis study was performed, which suggested that using FCU in patients with an abnormal brain natriuretic peptide or EKG was the most cost- effective strategy for identifying asymptomatic LV dysfunction.77 However, unlike global LV dysfunction, assessment of regional wall motion may be challenging and is best assessed by echocardiography. In addition to LVSD, other echocardiographic ﬁndings can also identify patients at an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, such as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and in- creased left atrium (LA) size.78 Increased LV wall thickness and LA dimensions can be readily identiﬁed with FCU. 17,76 It is possible to perform an examination for LV dysfunction, LA enlargement, and LVH from the parasternal long-axis ultrasound view within seconds to a few minutes more accurately than the as- sessment of sustained apical impulses, or S3 or S4 gallops. Conﬁrmation of LVH and LA enlargement with echocardiographi- cally derived LV mass index and LA volume, which have established prognostic value, is appropriate. Using FCU in this way may also have prognostic implications.76 The addition of subcostal imaging of the IVC to estimate RA pressure to the parasternal appraisal of LV function and LA size is superior to inspection of the jugular ve- nous pulse and precordial assessment for LVSD and LA 574 Spencer et al Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography June 2013 enlargement.79 The appropriate setting and patient population for such examinations would need to be studied. Results of preliminary data suggest a reasonable yield in patients at higher risk for CV dis- ease, such as those patients in general medical inpatient wards.73 Whether the value of adding FCU to part of a routine physical ex- amination could be demonstrated in a healthier general outpatient population remains to be seen. c. eFCU In general, an experienced echocardiographer would use an echocar- diographic device with complete functionality to image cardiovascu- lar structures. The following situations occur when a level II/III trained echocardiographer with knowledge of comprehensive echocardiog- raphy uses a device that does not meet criteria for performing echo- cardiography. This use model is deﬁned as eFCU. Although not the focus of this guideline, these are brieﬂy described. i. Adjunct to physical examination Echocardiographers may ﬁnd FCU devices useful in their clinical practice in settings similar to other practitioners to supplement their physical examination assessments of patients. \u0001 The need for cardiac ultrasound is emergent or more urgent than when echocardiography is feasible 66,80,81 \u0001 Echocardiography is not immediately available and the ﬁndings from FCU would allow early triage and earlier directed clinical manage- ment 13,27,28,82-88 \u0001 Frequent serial examinations to follow up an ultrasound ﬁnding \u0001 During physical examination of at-risk populations in which there is a clini- cally relevant abnormality. Given the added expertise in image acquisition and interpretation, eFCU as an adjunct to physical examination has demon- strated the ability to detect LVH, 38,89 LVSD, 77,90 LA enlargement,90 abdom- inal aortic aneurysm,90,91 and carotid plaque. 90 ii. Assessing heart disease in underserved or remote populations in which echocardiographic platforms are not available The underserved population often have no or limited access to echocardiographic evaluation. Having an echocardiographer evaluate underserved patients with a small ultrasound device at the point of care opens a new vista for making diagnoses in patients who either have a long wait to get an echocardiogram at a public health facility (county hospital) or are unable to afford an echocardiogram.72 Small ultrasound platforms have been used to identify signiﬁcant myocardial disease such as LVH, reduced left ventricular ejection frac- tion, and valvular and congenital heart disease. This methodology has also been successfully used to image patients in remote locations.92-97 iii. Screening of athletes for potential causes of sudden cardiac death Screening of at-risk populations in which there is a low incidence of positive ﬁndings is another example in which a small device might provide a lower cost option to evaluate otherwise healthy individuals. An example of this type of screening would be the screening of ath- letes for potential causes of sudden cardiac death.98,99 An eFCU may allow identiﬁcation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is the most common cause of sudden death in this population. In this context, this is eFCU (not FCU) because the expertise in imaging and the expertise in image interpretation (to diagnose hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) are substantial. d. FCU Imaging Protocol The speciﬁc views to obtain and images to acquire may differ, de- pending on the clinical need,. At this point, a universal FCU examina- tion cannot be proposed. Factors to consider when designing an FCU protocol include \u0001 The limited functionality of hand-carried devices \u0001 Image acquisition skills of the examiner \u0001 Interpretation skills of the examiner \u0001 Disease states, given the device capabilities, image acquisition expertise, and interpretive training expertise that can be reliably detected \u0001 Pathologies that need to be conﬁrmed and/or excluded given the clinical question Some FCU clinical use models may only require 2D imaging. Although nonechocardiographer users can be taught to perform a color-Doppler examination, the clinical scenarios in which FCU has proven useful do not generally require use of color Doppler and spectral Doppler. There are very few situations in which the need to know about a regurgitant valvular lesion is more urgent than when echocardiography is feasible or requires frequent serial ex- amination that would be impractical for echocardiography. If an FCU clinical need were identiﬁed for Doppler, then the expertise to use these Doppler techniques responsibly would require additional didac- tic education, hands-on imaging, and maintenance of competency. FCU extended physical examination may be performed primarily from the parasternal and subcostal acoustic windows, which is consis- tent with 2 published ultrasound examinations that involve cardiac imaging as a part of their protocols. Both the Cardiopulmonary Limited Ultrasound Exam (CLUE) and Focused Abdominal Sonography in Trauma (FAST) examinations image the heart from the parasternal and subcostal windows only. As reviewed above, the expertise to acquire images from these windows is signiﬁcantly less than apical views. When assessing LV systolic function, there is a theoretical consideration that extensive apical abnormalities may not be appreciated if imaging is performed only from the parasternal window. Several studies have demonstrated that parasternal imaging is adequate for the subjective assessment of LV func- tion. 17,58,60,74,75,82,90 Imaging from subcostal and parasternal windows also requires minimal or no patient positioning or cooperation, which is key in many of the clinical scenarios in which FCU is likely to be useful. There may be cases in which an apical window may be the only window that gives useful images. It may be more prudent to wait for formal echocardiographic imaging than trying more difﬁcult win- dows to avoid the hazards of off-axis apical imaging. Apical imaging can easily lead to overestimation of left ventricle ejection fraction by foreshortening and to a false conclusion of RV dilatation by obtain- ing an RV modiﬁed apical 4-chamber image rather than a true apical 4-chamber image. However, FCU use models may be developed in which the apical views are required. If apical imaging is needed, then it should be included in the training (didactic, hands on, and in- terpretive). It is imperative to recognize that imaging from additional views and acquiring supplemental images does not change an FCU augmented physical examination into an echocardiographic exami- nation. The difference between these techniques lies in the expecta- tions of the examination, the equipment used, the expertise in image acquisition and proﬁciency in data analysis and interpretation (section 3.), not in the number of images acquired, patient position during ex- amination, or windows from which imaging was performed. Depending on the specialty of the practitioner, FCU may only be a portion of a specialty’s bedside ultrasound protocol. For example, the FAST examination in trauma involves ultrasound of the heart, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Imaging in the critical area may include noncardiac targets, such as lung water, ascites, hydronephrosis, and Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography Volume 26 Number 6 Spencer et al 575 pleural effusions. This guideline is not meant to cover extracardiac imaging protocols. It would be expected that multiorgan protocols that involve cardiac imaging would adhere to the guidelines set forth for the cardiac portion of their imaging protocol. One could imagine modules of training for different aspects of bedside ultrasound use. e. Quantiﬁcation Quantitative assessment is a core component of echocardiography, whether complete or limited. There are detailed documents about how to properly measure the cardiac chambers, ventricular perfor- mance, valvular lesions, and vessels.7,9-12 Devices used for FCU imaging have a variable degree of measurement capabilities. These devices have shown reasonable accuracy when used by novices to quantify LVH, LA size, and LV dimensions. 47,50,100 However, making measurements has several disadvantages during FCU. Learning how to make even basic measurements adds to the duration of didactic and practical training. Pausing during a bedside assessment to quantify the size of a cardiac structure or to compute a calculation adds delay to a procedure for which rapid bedside evaluation is one of its major strengths. The lack of an ECG gating with some FCU devices increases the chance of making an inaccurate measurement. Lastly, for the scope of practice in which FCU has been used, quantiﬁcation is simply not necessary. The bedside decisions facilitated by FCU can generally be made by using subjective categorization of abnormalities into broad ranges of severity. Knowing if LV systolic function is normal, reduced, or se- verely reduced allows immediate therapeutic decisions to be made in a patient admitted with ADHF. Most clinicians would like to know if a pericardial effusion and RV are normal, large, or very large rather than a quantitative measurement. The LA has well- documented subjective interpretation criteria that correlate well with criterion standards. 52,101 f. Image Archival and Reporting Devices currently used for FCU examinations all store images inter- nally. The storage format varies from device to device, as does the ease of image integration with enterprise digital storage systems. The documentation (both image and report) of FCU examinations is dependent on clinical use. The writing group’s recommendation is that images performed to evaluate a symptomatic patient to direct management because formal echocardiography is not available should be stored to a retrievable location. Ideally, this would be on the same digital storage system where the clinical echocardiography images are stored. Storage of these images is useful for both quality assurance (for the FCU clinician) and for assessment of changes by comparison with the formal echocardiographic ﬁndings. All FCU examination results must be documented in the patient chart and/or electronic medical record. Parameters should include the same items recorded for a physical examination: \u0001 Date and time of examination \u0001 Name and hospital identiﬁcation number of the patient \u0001 Patient age, date of birth, and sex \u0001 Name of the person who performed and/or interpreted the study \u0001 Findings If the FCU examination is noted within the physical examination portion of the chart, then most of these items are likely present and only the ﬁndings need to be documented. Studies performed to evaluate a symptomatic patient to direct management because formal echocardiography is not available, should, in addition, include the following: \u0001 Indication for the study \u0001 Impression (including when a study is nondiagnostic) \u0001 Mode of archiving the data (where can the images be found to be viewed) Images from an FCU examination performed for serial evaluation of the IVC or ventricular function in a patient with a prior comprehen- sive echocardiogram need not be saved. Ideally, signiﬁcant changes in serial ﬁndings would prompt referral for limited echocardiography. Images performed as part of an extended physical examination in a patient at risk for cardiac disease (but no cardiac symptoms) need not be saved either, but abnormal ﬁndings should prompt referral for echocardiography. This is consistent with current cardiac physical examination techniques such as inspection, palpation and ausculta- tion, the presence or absence of signs are documented but without mandatory recording of pictorial, video, or audio information despite the modern capability to do so. The ﬁndings from FCU in these set- tings should be formally documented in the patient’s chart. The results of FCU can be easily recorded within the physical examination por- tion in the medical record, akin to the handling of visual bedside in- formation obtained through use of the ophthalmoscope or otoscope, thereby setting appropriate physician and patient expecta- tions of this bedside technique. Mandatory video archival and formal reporting of FCU examinations for these indications would unneces- sarily increase the time needed for examination and create an unnec- essary burden on digital storage within the electronic health record. 6. TRAINING RECOMMENDATIONS The development of FCU devices offers the opportunity to provide a quick snapshot view of the heart at the bedside. Although the de- vices and protocols are less complex than standard echocardiography, the training and oversight required to develop the skills necessary to perform and interpret FCU studies must not be minimized. Although speciﬁc training requirements (duration, number of studies, etc) are not offered, this document provides a framework from which the medical community can establish the criteria necessary to optimize the use of this exciting new technology. There are a number of articles that demonstrate acceptable accu- racy of nonechocardiographer users who performed FCU from which one could surmise that the training protocol used was ade- quate.30,45,48-56,58,59,63-65,72-75,102 However, the heterogeneity in these studies makes it difﬁcult to draw speciﬁc conclusions. The training protocols differed with respect to the background of the trainees, the ultrasound device used, the hours and content of didactic lectures, acoustic windows imaged from, the number of ultrasound examinations performed, percentage of proctored examinations, subjects imaged (volunteers, patients), clinical setting (echocardiography laboratory, ward, clinic, ICU), which cardiac ﬁndings were evaluated (LV function, atrial size, etc), whether assessment was subjective or quantitative, and the criterion standard used. Studies that evaluated the acquisition of FCU skills by novice users (residents) found an ‘‘acceptable’’ level of skill in performing and interpreting FCU studies might be obtainable with 20-30 studies if the scope of acquisition and interpretation were limited.47,103 Although there may be a perception that FCU examinations are ‘‘easier’’ to perform, this is not necessarily the case. It is true that there 576 Spencer et al Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography June 2013 are fewer controls and settings to master. An FCU examination in- volves a reduced number of windows and can be performed without knowledge of more advanced ultrasound technologies (Doppler, strain, 3D, etc). However, one should also take into account that the transducers might require extra skill due to their limited process- ing power, poorer penetration, and lower number of scanning ele- ments, which results in a more challenging proposition to obtain clear images. The size and quality of the screens on FCU systems are inferior compared with full-size systems, and they may be more sensitive to viewing angle and light conditions. It is also inopportune that the clinical situations in which an FCU examination might prove most useful are frequently settings that have subjects with the poorest acoustic windows. ICU settings with limited patient mobility and pos- sibly mechanical ventilation are difﬁcult to image even by skilled echocardiographers. 104 Trauma, drains, and bandages in patients who are acutely ill can limit image acquisition even with full- featured platforms. a. Background Although training for FCU can begin in medical school, FCU use should be limited to licensed physicians. It is expected that physicians with diverse training backgrounds could use FCU in patient care. The scope of this document is limited to the use of FCU in the care and management of adult patients, and, therefore, physicians should be trained in an adult medical or surgical specialty. By nature, FCU tech- nology is used at the patient bedside during clinical evaluation and management, so practitioners in radiology are not addressed in this document. It is our recommendation that physicians who have com- pleted training in internal medicine, hospital medicine, emergency medicine, anesthesia, critical care medicine, or cardiovascular surgery would have an appropriate background to pursue training in FCU. b. Training Environment A formal structured training program is the best approach to equip physicians with the necessary knowledge and technical skills to per- form FCU. Instruction in an FCU course or program should focus not only on providing education but also on assessing competency. Clinicians who seek FCU training should do so within an accredited graduate medical education or continuing education program. It ap- pears feasible and appropriate to begin FCU training in medical school curriculums, where it can be taught in conjunction with history and physical examination training. Bedside ultrasound evaluation, in- cluding FCU, may become part of a core curriculum for resident train- ing. To better ensure success, FCU educational programs should collaborate locally with an Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Echocardiography Laboratories accredited echocar- diography laboratory. Although portions of training may be done at courses and online, collaborating with certiﬁed sonographers and the National Board of Echocardiography certiﬁed echocardiographers offers the opportunity to be trained and supported by experts in com- prehensive echocardiography. The exposure to the breadth of pathol- ogy required to gain experience is best acquired when there is access to the volume of cases performed in a busy laboratory. The quality as- surance procedures in place at an accredited echocardiography facil- ity can be expanded to provide oversight for an FCU program. c. Components of a Training Program - Didactic Education Recommendations for cardiac ultrasound training for nonechocar- diographers include 3 core components: didactic education, hands- on image acquisition, and image interpretation experience. There are important considerations in each of these areas that prior guide- lines have not comprehensively addressed. Guidelines should be speciﬁc in the knowledge component of FCU training. Background topics should include ultrasound physics and ba- sic cardiac anatomy with the corresponding ultrasound views. The pathophysiology of the common clinical conditions in the trainee’s scope of practice should be reviewed, speciﬁcally with regard to the effects these conditions have on cardiac function and structure. Clinical topics will be tailored to the users but should include appro- priate clinical use scenarios and imaging protocols. This component is the integration of the cardiac anatomy, pathophysiology with the FCU imaging capabilities, and scope of practice. The indications for FCU versus comprehensive and/or limited echocardiography should be re- viewed. Practitioners should get a solid understanding of the appropri- ate scope of practice by understanding the limitations of FCU imaging equipment as well as the scope of their image acquisition and inter- pretation training. The value of FCU in speciﬁc clinical scenarios should be demonstrated by using case studies and image correlations. Common abnormalities encountered with FCU should be reviewed. In an effort to accommodate a trainee’s limited schedule, the didac- tic contents of the training could potentially be delivered as hybrid learning modules with a combination of traditional class lectures and online interactive modules. The online module should have a posttest component to ensure that all trainees are prepared for hands-on practice. For spatial training, the use of imaging aids such as 3D cardiac models, phantom imaging, and simulation mannequins may expedite the understanding of scanning planes and their corre- sponding anatomy. Review of digital-video loops and still frames of normal cases, which show the recommended scanning views and nor- mal variants should be included. The trainee should be familiarized with different chest conformations and possible deviations from the typical scanning windows. It is important to complete this portion of the training before pro- ceeding to hands-on experience to allow the participant to become familiar with terminology, probe orientation, and views. To maximize the value of the didactic training, the hands-on practice should pro- ceed within a reasonable period of time. Extending the training period outside a predetermined window would be deleterious to compe- tency outcomes. 47 d. Components of a Training Program - Hands-on Training There is signiﬁcant variation in the consideration of cardiac ultrasound simulation as a viable alternative to hands-on training. It is the opinion of this writing group and the ASE that, although ultrasound simulators may be used as adjunct in FCU training, the majority of hands-on studies should be performed on human subjects. There is simply no adequate way to simulate the wide range in patient body habitus, chest wall structure, translational motion of the heart due to respira- tion, heart orientation within the chest, cardiac size, patient coopera- tion, and normal variants with simulation. Training with normal subjects is common in FCU training settings. The use of normal volunteers and/or having trainees image each other serves as a quick way to gain hands-on experience. It is the opin- ion of this writing group and the ASE that the majority of hands-on image experience be acquired in patients, preferably in the clinical arena where the physician practices or in subjects similar to those in the physician’s practice setting. Initially, imaging in normal subjects who have excellent windows and are cooperative in their positioning and respiration is a good way to learn acoustic windows, imaging Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography Volume 26 Number 6 Spencer et al 577 planes, transducer manipulation, and basic anatomy. However, expe- rience imaging at the bedside in real-life settings is invaluable. There is ambiguity in how the hands-on experience should be su- pervised in other guidelines. It is the recommendation of this writing group that a portion of hands-on studies be proctored in real time. Immediate feedback while acquiring images from an experienced im- ager is critical to success. Acquisition of images in the presence of a proctor and independent acquisition of images are both necessary experiences. Although most guidelines recommend independent image acquisi- tion as a core component of training, there is often ambiguity in the setting in which this occurs. The ASE recommends that a signiﬁcant number of examinations should be performed with the device (or de- vice with similar capabilities) that the physician will be using for FCU and performed on patients in clinical settings typical of the trainee’s scope of practice. Training with a full-featured device on selected sta- ble outpatients, for example, does not prepare a clinician to image pa- tients who are critically ill and intubated with a small portable bedside device. Lastly, most guidelines fail to specify the equipment requirement used for hands-on training. It is recommended that the majority of hands-on image cases be acquired with the device (or a device with similar capabilities) that the physician will be using for FCU examinations. Initial experience in an echocardiography laboratory on a high-end platform may prove useful to gain conﬁdence and ac- quire familiarity with acoustic windows; however, experience must be primarily acquired with the device that will be used for FCU imaging. e. Components of a Training Program - Image Interpretation Trainees should keep records of documented cases where he or she performed the FCU protocol and prepared a complete interpretation. A practitioner proﬁcient in FCU or echocardiography should review these scans. Any discrepancy of interpretation should be communi- cated to the trainee as part of an ongoing learning experience. This could be done at the local institution where a qualiﬁed reviewer is in- volved, or images could be sent to a central reviewing body. All im- ages (loops and frames) stored for review should be deidentiﬁed and comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations if submitted to an external reviewer. They should be able to recognize the abnormalities and normal struc- tures within the scope of their FCU practice. It is clear that the variety of pathologies experienced during hands- on training and expert review is likely to be a subset of the scope of pathologies and normal variants seen in the clinical setting. Review of additional cases is essential. Ideally, this should be provided through didactic review of images or in a self-education review of images se- lected to represent normal variants and pathologies relevant to the scope of practice. Salient features of the images should be provided with teaching points. Speciﬁc lists of cases and/or abnormalities could be developed to represent the normal variants and expected pathol- ogies within a variety of FCU scopes of practice. f. Documentation and Maintenance of Competency and Quality Assurance Speciﬁc recommendations for documentation of competency cannot be made at this time. Once formal training recommendations are de- veloped, presumably, documentation of competency will involve documentation of the completion of the core components of a train- ing program (didactic education, hands-on imaging, and interpretive skill). There are no current objective metrics or validated tools to de- termine competency in FCU. Current guidelines and training require- ments are based on hours or months in training and the number of ultrasounds performed and/or interpreted, which are used as surro- gates of competency. 105-109 There unfortunately is a weak correlation between the number of studies interpreted and the months of training with interpretation accuracy. 110 The correlation be- tween cardiac studies scanned with interpretation and scanning abil- ities is better, which supports a curriculum that is replete with practical hands-on imaging. Other work has demonstrated that acquisition skills were acquired more slowly than interpretive skills. 47 An FCU training program should emphasize safety and require ample hands- on training and exposure to pathology before considering an individ- ual without echocardiography training competent to use these tools appropriately. Maintenance of competency is a separate issue from the achieve- ment of proﬁciency. It is well known that skill level declines unless a technique is regularly implemented and reinforced. Continued ex- cellence in FCU requires ongoing performance of FCU, exposure to a variety of clinical situations and pathology, and staying up to date with advances in the ﬁeld. To maintain scanning and interpretation skills, a minimum number of studies performed annually will need to be determined. FCU practitioners are encouraged to routinely fol- low up on the complete echocardiographic ﬁndings. Likewise, echo- cardiography laboratories that perform complete echocardiographic examinations and have access to the results of the prior FCU should communicate missed or misinterpreted ﬁndings to the FCU practitioner informally through verbal communication. Additional accredited continuing medical education courses or approved self- assessment programs directly related to FCU should also play a role in maintenance of competency.
