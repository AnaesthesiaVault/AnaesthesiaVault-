In TRICS WL, the restrictive arm received packed red blood cells to target an Hb <7.5g/dL at all points of time, whereas the liberal arm targeted Hb <9.5g/dL whilst in theatre or ICU, or an Hb <8.5g/dL whilst the patients were in the ward. The primary outcome was a composite of: death from any cause, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident or new onset acute kidney injury which required dialysis, by the time of hospital discharge or at 28 days. There was no difference in the primary composite outcome between the 2 groups, and a non-slgnificant trend to a reduction in mortality in the restrictive group. Sub group analysis revealed that a restrictive strategy was associated with a reduction in the primary composite outcome in elderly patients 275 years [OR 0.70; 95%Cl 0.54-0.89]. There was no benefit of a restrictive strategy in younger patients <75 years. Paediatrics With regards to the data in paediatric critical care patients, red cell transfusion Is assoclated with an even higher complication rate than in adults (37 complications per 100 000 red blood cell units Issued for infants younger than 12 months; 18 complications per 100 000 red blood cell units issued for children younger than 18 years; and 13 complications per 100 000 red blood cell units issued for adults). Paediatric literature demonstrates a higher mortality in critically ill children who are transfused, of concern is that the greatest mortality is seen in the children who were less sick, indicating that red cell transfusion in this population is independently associated with increased mortality (Kneyber 2007 - see Figure 2). 15 2 2 £ 10 z www Trans fusion g == No transfusion 5 s ] o <0.01 0.0170.05 0.05-0.15 0.15-0.30 >0.30 Probability of death (POD) strata Figure 2.
