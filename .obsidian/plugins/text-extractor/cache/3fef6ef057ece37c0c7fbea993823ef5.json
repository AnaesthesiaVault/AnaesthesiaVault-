This results in retraction and fixation of the tricuspid and pulmonary valve leaflets. Tricuspid regurgitation is found in almost all cases, but tricuspid stenosis and both pulmonary regurgitation and stenosis may occur. The pathogenesis of the plaque is not completely understood. The plaque is composed of smooth muscle cells, myofibroblasts and an overlying endothelial cell layer. The diet drugs, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, which interfere with serotonin metabolism produce cardiac valve lesions very similar to carcinoid lesions.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
