Managing anaemia eg. Early detection, minimising oxygen consumption, support haematopoiesis with pharmacological therapy 2. Interdisciplinary blood conservation modalities e.g. Meticulous surgical techniques, minimise volume of blood used in laboratory testing, rapidly diagnose blood loss and stop it 3. Optimising haemostasis e.g. Measures to assess coagulation status and goal-directed therapy to correct coagulopathy 4. Patient-centred decision making e.g. Inform patients of risks, benefits and alternatives of treatment choices. Although PBM has been largely applied in the perioperative setting, it is also finding a firm foothold in the management of the critically ill patient. Ina nutshell... What can we conclude from the trials of restrictive transfusion triggers? 1. Restrictive strategies in critically ill patients do not appear to be associated with harm 2. In the critically ill, one should consider transfusion of red cells if Hb <7g/dL 3. Do not transfuse as a method to increase oxygen delivery, this doesnâ€™t work! 4. For acute coronary syndromes and is cardiac surgical patients, a target of <8g/dL is probably acceptable 5. For paediatric critically ill patients, consider red cell transfusion if Hb <6g/dL. 6. For post-operative high risk patients consider red cell transfusion if Hb <8g/dL s More data is needed to definitively guide transfusion triggers in the perioperative patient; however, a transfusion trigger of 7-7.5g/dL may be associated with increased mortality in this group 7. It is probably more appropriate to manage each patient according to the premise of PRECISION MEDICINE whereby, rather than a knee-jerk transfusion to a specific transfusion trigger, each case must be assessed on its own merits and the risks and benefits of autologous transfusion should be made.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
