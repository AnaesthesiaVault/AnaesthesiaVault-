Positive pressure ventilation triggers pathophysiological mechanisms which may lead to ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) even in healthy lungs. The cyclical opening and closing of respiratory units (due to high pressures or volumes) damages the alveolar capillary membrane and extracellular matrix and induces mechanotransduction (the process whereby physical stimuli are converted into biochemical signals and inflammatory mediators). There is increasing recognition that normal lungs may benefit from lung protective ventilation and that any positive pressure ventilation can be harmful! Much of the following section relates to minimising postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), which are indicative of lung injury. How VLI is caused Although not new (the concept of lung stress and strain has been described for around 20 years) there is further understanding that these mechanical engineering concepts are the cornerstone of the pathophysiological processes underlying VILI. In terms of mechanics, stress is a function of the tension across a structure (trans-structural tension) and is expressed as the force per unit area of a structure. It has the same unit of measurement as pressure. The application of high levels of stress to the lungs disrupts the normal functioning of cells, and large stressors release inflammatory mediators and metalloproteinases which further damage the delicate alveoli. When the applied forces are very high, such changes may not be so subtle, with overt mechanical destruction of the fibro-elastic matrix of the alveoli. In pulmonary mechanics, stress relates to the stress across the whole lung, which is known as the transpulmonary pressure. Transpulmonary pressure (P,) = static airway pressure — pleural pressure This can be simplified as: P, = Plateau pressure — pleural pressure","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
