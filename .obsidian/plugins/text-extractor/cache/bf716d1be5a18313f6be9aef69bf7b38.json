When using opiates as part of a nitrous-narcotic technique or for cardiac anesthesia, the dosing scheme listed under anesthesia is used. When the opiate is combined as part of balanced anesthesia, dosing listed for analgesia is needed.\" t “For analgesia or during sedation, an initial loading dose of remifentanil should not be given because its very rapid onset may result in apnea or muscle rigidity.™*","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
