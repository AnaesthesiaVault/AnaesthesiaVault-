{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240214122030.png","text":"Hyperoxia and sepsis There have been some suggestions in the literature that hyperoxia may be of clinical benefit in the early management of septic shock. The rationale for hyperoxia as therapy includes: s Enhanced antimicrobial host defense due to bactericidal effects of ROS * Hyperoxia induced vasoconstriction may improve haemodynamics in septic shock during the period of vasodilatation and vasoplegia o Possible attenuation of early acute hyperinflammatory response. Animal studies Trials of hyperoxia in porcine septic shock have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects and attenuation of organ dysfunction. Ovine studies have demonstrated improved macro- and microcirculatory haemodynamics in a faecal peritonitis model. The benefits seem most marked when hyperoxia is initiated simultaneously with septic shock, rather than after the insult, which is not very helpful in the clinical arena! Human studies Studies of sepsis and oxygen therapy yield interesting findings. The HYPERS2S trial [a 2x2 factorial trial which looked at the effects of an F,0, of 1.0 and hypertonic saline in patients with septic shock] was terminated early due to an increase in mortality and serious adverse events in patients treated with an F,0, of 1.0 {Asfar ~ Lancet Respir Med 2017). Studies (and expert opinion) suggest that oxygen therapy should be tailored depending on the stage of sepsis. During the acute phase of septic shock, oxygen therapy should probably be instituted to prevent pulmonary hypertension, but in distributive shock, the issue is of peripheral hypoperfusion with altered oxygen extraction â€” and in this stage, HYPERS2S suggests that additional oxygen therapy is harmful.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
