As the patient exercises, the increase in oxygen consumption (horizontal axis) is plotted against the heart rate (green dots, left vertical axis) and the minute ventilation (V,,, orange dots, right vertical axis). Nor- mal responses for heart rate and ventilation lie within the green and orange lines. The vertical dashed line is the predicted upper limit of normal based on age. Patients with primarily cardiac causes for exercise limitation will show an excessive increase in heart rate with exercise. Patients with primarily respiratory limitation will show a disproportionate increase in ventilation. Patients with pulmonary vascular disease will have both abnormal heart rate and ventilation responses. (Reprinted from Patterson [101], with permission).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
