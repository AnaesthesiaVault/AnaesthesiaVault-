ROTEM coagulation profiles in health parturients and in parturients with obstetric coagulopathy owing to severe PPH [62]. Schematic representations of healthy (a) and coagulopathic (b) ROTEM coagulation profiles for EXTEM and FIBTEM tests. Tissue factor is used in EXTEM assays for assessment of the extrinsic pathway. A platelet inhibitor, cytochalasin, is added to the blood sample for the FIBTEM assay to differentiate between platelet dysfunction and the alterations in fibrin polymerization. A5/A10/A15/A20, clot amplitude at 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after CT has passed; CT, clotting time; EXTEM, extrinsically activated assay with tissue factor; FIBTEM, extrinsically activated test with tissue factor and the platelet inhibitor cytochalasin D; MCF, maximum clot firmness; PPH, postpartum hemorrhage; ROTEM, rotational thromboelastomeiry.
