{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240529075325.png","text":"Seek information Patient safety first Initiative Escalate: to senior colleague Support: support colleagues and ensure their safety Advice / framework for the impaired colleague: 1. Be clear at the opening the reason for the meeting. State what you observed or have been told and that you want to find out what stressors are going on in their life or if there is anything you can do to help. This is likely to be a situation which is completely out of character. 2. Listen. 3. Listen some more. 4. Explore stressors: family, money, drugs, ETOH, work, health etc. 5. Explicitly check for mental health issues. Doctors are a high risk cohort for suicide. 6. Work out what supports your colleague has, what is their ongoing plan. 7. If they are impaired or turn up to work drunk this is reportable. This is not negotiable but you can help them self report. Also each state will have their own doctor support group, encourage them to call and arrange transport to get them to an appointment. 8. Encourage the use of sick leave and that the details of the conversation can be kept private. All the Head of Department needs to know is that they are sick. Obviously it would be good if they emailed, called or allowed you to at least contact the Head of Department to provide some additional details. 9. Summarise your plan and allow time for questions.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
