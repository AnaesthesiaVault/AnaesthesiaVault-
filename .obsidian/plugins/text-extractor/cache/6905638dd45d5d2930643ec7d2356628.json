It is a clinical emergency characterized by a massive disordered autonomic response to certain stimuli below the level of the lesion, such as bladder and bowel disten- sion. The clinical manifestations include: * an increase in blood pressure of at least 20%, * headache, o flushing, * sweating, e chills, * nasal congestion, piloerection, pallor. Severe hypertension can lead to raised intracranial pressure re- sulting in seizures and intracranial haemorrhage, and cardiac complications including myocardial ischaemia, arrhythmias, and pulmonary oedema. Factors affecting the development of ADR include level of the spinal injury, duration of injury, and whether the injury is com- plete or incomplete. The incidence of ADR is between 50% and 70% in patients with lesions above T6* and increases in frequency with higher level lesions and complete lesions. There are reports of ADR with lesions as low as T10; however, symptoms are less severe in patients with lower lesions. Although it is most com- monly observed in the chronic stage of CSI (a year after injury), early episodes can occur within weeks of injury, and 10% of pa- tients with lesions above T6 experience ADR within first year of injury.‚Äù The pathophysiology of ADR is thought to be a result of a dis- organized sympathetic response to stimuli below the level of the lesion (Fig. 1). Normal regulation of sympathetic output from the spinal cord is modulated by input from higher centres. Interrup- tion within the spinal cord results in loss of this higher input. Spinal circuits below the lesion are established and result in","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
