Hypoxia reduces basal nitric oxide production and thus HPV is enhanced Prostacyclin Prostacyclin is a vasodilator that stimulates cyclic adenylate cyclase and increases cyclic adenine monophosphate production Endothelin-1 Endothelin-1 is a small peptide paracrine mediator with potent vasoconstrictor properties. It acts via G-protein receptors on PASMCs","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
