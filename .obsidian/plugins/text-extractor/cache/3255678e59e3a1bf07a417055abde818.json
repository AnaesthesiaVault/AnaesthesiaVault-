We recommend using a target tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight compared with 12mL/kg in adult patients with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). 9. We recommend using an upper limit goal for plateau pressures of 30cm H,0 over higher plateau pressures in adult patients with sepsis-induced severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 3. We suggest using higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) over lower PEEP in adult patients with sepsis-induced moderate to severe ARDS (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 4.We suggest using recruitment maneuvers in adult patients with sepsis-induced, severe ARDS (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 5. We recommend using prone over supine position in adult patients with sepsis-induced ARDS and a Pao,/Fio, ratio < 150 (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 6. We recommend against using high-frequency oscillatory ventiation in adult patients with sepsis-induced ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 7. We make no recommendation regarding the s of noninvasive ventilation for patients with sepsis-induced ARDS. 8. We suggest using neuromuscular blocking agents for < 48 hours in adult patients with sepsis-induced ARDS and a Pao,/Fio, ratio < 150mm Hg (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 9. We recommend a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established sepsis-induced ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
