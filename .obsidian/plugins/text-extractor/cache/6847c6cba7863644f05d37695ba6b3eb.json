Since courses were not locally available, the time and costs to obtain and maintain FCU training represented a major barrier. For those who did attend an external course, their skills had lapsed due to the lack of ongoing local mentorship. As part of a quality improvement project to target obstetric anes- thesiologists in our department who are FCU novices, we developed and administered a local course speciﬁc to the assessment of obstetric patients, termed the ‘Focused Cardiac Ultrasound in the Obstetric Patient (FCU-op)’. This initiative was not intended to replace formal courses that already exist, nor to establish practice competency among attendees. Instead, it was inspired by our desire to encourage all anes- thesiologists in our department to develop an interest, and to equip them with basic knowledge and skills, in FCU. Our primary goal was to establish an in-house course that was free, accessible, and led by a ‘local expert’ who could be approached easily to foster collegial intradepartmental learning. The ‘FCU-op’ course consisted of reading materials based on FCU guidelines and recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography,5–7 a multiple-choice questionnaire (MCQ), and an in-person workshop. An obstetric anesthesiology fellow with fellow- ship training in cardiac anesthesiology and certiﬁcation in echocardio- graphy (JB), and a fellowship-trained obstetric anesthesiologist with prior FCU training (AC), co-developed this course. The workshop com- prised didactic lectures with image interpretation and hands-on skill stations. Eight anesthesiologists with no prior training in FCU partici- pated in the course (FCU-op group). Eight non-obstetric anesthesiolo- gist physicians with no prior FCU training who did not attend the course also completed the MCQ (control group). Course participants were asked to complete reading materials and a 20-item pre-workshop MCQ (see supplement). A post-workshop MCQ was administered immediately after the workshop. The MCQ ques- tions assessed knowledge acquired in the workshop. To assess knowl- edge retention, the same MCQ was administered at three and six months post-workshop, but the order of answer choices was random- ized. Adequate knowledge retention was deﬁned as an MCQ score ≥80%. Additionally, course participants were asked to report their conﬁdence at independently acquiring and interpreting FCU images using a Likert scale (none=1; low=2; moderate=3; good=4; high=5). The primary outcome was the MCQ score at six months post-work- shop compared with immediately post-workshop scores, analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired data. The secondary outcome was the change in scores over time for the FCU-op group analyzed using mixed-effects regression. Participant demographics are presented in Table 1. The mean MCQ score immediately post-workshop was signiﬁcantly higher than pre- workshop (95% vs. 90%, P=0.03). A decrease in the mean MCQ score was evident at three months, and post-hoc pairwise Tukey’s tests sug- gest that there was a signiﬁcant difference between scores immedi- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoa.2021.103233 0208-5216/© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

At six months, the mean score of the FCU- op group remained signiﬁcantly higher than that of the control group (79.4% vs. 56.3%, P=0.002). There was a signiﬁcant overall effect of time (likelihood ratio test P=0.02). Participants’ self-rating of their ability in image acquisition and interpretation was highest three months post-workshop (median [range] score of 3 [2–4]) but this had started to decline at six months post-workshop (2.5 [2–4]). As demonstrated by the mean MCQ score, obstetric anesthesiolo- gists who have no prior FCU training adequately retained basic FCU knowledge for at least three months. However, there was a signiﬁcant decay of mean MCQ score at six months, suggesting that repeating this initiative every six months, at least initially, would be necessary. Study limitations include the small sample size, non-randomized design, and the use of a MCQ that may simply be testing knowledge recall. Fur- thermore, we did not assess competency, skill retention, or the rate of clinical adoption post-workshop. Participants may have not achieved or retained competency in performing and interpreting a FCU on a pregnant patient. Despite these limitations, we hope by shar- ing our experience, it may inspire other centers to develop a local FCU initiative so that all anesthesiologists within the department can ben- eﬁt. Centers like ours with many FCU novices would be more likely to see the greatest beneﬁt. Ultimately, developing a local initiative will depend on speciﬁc skillsets of the personnel within a department. Existing FCU training guidelines will help departments identify an internal FCU expert and provide guidance as to what it takes to lead and sustain such an effort.5–8 Funding This research did not receive any speciﬁc grant from funding agen- cies in the public, commercial, or not-for-proﬁt sectors.
