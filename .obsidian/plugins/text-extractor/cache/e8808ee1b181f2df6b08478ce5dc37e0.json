Design: A prospective observational study of all patients having a focused cardiovascular ultrasound (FoCUS). Setting: A single tertiary referral university teaching hos- pital. Participants: Fifty consecutive perioperative patients who had a clinical indication for a FoCUS. Interventions: After performing a FoCUS, relevant clinical information was communicated to the anesthesiologist in charge of the case, who then decided on the appropriate management of the patient including the choice of anesthe- sia, invasive monitoring, ﬂuids, vasoactive drugs, and post- operative care. If indicated, patients were referred for a formal cardiology-based transthoracic echocardiogram. Measurements and Main Results: Anesthesiologists were able to obtain diagnostic-quality images during a FoCUS in 98% of patients. The most common indication for a FoCUS was an undifferentiated ejection systolic murmur in 50% of cases, with 38% of all patients having aortic stenosis. In 84% of patients, some change in their perioperative care occurred as a result of the FoCUS study. Major ﬁndings correlated with a formal cardiology- based transthoracic echocardiogram in 87% of cases. Conclusion: Anesthesiologists with a cardiac and echocar- diography background can successfully perform a FoCUS in almost all patients when indicated, which provides valuable new diagnostic information guiding changes in periopera- tive management in the majority of patients.

KEY WORDS: focused transthoracic echocardiography, an- esthesiologist, perioperative U LTRASOUND APPLICATIONS in perioperative care have expanded exponentially over the past 2 decades. Its use in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE),1 vascular access,2 and regional anesthesia3 have become well established. As yet, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) has not become a rou- tine part of anesthesia care, and its use has traditionally been limited to a cardiology-run echocardiography service. With a busy echo laboratory and increasing demands, waitlist times for TTE have increased steadily,4 and stafﬁng levels often do not permit rapid deployment of personnel and equipment to the operating room on short notice. Increasingly, TTE has been performed by noncardiology services, and its use is well described in emergency medicine5 and in the intensive care unit (ICU).6 Unlike a full cardiology- based TTE, which often takes 45 to 60 minutes to complete, the concept of a focused goal-directed TTE has emerged that targets a speciﬁc clinical problem in question and often can be performed in around 10 minutes.7 The aim of such a study is not to replace a formal comprehensive cardiology-based TTE but to noninvasively enhance the clinical assessment and im- mediately evaluate issues that are not detectable easily by physical examination alone.8 Despite the increasing availability of portable ultrasound platforms with TTE capability, implementation of this technol- ogy by anesthesiologists has been limited in the perioperative setting, partly by the lack of formal TTE training opportunities. The Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand recom- mends performing 150 studies and interpreting a further 300 before independent practice.9 This is similar to guidelines from the American Society of Echocardiography, including so-called “hand-carried” portable devices10 and intraoperative TEE.11 The evidence base supporting the numbers in these guidelines is at best limited. Many anesthesiologists now have extensive training, expe- rience, and qualiﬁcations in the more invasive TEE, but there are as yet little published data on their use of TTE. This study was designed to assess the feasibility, clinical impact, and limitations of a focused perioperative TTE service performed by anesthesiologists on noncardiac surgical patients in the perioperative period in a busy academic tertiary referral center. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective study of the ﬁrst 50 patients who had a clinical indication for a focused TTE between May 2007 and May 2008 was undertaken. This was approved by the St Vincent’s Hospital Institu- tional Human Research Ethics Committee as a clinical quality review. Data were collected on the clinical reasons for the study, the sus- pected clinical diagnoses, and the TTE views obtainable. Estimations of left and right ventricular (LV and RV) volume and function, includ- ing LV diastolic function were made, along with analysis of aortic, From the Department of Anaesthesia, St Vincent’s Hospital, Mel- bourne, Victoria, Australia.

Dimensions and relevant mea- surements such as ejection fraction, aortic valve velocity/gradient, tricuspid valve regurgitant velocity, and estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) were recorded. Data then were obtained on how the focused TTE impacted patient management decisions, such as changes in anesthesia technique, TEE and invasive monitoring, ﬂuids and vasoactive drugs, cancellation, and referral for formal cardiology- based TTE. A structured data form was used for collection of these data, which formed part of the clinical report of this investigation (Appendix 1). All studies were performed or supervised by experienced cardiac anesthesiologists with extensive TEE experience and qualiﬁcations and additional training in TTE. A schedule was developed with 5 different anesthesiologists rostered for TTE duties when required. Patients primarily were undergoing noncardiac surgery because all patients in the author’s institution undergoing cardiac surgery have intraoperative TEE and have had a preoperative formal TTE. Elective surgery patients are preadmitted at the author’s center by surgical residents of the treating unit in a preadmission clinic. Anes- thesiologists are available for consultation for patients with multiple medical comorbidities or planned complex surgery, but they do not see patients before admission unless speciﬁcally requested to do so. As a result, many patients are seen by the anesthesia team on the morning of surgery, and this is the anesthesiologist or anesthesia resident perform- ing the case. The clinicians are unable to reliably get a formal TTE by the echocardiography laboratory on the same day of surgery. Studies were performed on 3 different machines depending on avail- ability: the semiportable Acuson Cypress (Siemens Healthcare, Moun- tain View, CA), the Vivid I (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), and the iE33 (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA). Patients were referred for a focused TTE whenever an anesthesiol- ogist in charge of the case deemed it necessary to evaluate the patient across the entire spectrum of the perioperative period. This included the anesthesia room, the operating room (OR), and the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Appropriate clinical conditions for a focused cardiovascular ultra- sound (FoCUS) included but were not limited to (1) hemodynamic instability, (2) suspected valvular disease/murmur on physical exami- nation, (3) ventricular function assessment, (4) dyspnea/hypoxemia, (5) poor functional capacity (limited exercise tolerance and difﬁculty per- forming activities of daily living), and (6) any other situation in which a focused TTE was deemed to be useful for the patient’s perioperative care. The anesthesiologist in charge of the case also indicated the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical evaluation of the patient and all usual perioperative monitoring. This included (1) aortic valve disease, (2) mitral valve disease, (3) LV/RV dysfunction, (4) hypovolemia, (5) other valvular disease, (6) pulmonary hypertension, and (7) other diagnoses such as pericardial effusion/tamponade. The TTE views attempted and obtainable also were recorded and were at the discretion of the anesthesiologist echocardiographer depending on the indication for the study and physical characteris- tics of the patient. Patients who had a formal TTE performed after referral from the anesthesia service also were evaluated to assess the accuracy of a FoCUS compared with formal cardiology TTE. This referral was at the discretion of the anesthesiologist echocardiogra- pher in consultation with the primary anesthesiologist and treating surgical unit. RESULTS During the 1-year study period, the anesthesia department was involved in approximately 10,000 cases, of which 50 patients underwent a FoCUS in the perioperative period. Im- ages that were adequate to answer the clinical question of relevance were obtained in 49 of 50 patients, with just 1 patient having such poor image quality that interpretation was impos- sible. This patient was morbidly obese and had suspected anaphylaxis after induction with cardiovascular collapse, hy- poxemia requiring endotracheal intubation, and positive end- expiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O to maintain oxygenation. TEE performed in the same patient also had suboptimal image quality. There were 30 males (60%) and 20 females (40%). The average age of the patients was 65 with a range from 16 to 96 years of age. FoCUS was performed across a wide variety of surgical specialties (Table 1). Most FoCUS studies were per- formed preoperatively in the anesthesia room (Table 2). The predominant clinical indication for a FoCUS was sus- pected valvular disease, determined after auscultation of a murmur on preoperative evaluation by the primary anesthesi- ologist or anesthesia resident involved with the case. Hemody- namic instability and evaluation of ventricular function also were prominent (Table 3). A previously unknown or undifferentiated ejection systolic murmur (ESM) was the most common reason for a FoCUS, with most of these patients having at least some degree of aortic stenosis (AS) (Table 4). The severity of AS was deﬁned by criteria outlined by Bonow et al12 (Table 5). Patients with hemodynamic instability were predominantly those with unex- plained cardiovascular collapse at induction or postoperative Table 1.

AS and poor LV function were the most common diagnostic ﬁndings on TTE (Table 7). The FoCUS resulted in signiﬁcant changes in patient manage- ment decisions in 42 (84%) cases (Table 8). The most common change in management were decisions related to invasive moni- toring requirements. All patients with moderate or severe AS had a preinduction intra-arterial catheter inserted. Patients with mild AS or nonstenotic valvular disease proceeded to the OR without invasive monitoring when the attending anesthesiologist had de- clared he/she would consider intra-arterial pressure monitoring if the patient had signiﬁcant AS (Fig 1). Three of these patients with severe AS had their cases cancelled, and their surgical management changed to less in- vasive, conservative strategies. One was an elderly man sched- uled for transurethral resection of a bladder tumor that was essentially asymptomatic and managed conservatively with ﬂexible cystoscopy under local anesthesia (Fig 1). Another was an elderly woman scheduled for shockwave lithotripsy of a now asymptomatic ureteric stone that was managed conserva- tively and left in situ. Both were considered to be poor surgical candidates for aortic valve replacement. The ﬁnal case was a woman with non–life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding scheduled for a double balloon enteroscopy; the bleeding re- solved spontaneously. She is currently being assessed for pos- sible aortic valve replacement. Almost a third of patients subsequently had a formal cardi- ology-based TTE after their FoCUS. This was to conﬁrm preliminary ﬁndings, an initial appropriate pathway for further follow-up, and possible surgical intervention or alterations in medical therapy. This included all patients with moderate-to- severe AS, a patient with severe AR, a patient with severe MR, a patient with severe LV dysfunction and single patients with unusual ﬁndings such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmo- nary stenosis in a patient with known congenital heart disease, and a patient with a moderate-size atrial septal defect. In 14 of these 16 patients, the formal TTE conﬁrmed the major prelim- inary ﬁndings of the FoCUS study. However, in 2 of these patients, signiﬁcant pulmonary hypertension was not appreci- ated during the FoCUS study. Many patients had changes in their ﬂuid management or the institution of vasoactive drugs based on FoCUS ﬁndings. Four patients had signiﬁcant changes to their anesthesia technique, including 2 having induction with benzodiazepines and opiates in patients with severe AS and another with pulmonary steno- sis; all of these patients presented with perianal disease. Two procedures were performed purely under local anesthesia, in- cluding 1 patient with severe AS and scheduled for carpal tunnel release. Another patient underwent pigtail drainage of a large malignant pericardial effusion with right ventricular com- pression. Two patients were monitored in an ICU setting based on previously unknown severe cardiac pathology. All ulti- mately had uneventful perioperative courses. In 8 (16%) of the patients, the FoCUS resulted in no change in patient management. One patient returned to the operating room for a subxiphoid window and evacuation of pericardial blood after tamponade in the PACU after pacemaker insertion (Fig 2). DISCUSSION This study was designed to assess the feasibility and impact of a focused TTE in the perioperative period by anesthesiolo- gists. Eighty-four percent of the patients had some change in their management as a direct result of information obtained from the FoCUS study. Previous data in ICU populations have supported the concept of a limited TTE and its ability to provide additional informa- tion not obtainable with standard clinical examination.13 This can be performed in around 10 minutes.13 Data in the echocar- diography literature have also supported the concept of focused TTE, which can be performed in some cases in 10% to 15% of the usual time of a formal TTE.14 The ESM was by far the most common reason for a focused TTE in the present study, and multiple publications have high- lighted the limitations of the physical examination in detecting patients with severe AS.8,15,16 This is consistent with previous data showing that almost 50% of unselected elderly patients over 62 Table 5.

Echocardiographic data predict postoperative cardiac com- plications better than models based on clinical variables, with LV systolic dysfunction, LV hypertrophy, MR, and AS all associated with major cardiac events.20 One of the major concerns with the concept of a focused TTE is “missing” or misdiagnosing a major cardiovascular abnormality and its potential effects on perioperative manage- ment. Incidental ﬁndings that are unrelated to the particular question being asked in a focused TTE are common and occur in up to 45% of patients.24 Limited imaging protocols can identify more than 85% of these ﬁndings compared with formal TTE, supporting its use in select circumstances.24,25 In the present series, 2 cases of pulmonary hypertension were not diagnosed. Pulmonary hypertension is a signiﬁcant risk factor for patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, with a 7% mortal- ity rate and a 42% incidence of major morbidity.26 The esti- mation of RVSP is relatively straightforward on TTE by ex- amining the peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet. However, in a limited focused TTE, it is possible to overlook or not measure the RVSP if other gross signs of pulmonary hypertension such as a dilated right ventricle, RV hypertrophy, and paradoxic septal motion are absent. Similarly, other mea- sured variables and ﬁndings may be overlooked if the study is too focused on one area. One of the limitations of the present study is that it was performed at a university academic center, where the pread- mission clinic is run by surgeons and anesthesiologists are available for consultation but do not see every patient coming through the clinic. Centers that have a preadmission clinic run Fig 2. An apical 4-chamber view of a woman with hypotension in the PACU after pacemaker insertion. This patient has compression of her right ventricle with an enlarging pericardial effusion and clot. She returned to the operating room for subxiphoid drainage of 300 mL of blood. Fig 1. An apical 5-chamber view with a continuous-wave Doppler through the aortic valve showing severe AS in a preoper- ative patient scheduled for trans- urethral resection of a bladder tu- mor with an ESM found on the day of surgery. 453FOCUSED CARDIOVASCULAR ULTRASOUND by anesthesia staff, where every patient is seen by an anesthe- siologist or anesthesia resident well before their date of surgery, may have more of an opportunity to detect cardiovascular pathology on initial assessment, allowing time for referral for a formal TTE to evaluate the undifferentiated murmur. In addi- tion, some centers are able to access a formal TTE through the echocardiography laboratory with less than 30 minutes notice, and the value of a preoperative FoCUS may differ if it is possible to get a formal TTE whenever needed. Even in the best centers, the unique nature of anesthesia practice with sudden changes in patient physiology in the OR and the PACU means that 30 minutes is sometimes too long, and having anesthesi- ologists with some TTE capability is invaluable. Exactly how focused a perioperative anesthesia-run TTE should be is unclear and will depend on the speciﬁc indication, patient, and surgical factors. The author recommends that this should include aortic valve gradient or area, an estimate of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (from the RVSP), an assess- ment of the pericardial space, and qualitative assessment of LV function as bare minimum requirements. CONCLUSION Focused cardiovascular ultrasound performed by anesthe- siologists in the perioperative period is feasible, readily obtainable in almost all patients, avoids unnecessary delays or cancellation waiting for formal TTE, and signiﬁcantly alters management in the majority of patients in whom it is indicated.
