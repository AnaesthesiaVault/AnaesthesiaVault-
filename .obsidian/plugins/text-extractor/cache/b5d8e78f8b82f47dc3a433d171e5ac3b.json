This suggests that, if the BTS guidelines are followed, this may lead to a substantial amount of hyperoxaemia! ¢ In ARDS, aim for S,0, 82-88%; balance target S,0, and ventilatory toxicity rather than a specific goal ¢ Maintain the DO, — NOT supranormal, target cardiac output and haemoglobin o But remember that in non-hypoxaemia patients, increasing the p,0, does not increase the DO, ¢ Minimise oxygen consumption (VO,) with sedation, cooling and avoiding patient-ventilator dyssynchrony * Balance the risk of hypoxaemia against the potential harm of hyperoxaemia and hyperoxia ¢ The adage that hyperoxaemia was acceptable provide that at FiO,was low is probably not correct! * The practice of liberal oxygen and supernormal p,0, should be revised * Hypoxaemic patients should be regularly reassessed to limit the risk of hyperoxaemia since hyperoxaemia may be associated with worse outcomes * Optimal targets have not yet been established — recommendations are emerging to maintain $,0, 95- 97% o Thereis no need for oxygen if p,0, >100mmHg (13.3kPa) or 5,0, >97% * Time of duration of hyperoxaemia is harmful — beware of p,0, during prolonged anaesthesia * There is no place for hypobaric hyperoxaemia, even short durations of hyperoxaemia may be detrimental ¢ Personalised medicine ~ some patients may benefit from higher oxygen levels... .just not sure who, yet! ® Please note —there is no debate that hypoxaemic patients should receive supplemental oxygen, but caution should be taken to avoid overshoot into hyperoxaemia at all costs. Patients who are normoxaemic do not need supplemental oxveen.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
