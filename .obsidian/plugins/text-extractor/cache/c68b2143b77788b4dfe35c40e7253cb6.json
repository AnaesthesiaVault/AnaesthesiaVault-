Laparoscopy should be performed before 32 weeks gestation to avoid the risk of preterm labour and allow adequate surgical access (second trimester if possible) 2. Abdominal access should be open and trochars placed away from the uterus 3. Mechanical ventilation should be adjusted to maintain physiologic maternal alkalosis 4. Prophylactic tocolytics are unnecessary, but should be available to manage preterm labour 5. The foetus can be adequately monitored via transvaginal ultrasound. 6. Body positioning should avoid inferior vena cava compression. 7. Abdominal insufflation pressure should be kept as low as possible in pregnant patients.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
