Adequate equipment and skill available to perform the procedure. Have an airway plan A, B, C. Be patient! A properly conducted AFOI takes fime. Counsel and consent patient. Psychological preparation is essential. As the patient arrives in the induction room, insert IVI and administer glycopyrollate 3-4ug/kg Prepare 4% lignocaine and calculate the maximum dose for the patient (9mg/kg). Identify most patent nasal passage. Administer oxymetazoline vasoconstricting nose drops to both nostiils. Nebulise 4 ml 4% lignocaine with 0.5-1mg 1:1000 adrenalin. On completion of nebulised lignocaine, use remicaine jelly on a pus swab or lignocaine soaked pledgets (with 1:200000 adrenalin) into nasal cavity and posterior nasal space. Allow patient to gargle with 1-2mi 4% lignocaine i possible. Consider transtracheal injection. Take patient into operating theatre and apply standard monitoring. Have drugs for GA drawn up Operating table as low as possible. Position patient semi sitting or supine with anaesthetist in front of or behind patient, depending on operator preference/patient convenience. Facing patient inverts FOI view. Check scope, orientation, black notch at 12 o'clock, clear focus on written object, working suction, second wall suction with yankauer for oropharynx if needed. Prepare epidural catheter for SAYGO. Decide on sedative: Remifentanil 1-3ng/mi TCI or dexmedetomidine 1uglkg over 10 minutes then 0.3-0.7ug/kg/hr. Second sedationist present. (Supplemental oxygen if indicated via nasal prongs or face mask.) Mount the tracheal tube on the scope for the nasal route or within the oral airway for the oral route. Use a 6-6.5mm warmed reinforced ETT with adequate lubrication between the scope and ETT and around tiplcuff of ETT for passage through the nose. (Alternatively use ETT from intubating LMA with tapered tip to avoid hold up at arytenoids). Secure ETT to top of scope","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
