Correct inadequate Cardiac Output and Mean Arterial Pressure o Shock = inadequate oxygen delivery to organs relative their need resulting in organ damage « DO to the entire body = Cardiac Output * Oxygen Content of blood = Need adequate cardiac output to get blood flow to organs : « Cardiac Index of >2L/min/m” is recommended o (Cl = body surface area-standardized Cardiac Output) = Organs such as brain and kidneys need blood at reasonable pressure « Usual target Mean Arterial Pressure is 65mmHg « Ifintra-compartment pressure elevated, elevate target MAP to achieve Perfusion Pressure of 50-60mmHg o MAPtarget = IntraCompartment Pressure + Perfusion Pressure o Eg: head injury with ICP assumed to be 15-20 mmHg, and Cerebral Perfusion Pressure of 60mmHg desired: MAP target = 75-80mmHg « Identify MECHANISMS of shock : several typically exist in ICU patients with sepsis or after injury/surgery = Tiy to define in your mind which of these mechanisms currently exist, and tailor the package of cardiovascular resuscitation to try to address these mechanisms in the ‘most balanced way possible o Fluid deficit? Is there an absolute intravascular fluid deficit due to loss of fuid from the vessels? = “Hypovolaemic shock” = Will require rapid fluid administration to replenish intravascular volume o Pump failure? Is there inadequate cardiac function due to myocardial damage or due to circulating inflammation-induced myocardial depressant factors? + “Cardiogenic shock “ = May require reduction of excessive afterload or preload = May require an INOTROPE o Pipes failure? Is there abnormal arteriodilation and/or venodilation due to altered sympathetic tone or due to inflammation-induced vasodilator substances? « “Distributive shock” « Maldistribution of blood into abnormally dilated venous beds leads to a relative intravascular fluid deficit = Appropriate therapy may be a VASOPRESSOR to limit pooling of blood in venous system (venoconstriction), = AVASOPRESSOR may also be necessary to achieve appropriate arterioconstriction to ensure Mean Arterial Pressure is adequate for pressure-sensitive organs such as the brain and kidneys (MAP = Cardiac Output * Systemic Vascular Resistance), but excess arterioconstriction must be avoided as this will lead to excess cardiac afterload which may significantly reduce Cardiac Output.. use a cardiac output ‘monitor to guide this balance. o Obstruction to blood flow? « “Obstructive shock” = From within vessels : pulmonary thromboembolism... « Elevate cardiac output and blood pressure multimodally in an attempt to get flow past the obstruction, anticoagulate, investigate options to lyse clot","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
