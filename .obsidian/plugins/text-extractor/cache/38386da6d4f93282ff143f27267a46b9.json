May need a drying agent before operation, for example, glycopyrrolate. Antimuscarinic (e.g. neostigmine) drugs increase the viscosity of saliva, thus further impairing swallowing — Increased prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux — Postoperative ileus or delayed gastric emptying may result in reduced absorption of enteral anti-parkinsonian drugs Urological — Increased risk of postoperative urinary tract infection","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
