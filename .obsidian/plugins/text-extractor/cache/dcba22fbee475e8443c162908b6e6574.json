Echocardiogra- phy shows promise for evolving applications in the peri-operative assessment and therapeutic management of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, whether it be elective or emergency. Although evidence is limited with regard to signiﬁcant impact on outcomes from anaesthesia and surgery, there is little doubt about the validity and power of two-dimensional real-time viewing of cardiac anatomy and function. Echocardiography can be used to assist in decision-making along the entire peri-operative pathway, and is increasingly delivered by the previously referring physicians. The discussion around more widespread incorporation of cardiac ultrasound into anaesthetic practice must take into account competency, training and governance. Failure to do so adequately may mean that the use of echocardiography is poorly applied and costly. ................................................................................................................................................................. Correspondence to: R. L. Barber Email: russellbarber78@googlemail.com Accepted: 17 February 2014 Introduction There is a tipping point at which the uptake of a highly functional technology, such as the mobile phone, can be observed to behave almost like the spread of an epi- demic [1]. Arguably, the tipping point for echocardiog- raphy was reached well over a decade ago in cardiac anaesthesia and emergency medicine [2–4] and within the last decade in critical care [5, 6]. This pattern of uptake has also occurred with ultrasound for nerve blocks and vascular access in anaesthesia [7–10]. Echo- cardiography, or cardiac ultrasound, allows the clinician to view heart valves, cardiac chambers, the pericardium and major blood vessels, and also to observe the blood ﬂow within these structures. Historically, this was limited to patients who were safely able to reach the echocardiography department [11]. With the develop- ment of compact, portable, high-quality platforms, echocardiography can now be readily performed wher- ever the patient is located. Clinical demand is now the only driver for an echocardiographic examination rather than the geography of the hospital, and, as referred to above, this clinical demand has continued to expand. Echocardiography is a complex technical skill and the limiting factor in the uptake of echocardiography in these settings is the availability of trained operators. Much has been written about this clinical demand and there are a variety of initiatives in different healthcare systems to supply it. As anaesthetists demand more widespread use of echocardiography within their practice [12], it is 764 © 2014 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland Anaesthesia 2014, 69, 764–776 doi:10.1111/anae.12663 pertinent to stand back and evaluate the supporting evidence and search for insight into how this may be achieved safely and efﬁciently. Methods In this review, we have searched PubMed and Embase using the terms echocardiography, ultrasound, anaes- thesia, anesthesiology, anaesthetist and anesthesiologist. We have also searched the websites of professional bodies related to echocardiography and anaesthetic practice. We have ﬁltered the results to focus particu- larly on echocardiography in non-cardiac anaesthesia practice, although we have included other publica- tions from related areas of practice, where relevant. We present a narrative review highlighting the best of the available supporting evidence and professional recommendations. Pre-operative assessment and the undifferentiated murmur Valvular heart disease is an independent risk factor for peri-operative mortality and morbidity [13]. However, the clinical methods by which murmurs are detected and classiﬁed as normal or abnormal can be sur- rounded by difﬁculties. Although pre-operative ques- tioning may raise the suspicion of valvular pathology, the lack of symptoms may be falsely reassuring. Early features of symptomatic valvular disease may be non- speciﬁc and difﬁcult to separate from co-existent respi- ratory disease, and some patients may be unaware of a gradual decline in their exercise tolerance. Heart mur- murs are commonly detected by anaesthetists during pre-operative assessment, yet the sensitivity of auscul- tation in this context is unknown [14]. Senior cardiol- ogists fail to detect 10–20% of murmurs, and no physical examination ﬁnding has been identiﬁed that has both a high sensitivity and a high speciﬁcity for the diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis in asymptomatic subjects [15]. It is recommended that echocardiogra- phy be performed in patients with known or suspected valvular heart disease to assess its severity and conse- quences [16]. It comes as little surprise that practice differs between anaesthetists, mostly when it comes to striking a balance between thorough investigation and the need for expedient surgery. A dilemma is commonly encountered for patients with hip fractures, in whom the prevalence of moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis may be as high as 8% [17] and a delay in surgery is asso- ciated with an increase in morbidity and mortality [18, 19]. A national postal survey highlighted this dilemma: 20% of respondents would insist on an echocardiogram when confronted with a previously undiagnosed heart murmur; 54% would request an echocardiogram only in the presence of suspicious signs or symptoms; and 26% would proceed with hip surgery in the absence of an echocardiogram [20]. Patients who have echocardiography are more likely to experience a delay in surgery, although this delay may be determined by their overall medical com- plexity [21]. The institution of a dedicated echocardi- ography service, among other service changes, can reduce the mean time for transthoracic echocardiogra- phy (TTE) and surgery [17]. This is in line with national recommendations that the availability of pre- operative TTE should be prioritised [22]. The authors claimed that the service improved the process of informed consent and increased clinicians’ vigilance, but a major drawback was that the service depended on senior sonographers who were unavailable at week- ends. Many hospitals are, in reality, unable to deliver even a weekday service [23, 24]. A focused TTE deliv- ered by the anaesthetist can relieve pressures on echo- cardiography departments without introducing a delay before surgery [25, 26]. Loxdale et al. undertook TTE in all patients with hip fracture; in contrast, Canty et al. performed a focused TTE examination, designed to take < 10 min only on patients more than 65 years old [17]. This more practical and achievable concept showed a lower 30-day and 12-month mortality in the 64 patients who underwent TTE in comparison with the control group [26]. This proof-of-concept study lacked power, but it showed that anaesthetic-delivered TTE is feasible and an area of promise for future research. Pre-operative assessment and ventricular function Major adverse cardiac events are a leading cause of mor- bidity and mortality following major surgery [27–29]. Pre-operative risk stratiﬁcation using clinical cardiovas- cular risk indices are utilised in an attempt to study and © 2014 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland 765 Barber and Fletcher | Impact of echocardiography Anaesthesia 2014, 69, 764–776 improve these outcomes [30–32]. Resting pre-operative TTE is one non-invasive test that is commonly requested to provide additional prognostic information. It is as yet equivocal whether adding echocardiography values to models of risk prediction improves their pre- dictive strength. This may be either because resting TTE cannot reliably detect coronary artery disease and inducible ischaemia, or because there are limited thera- peutic options for poor systolic function. Studies have advanced conﬂicting views, and there are no rando- mised controlled trials evaluating the effect of pre- operative echocardiography on postoperative outcomes [33, 34]. It is important to note that left ventricular dysfunction is not purely conﬁned to systolic function. Half of patients with congestive cardiac failure have normal systolic function [35], and the signiﬁcance of diastolic dysfunction has only recently come to light. Diastolic dysfunction is an independent predictor of adverse outcome after major vascular surgery and can be assessed using TTE [36]. The incorporation of pulse wave and tissue Doppler into modern bedside ultra- sound platforms raises the possibility of its inclusion into pre-operative TTE protocols. It is similarly important to appreciate that the model of cardiac function as a single chamber pump is an oversimpliﬁcation. The right ventricle has, until recently, received less attention than the left. There are few studies that have speciﬁcally examined the risk associated with right ventricular failure and non-car- diac surgery. Right ventricular dysfunction in cardiac surgery signiﬁcantly increases the resulting morbidity and mortality. Severe pulmonary hypertension is asso- ciated with a 7% mortality rate in non-cardiac surgery in which right ventricular failure was a contributing cause of death [37]. Recognition of the condition and directed peri-operative treatment are essential in the management of these patients. Echocardiography is the only practical investigation available for conﬁrmation of the diagnosis of right ventricular failure, and is accurate for the evaluation of pulmonary hypertension [38, 39]. Current evidence-based consensus recommenda- tions do not agree on the use of resting echocardiogra- phy for left ventricular assessment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery (level C evidence and IIa recommendation) [16, 40], yet it is the most frequently requested specialised test before non-cardiac surgery. This places a signiﬁcant burden on busy outpatient echocardiography clinics and introduces a delay to the ﬂow of patients along the surgical pathway. This pro- vides context for the interest in anaesthetist-delivered echocardiography. Echocardiography is surely a power- ful tool when in the hands of the person posing the clinical question, who is then in the position of trans- lating the results of the scan into a peri-operative plan. In the emergency setting, when access to echocar- diography may be time-limited, clinical assessment of cardiac disease may be unreliable. Echocardiography has been shown to change the cardiac diagnosis in as many as 67% of patients [41]. Three of the four patients with a clinical diagnosis of cardiac failure made by the anaesthetist were revealed to be incorrect. Two of these patients were found to be hypovolaemic on TTE and administration of ﬂuid boluses was required. Similarly, three of the ﬁve patients assessed as hypovolaemic by the anaesthetist had cardiac fail- ure, as was one patient who was diagnosed with nor- mal cardiac function. Focused TTE has been shown to enhance conﬁdence in decision-making with regard to cardiovascular pathology in the emergency department, and it seems plausible to suggest that a similar effect may be seen in peri-operative practice [4]. Although there is doubt regarding the validity of left ventricular assessment with resting TTE to reduce individual mor- tality and morbidity, a test that improves diagnostic accuracy and clinical management may result in improved clinical outcomes, and further work is needed to capture potential beneﬁts. Impact on pre-operative management Transthoracic echocardiography can be used anytime in the period preceding surgery, from the pre-assess- ment clinic to the anaesthetic room, and it has been shown to inﬂuence anaesthetic management [25, 42]. A change in management occurred in 54% of unse- lected patients, but when applied to a selected group with suspected cardiac disease, this increased to 61% [43]. This compares favourably with the critical care environment, where TTE is more established [44]. Over- all, Canty et al. found that there was an escalation in management in 20–33% of patients, and it was scaled down in 8–34% [41–43]. On further examination, a 766 © 2014 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland Anaesthesia 2014, 69, 764–776 Barber and Fletcher | Impact of echocardiography signiﬁcant proportion of this impact related to the requirement for vasopressors or intra-operative inva- sive monitoring. It is possible to interpret this as merely opinion, but it may indeed represent a vigilant and proactive approach to the prevention of acute car- diovascular decompensation. Cowie et al. found that pre-operative TTE in the operating or anaesthetic room avoided an adverse incident on six occasions (7% of all scans) [25]. Planned non-essential surgery was cancelled or delayed following the diagnosis of hitherto unrecognised severe valvular pathology or pulmonary hypertension. Similarly, on two occasions in an audit of 39 patients, TTE performed in the anaesthetic room revealed cardiac disease of such severity that a conservative management plan was instigated as an alternative to surgery [42]. Effective pre-operative assessment also has a signiﬁcant impact on hospital efﬁciency and postoperative resource allo- cation. With ever increasing demand for critical care beds, there are clinical and economic pressures to use this limited resource as efﬁciently as possible [44–47]. Pre-operative bed requests may be based on inaccurate information, and result in inappropriate prioritisation or delay in critical care bed allocation. Greater accu- racy of pre-operative assessment using TTE can reduce postoperative referral to high-dependency areas, reduce the surgical cancellation rate and also reduce referral rates to allied specialities such as cardiology [42] (Table 1). Intra-operative haemodynamic monitoring The ability of multiplane transoesophageal echocardi- ography (TOE) to inﬂuence anaesthetic and surgical decision making in cardiac surgery [52] has made rou- tine TOE not only a clinically beneﬁcial modality but also a cost-effective one [53–59]. The widespread use of TOE in non-cardiac surgery remains controversial. However, there are speciﬁc circumstances where the impact of TOE is increasingly recognised, such as hae- modynamic failure and optimisation. Transoesophageal echocardiography can alter intra-operative anaesthetic care for a wide range of patients, including minor abdominal to major vascular procedures, and Suriani et al. showed that in 15% of cases, TOE may have a major impact [48]. Impact studies in the context of haemodynamically unstable patients yield much more impressive results: therapy was altered in 60% of patients with life-threatening unexplained intra-opera- tive hypoxia or hypotension in another study [49]. During 22 intra-operative cardiac arrests, TOE estab- lished the primary aetiology in 19. This included nine patients with thromboembolic events and two with cardiac tamponade. This gave the clinicians the conﬁ- dence to proceed rapidly beyond advanced cardiac life support protocols to implement deﬁnitive therapy, including pulmonary embolectomy, ventricular thromb- ectomy, pericardotomy and mechanical support by intra-aortic balloon pump [60]. Assessment of preload and myocardial contractility is an essential accompani- ment to the successful modern management of the high- risk surgical patient. Echocardiography can accurately predict ﬂuid responsiveness and enable informed changes in vasoactive drugs [51, 61–65]. Unlike alterna- tive ﬂow-based monitors that display a numerical value, echocardiography can display real-time changes in val- vular function or the development of ventricular wall motion abnormality. Segmental wall motion abnormali- ties are alarmingly common, seen in 20–32% of patients undergoing surgery, and there is a clear association with coronary ischaemia and cardiac events [66]. Prompt detection and treatment can result in the resolution of myocardial ischaemia, and TOE has been demonstrated to be effective when used in this manner [51]. Transo- esophageal echocardiography is twice as sensitive to left ventricular wall motion abnormalities when compared with ECG monitoring, although clinical and enzyme correlation with intra-operative ﬁndings is currently lacking [67]. A new miniaturised monoplane disposable TOE probe (Imacor Inc, New York, NY, USA) has been recently trialled in critical care and cardiac surgery [68– 70]. Whereas it is too early in the development of this technology to recommend its use in non-cardiac surgery, the potential utility and ease of use for the non-expert echocardiographer warrant investigation for non-cardiac surgical intra-operative use. Emergency and trauma care There is an increasing body of evidence that advocates the role of echocardiography in the emergency depart- ment and in the management of trauma patients [71–78].

Jones et al. used TTE in the assessment of patients with non-traumatic hypotension and shock [71, 78]. They concluded that early echocardiography increased the likelihood of detecting the correct diagnosis for the cause of hypo- tension from 50% to 80%, and echocardiographic detection of hyperdynamic left ventricular function had a high speciﬁcity (93%) for septic shock [71, 78]. Other investigators have successfully used echocardiog- raphy to assess cardiac pathology such as chest pain, cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion in the emergency department [73, 74, 79]. Anaesthetists are an essential part of hospital resuscitation and trauma teams. The role of the anaesthetist in a resuscitation and/or major trauma scenario may extend beyond the more conven- tional requisite of airway management to provision of advanced circulatory support such as establishing inva- sive monitoring and commencing vasopressors and/or inotropes, if required. Echocardiography thus merits a place in resuscitation protocols and the advanced cir- culatory management of blunt or penetrating traumatic injury, and could be a vital tool in the decision-making process. It is worth mentioning pleural ultrasound in this context. Pneumothorax occurring intra-operatively is the stuff of anaesthetic nightmares. Radiographic diagnosis is rarely possible, yet an incorrect clinical diagnosis has very serious implications for the physi- cian and patient. A simple ultrasound technique using a linear array ultrasound probe attached to a basic ultrasound machine is a sensitive test to assist in this difﬁcult task [80, 81] and should always be considered. Neuroanaesthesia Operating on patients in the sitting position can improve surgical conditions, by allowing access to deeper structures without excessive cerebellar retrac- tion, as well as aiding the passive drainage of cerebro- spinal ﬂuid and blood with gravity, thereby providing a clearer surgical ﬁeld. However, one of the most seri- ous drawbacks and fundamental reasons for the dimin- ishing use of the sitting position during neurosurgery is the occurrence of venous air embolism [82]. This can complicate as many as 76% of neurosurgical pro- cedures [83], and although it alone can be fatal, when accompanied by the presence of a patent foramen ovale, it can lead to paroxysmal air embolism and severe neurological sequelae. The incidence of asymp- tomatic probe-patent foramen ovale may be as high as 27% of the population as a whole [84]. Some authors Table 1 (continued) Methodology Impact Comments Schulmeyer et al.

Patients scheduled to undergo neurosurgery in the upright position should have contrast echocardiography pre-operatively or an intra-operative contrast TOE fol- lowing induction of anaesthesia, to dictate whether the surgery is performed with the patient sitting or supine [86]. Transoesophageal echocardiography is the most sensitive intra-operative monitor to detect air in the right atrium and paradoxical left atrial air [87, 88]. It can also reﬁne the ﬁnal positioning of a central venous catheter at the junction of the right atrium and the superior vena cava to allow for the aspiration of air in case of air embolism [89]. Most episodes of venous air embolism are preventable, and the use of TOE may lead to the resurgence of this surgical technique before the skills are lost to the new generation of surgeons. Vascular anaesthesia The use of intra-operative TOE to monitor cardiac function has been previously discussed. In addition, the high-resolution images of the aorta acquired by TOE make it an attractive and complementary modal- ity for endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta. Transoesophageal echocardiography has proven partic- ularly valuable for selecting the landing site for the proximal stent by illustrating areas of atheroma or calciﬁcation that would otherwise not be detected by angiography and could interfere with stent adhesion. In one case series, the addition of this information led to a change in the landing site in a third of patients [90]. Transoesophageal echocardiography can indicate accidental placement of the guidewire into the false lumen, allowing for immediate repositioning, and it is also able to detect the position of the guidewire tip in relation to the aortic valve, preventing arrhythmia or damage to the delicate valve cusps. After stent deploy- ment, TOE can detect the presence of endoleaks. The sensitivity of TOE in detecting small amounts of ﬂow into the aneurysmal sac makes it ideal and in many instances it has surpassed angiography [91]. In one case series, angiography failed to detect six of the eight endoleaks found by TOE [92]. However, when endole- aks are observed by TOE and not by angiography, it creates a difﬁcult dilemma. Should immediate remedial action be undertaken in the operating room or should careful follow-up, looking for spontaneous closure with CT imaging, occur in the outpatient setting [91]? In the absence of research, the interpretation of these conﬂicting ﬁndings has relied on clinical judgement and experience. Intensive care Much has already been written about the utility and uptake of echocardiography into intensive care practice, and readers are referred elsewhere for a more detailed treatment of the evidence round this topic [93–95]. However, as many anaesthetists are also employed in critical care, this article would be incomplete without an examination of some of the main themes. Patients requiring intensive care commonly exhibit disordered and unstable physiology, which is continu- ously being manipulated by interventions such as ﬂuid infusion and vasoactive drug administration. Heart– lung interactions are complex, and even small changes in positive pressure ventilation can produce signiﬁcant haemodynamic effects, impacting on the performance of both ventricles. The response to an intervention is often unclear, and this is of particular concern as unti- mely [96], overzealous [97–99] or restrained [100] therapy can be detrimental to outcome. Current evi- dence suggests that central venous pressure monitoring is no better than ‘ﬂipping a coin’ [101], and with the abandonment of right heart catheterisation in general critical care [102, 103], it is inevitable that critical care physicians are turning to echocardiography for answers. Echocardiography has been shown to alter the manage- ment of critically ill patients signiﬁcantly [44, 104, 105], and it is the investigation of choice in cardiac ICU [106]; there is also increasing international recognition of its various applications [107, 108]. The ﬂuid responsiveness of a particular patient’s circulation is a commonly encountered clinical dilemma. Echocardiography can readily identify the causes of shock [71, 109] and there are a number of well-validated echocardiography applications to predict ﬂuid responsiveness [62–64]. Echocardiography can also predict the response to ﬂuid in situations when other methods are not validated, for example, during spontaneous breathing as opposed to mechanical venti- lation [110]. For those deemed unresponsive to ﬂuids, 770 © 2014 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland Anaesthesia 2014, 69, 764–776 Barber and Fletcher | Impact of echocardiography it can guide pharmacological [111] and mechanical [112] support of the cardiovascular system. In cases of persistent shock, echocardiography is the only bedside test that can identify dynamic left ventricular outﬂow tract obstruction, right ventricular failure or complications of myocardial infarction such as papillary muscle rupture or ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hyper- tension are common but often underdiagnosed condi- tions in critical care. They may be encountered in 25% of patients with acute lung injury [113], and right ven- tricular dysfunction can be seen in up to 31% of septic patients [114]. The use of echocardiography is moving beyond a limited focused examination and towards uncovering some of the less understood causes of hypoxaemia and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, such as patent foramen ovale and diastolic dysfunction [115]. As the enthusiasm for echocardiography in the ICU gathers pace and new applications are studied, there will undoubtedly be variation in physicians’ experience and competence. There is a risk that the boundaries between focused and advanced imaging become blurred. To ensure patient safety, it is imperative that the competence of the operator is deﬁned and the endpoints for which the modality is being utilised are clearly laid out. Obstetric anaesthesia Cardiac disease is the leading cause of maternal death in developed countries, with an increasing incidence of obstetric patients with congenital heart disease, coro- nary artery disease, heart transplantation and cardio- myopathies presenting for peripartum care [116]. Symptoms such as dyspnoea are common and can lead to diagnostic dilemmas in the pregnant population, and the challenges of managing these complex patients for anaesthetic and surgical interventions are consider- able. Echocardiography is recommended as a ﬁrst-line investigation in the diagnosis and management in severe chest pain and shortness of breath [116]. Den- nis and Stenson describe the assessment of a case of undifferentiated shock within 6 h of caesarean section for antepartum haemorrhage – massive pulmonary embolism and ongoing hypovolaemia were excluded and diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy was made, enabling the commencement of prompt and appropriate medical therapy [117]. There is a similar report of the diagnosis of an unsuspected acute aortic dissection by an anaesthetic echocardiographer performing a focused scan, enabling prompt and life- saving referral for surgical repair of the aorta [118]. While these case reports do not provide hard evidence of broader beneﬁt to obstetric patients, the beneﬁtto these individual critically ill patients was inestimable. Haemodynamically unstable obstetric patients consti- tute a particularly difﬁcult study group. The predomi- nance of regional anaesthesia in the obstetric setting favours TTE over other invasive modalities, as it is well tolerated by the mothers and the feasibility of intra-operative TTE has been demonstrated [119]. The left lateral position for the avoidance of caval compres- sion is also conducive to the attainment of good acoustic windows and a recent study was able demonstrate good-quality systolic, diastolic and structural informa- tion in 100% of the 80 women enrolled [120]. This study also demonstrated that echocardiography is rede- ﬁning how we think about hypertension in pre- eclampsia. Some pregnant women would appear to have a high cardiac output with mild elevations in sys- temic vascular resistance [120], while others have a low cardiac output and a high systemic vascular resis- tance [121]. Although opinions that it may be a heter- ogenous condition remain polarised, there is agreement that diastolic dysfunction and pericardial effusions are more common in women with untreated pre-eclamp- sia. Dennis et al. described two women who were noted to have diastolic compression of the right side of the heart, an early echocardiographic sign associated with cardiac tamponade. Untreated pre-eclamptic women or those who respond poorly to treatment may represent a subset of patients who may beneﬁt from pre-term echocardiography and additional input in the peri-partum period. Clearly, echocardiography during normal deliveries is neither desirable nor cost-effective; however, its use in assessing complicated, unstable or high-risk patients warrants further exploration. Conclusions Echocardiography in non-cardiac surgery and obstetric practice is an emerging technological application. The evidence base for its use is somewhat limited at the © 2014 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland 771 Barber and Fletcher | Impact of echocardiography Anaesthesia 2014, 69, 764–776 moment and is mostly conﬁned to audits, case reports and observational studies produced by a number of pioneers and advocates. A common theme in a num- ber of studies is that the echocardiography examina- tion (both TTE and TOE) is performed by an accredited expert. This will clearly affect the results and make it difﬁcult to extrapolate the conclusions to the current clinical reality where accredited expert anaesthetic echocardiographers are in very limited sup- ply. It also raises the question of manpower and affordability in comparison with cardiology, where echocardiography is delivered by highly trained techni- cians. Interestingly, the same pattern of development can be observed for echocardiography in cardiac sur- gery and critical care, for which there is now plenty of evidence of impact, but little evidence of improved outcomes. There is a large number of anaesthetic stud- ies where a mode of monitoring is introduced or two modes of monitoring are compared. The key to the value of the monitor is how the information thus obtained is interpreted and used to change the patient management. Echocardiography in its more focused applications does not provide simple measures such as cardiac index or stroke volume variability. It is there- fore more difﬁcult to protocolise an intervention such as ﬂuid or inotropes compared with, for example, oesophageal Doppler. The interpretations and inter- ventions based on echocardiography are multiple and do not readily map to a binary decision-making sequence. A paradigmatic shift is required. The true value of echocardiography lies in its greater applicabil- ity and reliability in a wide variety of clinical scenarios and environments. The pulse oximeter and the capno- graph were disruptive technological innovations in anaesthesia that revolutionised practice without a large evidence base. The ﬂipside of this is the complexity and technical skill needed for performance and inter- pretation. Echocardiography as an imaging technology in all its forms is very well validated and used throughout the world – without a great deal of out- come research or economic analysis. We suggest that the barrier to greater use in our ﬁeld is not so much a lack of evidence, rather the problems associated with establishing large-scale training programmes for anaes- thetic specialists, and we shall explore this further in part 2 of our review.
