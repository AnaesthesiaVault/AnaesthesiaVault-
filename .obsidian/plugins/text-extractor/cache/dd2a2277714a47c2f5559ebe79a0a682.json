Continuous renal replacement therapy requires central doubl-lumen veno venous catheter,an exracorporel e and haemofiler, blood pump, and an effluent pump. Depending on the type of continuous renal replacement therapy, dialysate, replacement fluid pumps, or both are required. In con- dmuous veno-venous hacmilzatio, solutes and. plasma water are forced across the semipermeable membrane by high ultrailzation rates (convection). Simultaneously, replacement fluid is infused into the blood with the use of a replacement pump. In continuous veno-venous haemodialysis, solutes and plasma move across the semipermeable membrane into the dialysate compartment of the haemofilter by means of diffusion. In continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration, solutes and plasma water are removed by diffusion, convection, and ultrafiltration.
