Precise control of arterial oxygenation (PCAO). 1. Permissive hypoxaemia can be thought of as a strategy of lung protective. The rationale is that, in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Acute Lung Injury (ALI), the unrealistic attempt to achieve normoxaemia may lead to injurious ventilation strategies (for example: high F,0, and high ventilatory pressures / tidal volumes). There is evidence to suggest that, in this subgroup of patients, permissive hypoxaemia is associated with less volutrauma, barotrauma, biotrauma, oxygen toxicity and adverse effects on right ventricular function. [Think of it as akin to permissive hypercarbia — the recognition that going “balls to the wall” with high respiratory rates, tidal volumes and inspiratory pressures to achieve normal CO, values, is harmful and unnecessary, provided that the pH remains about 7.25; similarly, going all out to achieve normal oxygen levels is also harmful and unrealistic]. The ARDS Network guidelines suggest keeping the p,0; value between 55 and 80mmHg (7.3 and 10.6kPa). 2. PCAO acknowledges that trying to prevent hypoxaemia frequently results in hyperoxaemia, rather than the intended normoxaemia. The aim of PCAQ is to tightly control blood oxygen levels, such as 5.0, 88-92% or p,0, 8-10kPa (60-7SmmHg) to prevent hyperoxaemia. In this lecture, | will focus more on the avoldance of hyperoxaemia, rather than permissive hypoxaemia, If one looks at the clinical scenario of hyperoxaemia, it occurs commonly in medicine, yet it is wholly artificial! Outside of the medical setting, humans (and animals) are never exposed to hyperoxia or hyperoxaemia, whereas hypoxia or hypoxaemia occur commonly in both disease states and at altitude.
