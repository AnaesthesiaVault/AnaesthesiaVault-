Can Resp J 2017; 2834956 (without permission). This U-shaped outcome curve has also been described in a 2017 observational cohort study {Helmerhorst — Crit Care Med 2017) where the lowest mortality was seen with a p,0, between 110-150mmHg (14, 7-20kPa); the mortality sharply increased at p,0, <67mmHg {8.9kPa) and >225mmHg {33.3kPa). A dose-response refationship between supraphysiological p,0; and hospital mortality, ICU mortality and ventitator free days was described. Importantly this study also showed that the probability of death increases linearly when the time spent in mild hyperoxaemia increases (mild hyperoxaemia defined as P,0, 120-200mmHg / 16-26.6kPa). This is a crucial finding: short term mild hyperoxaemia may not be of harm, but cumulative exposure (even Lo mild hyperoxaemia) may have a negative impact on clinical outcome (See Figure 2).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
