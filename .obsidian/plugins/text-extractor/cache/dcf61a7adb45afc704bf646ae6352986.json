{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240214122237.png","text":"The evidence for cutting back There are few studies in the mechanically ventilated critically ill patient looking at conservative oxygen therapy. 2 pilot studies have been published in the past 4 years (Suzuki 2014; Panwar 2016). » The Suzuki study randomised patients to conventional therapy vs. targeting an S,0, of 90-92%. There were no major adverse clinical or physiological effects, and a trend to less non-respiratory organ dysfunction AND a greater reduction in lactate levels in the conservative oxygen therapy group. o The Panwar group targeted an S,0, of 88-92% vs. 296% and found no significant difference in organ dysfunction or ICU or 90-day mortality. However, a pre-specified subgroup analysis in patients with respiratory failure showed a reduction in mortality with a conservative oxygen strategy. The only randomised controlled trial of conservative vs. conventional oxygen therapy in the critically ill was published in 2016 and is known as the Oxygen-ICU trial {Girardis -2016). The investigators only recruited 480 patients out of an intended 660 as the hospital was damaged by an earthquake (yes, really!). The standard practice group received an F,0, of >0.4 with the aims of achieving a p,0, up to 150mmHg (20kPa) AND an 5,0, of 97-100%. If the 5,0, dropped to <95-97%, the clinician could increase the F,0, to reach the intended target value. The results showed that the intervention group had a lower F,0,and p,0,, and that there was a lower mortality in the group who received conservative oxygen therapy [Mortality 11.6% vs. 20.2%; ARR 8.6%; 95%C| 1.7-15; p=0.01; NNT=12]. There was a significant reduction in shock and liver failure in the conservative oxygen group, and a nonsignificant reduction in liver failure (although they acknowledge that larger multicentre RCTs are needed in the light of the unplanned premature termination of this trial). Improved outcomes were seen with a target S,0, of 94-98% and there was a U-shaped relationship between “time- weighted” p,0, (this can be thought of as an average p,0,) with the highest mortaljty seen with an overall average time-weighted p,0, of 2107mmHg / 14.3kPa.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
