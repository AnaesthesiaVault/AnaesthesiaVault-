Effects of other drugs used in anaesthesia e Ketamine: reduces the magnitude of redistribution hypothermia (see below), maintains vasoconstriction of arterio-venous shunts during the induction of anaesthesia. e Neuromuscular blocking agents: prevent tremor of shivering and therefore generation of heat. ¢ Pethidine: also anti-shivering. Decreases the shivering threshold twice as much as the vasoconstrictor response. * Anti-cholinergic drugs: increase the threshold for sweating and promote hypothermia. o Ephedrine: increases skeletal muscle metabolism and can elevate temperatures. « Phenylephrine: causes precapillary vasoconstriction, reducing heat loss from redistribution. ¢ Midazolam has minimal influence on thermoregulatory control.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
