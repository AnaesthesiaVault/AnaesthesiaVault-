Anesthetic Goals for MR Preload: Maintain. HR: Control ventricular rate. Rhythm: Usually in AF. Chronic MR SVR: Slight decrease tolerated. Contractility: Maintain. PVR: Maintain. Chronic MR with asymptomatic and no signs of CHF usually tolerates non-cardiac surgery well. More severe MR, especially symptomatic patients, need further evaluation. Risk Mitral valve surgery is rarely indicated in patients with organic MR before elective non-cardiac surgery. Functional MR secondary to severe IHD may require myocardial revascularization and mitral annuloplasty before non-cardiac surgery. Made with QWhimsical","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
