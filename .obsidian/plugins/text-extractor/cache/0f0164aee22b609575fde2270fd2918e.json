A careful burn diagram should be completed at the time of initial evaluation, including wound size, location, and estimated burn depth. Lund-Browder chart should be used in pediatric patients because the body surface area relationships vary with age. The letters and numbers on the y and x axes can be used to demarcate site-specific changes. TBSA = total body surface area.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
