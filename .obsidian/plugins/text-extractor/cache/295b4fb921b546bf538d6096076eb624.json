Atypical antipsychotic agents have been tested primarily in small noninferiority trials with haloperidol and recently in small placebo-controlled trials in the intensive care unit (ICU). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires a “black box\" warning for all atypical antipsychotics because of in- creased risks of cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke) and death among patients with dementia. Typical antipsychotic agents have an FDA “black box” warning because of an increased risk of death among patients with dementia. EPS denotes extrapyramidal symptoms, IM intramuscular, and IV intravenous. 1 The doses recommended in this table are for older adults. “Initial” represents the initial dose for an acutely agitated older patient; the dose may need to be repeated. “Maximum” represents the maximum recommended cumulative daily dose — that is, the sum of all as-needed and scheduled doses over a period of 24 hours, Somewhat higher doses may be used in younger patients if the side-effect profile is acceptable.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
