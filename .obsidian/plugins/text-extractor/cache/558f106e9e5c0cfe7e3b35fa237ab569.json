Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Recommendations for Perioperative Care in Head and Neck Cancer Surgery With Free Flap Reconstruction Item Recommendation Evidence Recommendation Preadmission education Al patients undergoing major head and neck cancer surgery with free flap reconstruction Low Strong should receive structured teaching from a qualified health practitioner. i Perioperative nutritional All patients undergoing major surgery for head and neck cancer should undergo preoperative High Strong care comprehensive nutritional assessment, with a special focus on dysphagia and risk for refeeding syndrome. Preoperative nutrition intervention is recommended for those identified as malnourished. i A standard polymeric enteral nutrition formula should be considered suitable for use in Low Weak patients requiring preoperative nutrition support. A standard polymeric enteral nutrition formula should be considered suitable for use in Moderate Conditional patients requiring postoperative nutrition support. There are insufficient data to provide a recommendation on the use of immunonutrition Preoperative fasting should be minimized. In patients suitable for oral intake and with High (fluids), Strong (fluids), appropriate screening and management for those presenting with dysphagia or risk of low (solids), strong (solids), refeeding syndrome, clear fluids should be permitted for up to 2 hours and solids for up to low (CHO) conditional (CHO) 6 hours prior to anesthesia. Preoperative CHO treatment may be offered to head and neck cancer patients. Oral diet is the first choice for all patients tolerating it. In patients for whom oral feeding Moderate Strong cannot be established postoperative tube feeding should be initiated within 24 hours. Nutrition interventions should be developed in consultation with the multidisciplinary team and individualized according to nutritional status and surgical procedure. Prophylaxis against Patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery with free flap reconstruction are at High Strong thromboembolism increased risk of VTE and should undergo pharmacologic prophylaxis; however, the risk of bleeding must be weighed against the benefits on an individualized basis. Antibiotic prophylaxis Perioperative antibiotics are not indicated for short clean head and neck oncologic procedures. High Strong In clean-contaminated procedures, perioperative antibiotics should be given 1 hour prior to surgery and continued for 24 thours. Postoperative nausea Patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery should receive preoperative and High Strong and/or vomiting intraoperative medications to mitigate Postoperative nausea and/or vomiting. A combination prophylaxis of corticosteroid and antiemetic should be considered. Preanesthetic Patients should receive short acting anxiolytics, given intravenously and titrated to required High Strong medications effect. Long acting anxiolytics and opioids should be avoided. Standard anesthetic The anesthetic protocol should not only prevent awareness, but also minimize adverse effects Low Strong protocol and allow patients to awaken and recover rapidly; therefore, avoidance of too deep anesthesia, - especially in elderly patients, is recommended. B Preventing hypothermia Normothermia should be maintained intraoperatively. Temperature monitoring is necessary High Strong to ensure normothermia is maintained. Perioperative fluid Fluids should be managed in a goal-directed manner, avoiding over and under hydration. Moderate Strong management Routine postoperative Routine intensive care unit admission to facilitate an immediate postoperative period of deep Low Weak intensive care admission sedation and artificial respiration is not necessary.
