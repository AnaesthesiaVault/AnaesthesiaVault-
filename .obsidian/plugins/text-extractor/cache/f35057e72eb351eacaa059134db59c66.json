Postoperative The choice of the analgesia depends on the surgical approach analgesia (1aparotomy or laparoscopy), the site of the surgical incision (midline, transverse, semicurve, or Pfannenstiel-like incision), the type of surgery (colon or rectum), and patient comorbidities TEA remains the goal standard for postoperative pain control for patients undergoing open colorectal surgery. However, TEA increases the risk of arterial hypotension Spinal analgesia with intrathecal morphine, abdominal trunk blocks, intravenous lidocaine, continuous wound infiltration of local anesthetic, and wound infiltration with liposome bupivacaine are valuable analgesic techniques, especially for laparoscopic colorectal surgery A multimodal analgesic approach is recommended with the aim of providing optimal analgesia and reducing opioid consumption and side effects, with the ultimate goal of fadilitating early feeding and carly postoperative mobilization Abbreviations: GDT, goal-directed therapy; IBW, ideal body weight; MBP. mechanical bowel prep- aration; NPO, nothing by mouth; NRT, nicotine replacement therapy; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure; PONV, postoperative nausea and vomiting; TEA, thoracic epidural analgesia; TIVA, total intravenous anesthesia; TOF, train-of-four.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
