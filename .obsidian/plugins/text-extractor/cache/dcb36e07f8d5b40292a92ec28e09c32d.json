Correct placement of Verres’ needle in intrapleural space. When ventilation stops and the expiratory valve is opened to atmosphere, the expired CO, drops to zero (1). 0.5 litres of CO0, is insufflated through the Verres’ needle, partially collapsing the lung. The expired CO, concentration gradually returns to baseline at 4-5% (2). Upon resuming ventilation the waveform returns to normal (3). C. Verres’ needle in chest wall, or pleural adhesions preventing lung collapse. There is no increase in expired C0, concentration during insufflation. D. Lung puncture with Verres' needle. During insufflation, the expired concentration of C0, increases (1), on resuming ventilation, EtCO, does not return to zero (2), and increases with each successive ventilation (3).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
