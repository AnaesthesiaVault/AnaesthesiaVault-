Opioids. The mechanisms of opioid-induced antinociception are produced by opioid binding to opioid receptors in the brainstem and spinal cord. Opioid-induced decrease in arousal is produced by blockade of cholinergic arousal projections from the brainstem to the thalamus and cortex. The symbol ° denotes an excitatory effect. The symbol Q denotes an inhibitory effect. The symbols @ and @) denote inhibition of the indicated effects. ACh indicates acetylcholine; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; Glu, glutamate; LDT, laterodorsal tegmental area; mPRF, medial pontine reticular formation; NE, norepinephrine; PAF, peripheral afferent fiber; PAG, periaqueductal gray; PN, projection neuron; PPT, pedunculopontine tegmental area; RVM, rostral ventral medulla.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
