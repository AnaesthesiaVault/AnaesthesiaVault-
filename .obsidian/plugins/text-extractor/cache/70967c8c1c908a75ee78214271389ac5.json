All patients must be assessed for aspiration risk before surgery, especially urgent and emergency cases. In cases of doubt, the higher risk should be assumed. 2. Airway management strategies should be consistent with identified risk. 3. The equipment and skills to detect and manage regurgitation and aspiration should be available at all times. 4. Rapid sequence induction remains the standard technique for airway protection. 5. Those applying cricoid pressure should be trained in its application and practice applying cricoid pressure regularly. 6. In cases where tracheal intubation is not indicated, but when a small increase in aspiration exists, Second generation supra- glottic airways should be considered. 7. Strategies should be used to reduce aspiration at emergence if the patient is at risk of aspiration. 8. Anaesthetists should be aware of the prevention, detection and management of blood clot aspiration. 9. Active measure should be taken when a flat capnography trace occurs when blood has been near the airway.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
