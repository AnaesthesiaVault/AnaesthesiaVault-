Lactulose: decreases colonic pH & reduces mucosal absorption of glutamine from the gut. Aim to decrease serum ammonia but overtreatment can cause severe dehydration, hyponatremia, worsening of encephalopathy. Not recommended in ALF, consider in decompensated cirrhosis. Non-absorbable antibiotic rifaximin with few adverse effects and drug interactions is often used with lactulose Referral for Transplant in ALF: early identification and transfer after resuscitation Modified King’s College criteria for liver transplantation In ALF Paracetamol induced ALF Non-paracetamol induced ALF Either one 01:7 INR >6.5 * pH<7.30 Or, three or more of: * lactate >3.0 mmol/L after 12 h of appropriate * . >40 years old or <10 years old fesuscitation or >3.5 mmolAL after 4 h of appropriate * Bilirubin >300 umolAL resuscitation * >7 days between jaundice & encephalopathy Or, all of: * INR>3.5 * INR >6.5 or PT >100 5 * Actiology of ALF (non-A non-B or halothane hepatitis, idiosyncratic drug reaction) * Creatinine >300 pmolf. * Grade 3 or 4 encephalapathy","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
