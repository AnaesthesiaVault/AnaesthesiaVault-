Contraction starts at the end of diastole [1]. When ventricular pressure exceeds aortic pressure, the aortic valve opens and the ventricle ejects [2] until endssystolic volume and pressure approach the end- systolic pressure volume relationship (ESPVR). The slope of the ESPVR is a load-independent measure of ventricular contractility. Then, pressure in the ventricle falls exponentially during the isovolumic relaxation phase [3]. Diastolic filling occurs at low pressures along a compliant diastolic pressure volume relationship (Diastolic PVR) [4]. (b} During sepsis, systolic contractility decreases as indicated by a decrease in slope of the ESPVR. This initially results in a decrease in stroke volume (SV) before volume resuscitation occurs. The low stroke volume (short arrow) relative to the long arrow (end-diastolic volume) is ejection fraction (EF), which decreases is early sepsisinduced myocardial dysfuncion. () When septic myocardial dysfunction is severe, diasfolic dysfunction (decreased diastolic compliance) can occur as represented by a stiff diastolic pressure-volume relationship. This results in a decrease in end-diastolic volume (long arrow). Even though stroke volume is decreased by impaired diastolic filing, ejection fraction is not decreased that much because end- diastolic volume is also decreased.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
