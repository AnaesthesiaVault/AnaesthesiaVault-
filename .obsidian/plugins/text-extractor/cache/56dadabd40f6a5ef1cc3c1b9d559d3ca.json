Risk factors for atrial fibrillation and postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF), adapted from refs. [4™=,7]. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation and POAF are quite similar. The inferaction between pre-existing substrates at the level of the left atrium and surgicalinduced factors likely accounts for the development of POAF.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
