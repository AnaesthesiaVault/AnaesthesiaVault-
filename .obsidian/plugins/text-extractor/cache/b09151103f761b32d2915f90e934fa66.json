If the Resistance (R} or Compliance {C) changes, the pressure adapts gradually over a few breaths to restore the set tidal volume vT). The first breath delivered to the patient is a volume-controlled breath (Test breath); this is visible on the screen with a ‘square’ flow waveform and a ‘shark-fin’ pressure waveform for the very first breath. The patient’s compliance is determined from this volume breath and the inspiratory pressure level is then established for the subsequent PCV-VG. The potential benefit of this mode of ventilation is that patients receive same tidal volume regardless of compliance changes caused by packs, retractors, position, surgical exposure or level of relaxation. Below is an example of pressure regulated volume control (PRVC) mode of ventilation. The first ‘test breath’ evaluates the compliance. The next breath is given at the calculated target pressure. If the target volume is overshot, the next breath is delivered at a slightly lower pressure in order to achieve the target volume.
