(or is optimally managed) = (positive pressure ventilation aids the failing left ventricle; withdrawal can lead to acute left heart failure with pulmonary oedema and hence extubation failure) = If in doubt a T-piece test of no more than 30 minutes can be done. o Airway capable of being maintained by patient? = Alert, patient follows commands = No anatomical airway abnormality that is being “splinted” by the endotracheal tube. « Post extubation : nebulized adrenaline (1mg (1ml of 1:1000) plus 2ml Normal Saline) may be given if there is a concem regarding airway oedema, but is of no proven benefit.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
