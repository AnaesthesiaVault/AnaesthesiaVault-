A management protocol including the use of a handheld ultrasound device for immediate point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) examination at the bedside may improve team performance. The main objective of the study was to assess the impact of implementing such a POCUS-guided management on the proportion of adequate immediate diagnoses in two groups. Secondary endpoints included time to treatment and patient outcomes. Methods: A prospective, observational, controlled study was conducted in a single university hospital. Two teams alternated every other day for managing in-hospital ward patients developing acute respiratory and/or circulatory failures. Only one of the team used an ultrasound device (POCUS group). Results: We included 165 patients (POCUS group 83, control group 82). Proportion of adequate immediate diagno- ses was 94% in the POCUS group and 80% in the control group (p = 0.009). Time to first treatment/intervention was shorter in the POCUS group (15 [10–25] min vs. 34 [15–40] min, p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality rates were 17% in the POCUS group and 35% in the control group (p = 0.007), but this difference was not confirmed in the propensity score sample (29% vs. 34%, p = 0.53). Conclusion: Our study suggests that protocolized use of a handheld POCUS device at the bedside in the ward may improve the proportion of adequate diagnosis, the time to initial treatment and perhaps also survival of ward patients developing acute respiratory or circulatory failure.

Crit Care (2021) 25:34 Background Patients admitted to conventional hospital wards often develop acute respiratory and/or circulatory failure which requires treatment by a rapid response team (RRT) [1]. Early diagnosis and intervention may prevent further deterioration, resulting in reduced in-hospital mortality [2, 3], yet the outcomes of patients treated by RRT remain highly variable [4]. Previous studies have shown that during emergencies, point-of-care ultra- sound (POCUS) facilitates the identification of causes of respiratory and circulatory failure [5, 6]. In observa- tional studies, POCUS seems to improve the likelihood of early diagnosis in such events and decrease the time to administration of treatment [7], including in patients with both acute respiratory and acute circulatory fail- ure [8, 9]. “Handheld ultrasound devices” (HHUD) are the new generation of ultrasound devices. Their diagnos- tic capabilities have been validated against conventional ultrasound devices for focused echocardiography, lung ultrasound and deep venous thrombosis detection [10– 12]. Such devices have the advantage of being easy to use by RRT at the bedside [13], but the clinical value of such use remains unclear. We hypothesized that introduction of a RRT treat- ment protocol based on bedside cardiac and pulmonary POCUS findings in the ward would improve diagnosis, time to treatment and outcomes for patients developing acute respiratory and/or circulatory failures in the ward. The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of implementing such a POCUS-guided management on the proportion of adequate immediate diagnoses (i.e., during the event) in relation to the definitive diagnosis (i.e., upon discharge). The secondary aims were to assess the impact of POCUS on the time to immediate diagno- sis, the appropriateness of care, the need for additional diagnostic tests and patient outcomes. Methods Design A single-center, prospective, observational, controlled study was performed at the North Hospital of Mar- seille (Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux Marseille) from November 2016 to November 2018. In accordance with French law [14], patients were informed regarding the use of their data for publication. Because all strategies used in this study were considered standard of care, the study was observational and informed consent was not required. The study was compliance with the Strengthen- ing the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiol- ogy (STROBE) recommendations [15]. Characteristics of participants During the study period, all consenting adults hospital- ized in medical or surgical wards and developing res- piratory and/or circulatory failure justifying placement of a call to the RRT were prospectively included. Exclu- sion criteria were age below 18 years, pregnancy, cardiac arrest, technical limitations to the performance of ultra- sound examination in the ward (e.g., surgical dressings, anatomical abnormalities), lung or cardiac transplant, RRT calling for a neurological failure, RRT calling by the emergency department and impossible follow-up. In-hospital calls to the RRT were attended by the RRT of two intensive care units (ICUs) in the hospital which alternated every other day. In our institution, the RRT is comprised of a senior ICU physician, an ICU resident and a medical student. The two ICUs cover RRT activ- ity in turns regardless of the study; therefore, a decision was undertaken that one would serve as the POCUS group and the other would serve as the control group (no POCUS using by the control RRT). A protocol for guiding patient treatment based on POCUS findings was developed and made available only to the RRT assigned to the POCUS group (Fig. 1a, b).

Crit Care (2021) 25:34 Training and education of physicians During the three-hour training session (by a level 3 sen- ior physician [16]), typical ultrasound signs of the main causes of acute respiratory and circulatory failure were depicted. This was followed by classroom presentation of practical interactive case reports and a hands-on sce- nario-based workshop, during which the attendees were required to follow the treatment protocol with a porta- tive ultrasound device. In our department, ultrasound training sessions are offered to both senior and junior physicians twice a year by a level 3 certified senior physi- cian. All senior physicians have at least a level 2 in tho- racic ultrasound. Study protocol Calls to the RRT are placed by the physicians in charge of the patients on the ward. Such calls are typically made after an initial assessment by the senior treating physi- cian on location for the presence of organ failures. The reason for RRT intervention (acute respiratory or circu- latory failure), the indication for hospital admission and patient features are recorded routinely. Definitions of all terms used within the manuscript are summarized in Additional file 1: Table 1. Clinical assessment Each patient underwent a standard medical examina- tion by the RRT. This included taking the medical history, performance of a circulatory, respiratory and neurologi- cal assessment, monitoring of vital signs, blood testing and conduction of any additional tests judged necessary by the physician in charge. Control patients received treatment according to team assessment based on these data. Study patients also underwent a structured POCUS examination to direct care. POCUS examination in the ward Patients in the POCUS group underwent an immediate bedside POCUS examination in the ward using a hand- held ultrasound device (Vscan Dual Probe Extend™, GE Healthcare). The ultrasound examination included focused cardiac and pulmonary echography and imag- ing of the deep veins when deemed necessary. The echo- genicity of each patient was graded as poor, moderate or good. The examination was interpreted by an ICU senior physician. The POCUS protocol is detailed in Fig.  1a, b [17–20]. Immediate diagnosis: management in the ward Following clinical assessment at the bedside, each RRT selected a diagnosis from a pre-prepared list (the imme- diate diagnosis). This list was established by the investiga- tors prior to study initiation and validated by the senior physicians involved in the study [7, 9, 21] (Additional file  2: Table  2). In both groups, the time to immediate diagnosis and the time to first treatment were recorded. The number of interventions performed and the number of supplementary tests ordered per patient were collected during review of the medical files for both groups. Each RRT also recorded the treatment the patient received immediately on location and supplemental workup if such was prescribed in the ward (e.g., imaging modali- ties) as well as patient placement following triage by the RRT (ward, immediate surgery, emergency room or ICU). Patients requiring critical care were admitted to one of the two ICUs according to bed availability. Definitive diagnosis The definitive cause of respiratory and/or circulatory failure was determined following retrospective review of all patient medical files. Two physicians from each team, blinded  of the patient group and the initial diagnoses made at the bedside (BP and SH) independently reviewed all the documentation. This included nursing and medical follow-ups, physical examinations and blood and imag- ing tests. Using this documentation, each determined the definitive cause of deterioration (i.e., the “definitive diag- nosis”). In case of disagreement between the two review- ers or if doubt arose, a third expert was consulted (ML) and a consensus was looked for. In several cases, more than one cause was deemed to have led to patient dete- rioration. In such cases, all of the causes were listed by the reviewing physicians. For determining the percent of adequate diagnosis between the initial diagnosis made at the bedside and the definitive diagnosis, the list of defini- tive diagnoses reached by the reviewing physicians was compared to the diagnoses documented on the research forms on location of the event. If even one of the diag- noses on the two lists correlated, the diagnosis made at the bedside was classified as correct (Additional file  3: Table 3). Sample size considerations Overall 160 patients were required (80 per group) to detect an absolute difference of 15% between the groups in the proportion of adequate immediate diagnoses in relation to the definitive diagnoses, with an alpha risk and power of 5% and 80%, respectively. This included an assumed 10% dropout. Statistical analysis Baseline patient and treatment characteristics were com- pared between the control group and the POCUS group. The percent agreement between the immediate diagno- ses made at the bedside and the definitive diagnoses (pri- mary outcome) was compared between groups using the Page 5 of 12Zieleskiewicz et al. Crit Care (2021) 25:34 χ2 test. Comparisons of secondary outcomes were per- formed using the χ2 or Fischer’s exact tests for qualitative variables, and the Student T or Mann–Whitney tests for quantitative variables based on variable distribution. As sensitivity analysis, multivariate analysis was per- formed using logistic regressions (enter method) to determine the adjusted effect of the treatment group on in-hospital mortality. Variables were selected for model inclusion if they were of clinical interest and/or if they had a threshold p value < 0.1 in univariate analysis. The final models are presented with the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). A predefined sub- group analysis was performed according to the indication for calling the RRT (respiratory vs. circulatory). Statisti- cal analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM SPSS Sta- tistics version 20 for windows). To reduce selection bias, we performed a propensity score matching. Eight covariates were included in the propensity score model (Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, mottling’s presence, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, need for oxygen therapy, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sex). The matching was performed using the R MatchIt package and was based on the nearest neighbor with caliper matching (compiled with version 3.5.3; Feather Spray Copyright (C) 2018 The R Foundation for Statis- tical Computing). Accuracy of the score was assessed using histograms of propensity scores before and after matching and standardized mean differences (SMD) of the covariates. The matching identified 42 POCUS and 73 control individuals. All the details of the propen- sity scores are provided in Additional file  4: Additional Method. No data imputation was performed. All the tests were two-sided. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Results During the study period, 486 patients were screened. Among them, 165 patients were enrolled: 83 to the POCUS group and 82 to the control group (Fig.  2). The patients enrolled in the two groups differed only in the rate of mottling (10% in the POCUS group versus 27% in the control group, respectively, p = 0.02), the median oxygen flow rates (6, IQR [2–15] versus 12, IQR [5–15] l/min, respectively, p = 0.003) and mean arterial pres- sure (MAP) (93, IQR [72–113] versus 82, IQR [70–100] mmHg, respectively, p = 0.02). The indications for calling the RRT were similar in the two groups (Table 1). In both groups, several cases retained more than one final diag- nosis even after three reviewing rounds. The definitive diagnoses retained were similar in the two groups. Senior and junior physicians of the two teams shared the same level of expertise (Additional file 5: Table 4). Primary outcome The proportion of immediate adequate diagnosis at the bedside in the ward was 94% in the POCUS group and 80% in the control group (p = 0.009) (Table  2). In the matched cohort, the proportion of immediate adequate diagnosis was 93% in the POCUS group and 78% in the control group (p = 0.04) (Additional file 5: Table 5A). Secondary outcomes POCUS echogenicity was rated poor for cardiac assess- ment in 9% of cases and for lung assessment in 11% of cases. The time to immediate diagnosis at the bedside was similar in the two groups. However, the median time to first treatment/intervention was 15  min [IQR 10–25] in the POCUS group and 34  min [IQR 15–40] in the con- trol group (p < 0.001). This finding was most pronounced in the subgroup of patients with acute respiratory failure (p < 0.001). The proportion of appropriate intervention at the bedside was similar in the two groups. The POCUS group required less supplemental workup than the con- trol group (one additional test [IQR 1–2] versus two additional tests [IQR 1–3], p < 0.001) (Table 2). The rate of patient triage to ICU admission was 55% in the POCUS group and 72% in the control group (p = 0.15) (Table  3). For those patients admitted to the ICU, the median length of ICU stay was 3 days [IQR 2–7] in the POCUS group and 5 days [IQR 3–10] days in the control group (p = 0.01). The median hospital length of stay did not differ in the POCUS group (16  days [IQR 9–25] and in the control group (16  days [IQR 9–28] days, p = 0.44)) (Table 2). All the details of the propensity scores are provided in Additional file 5: Table 5A. The median number of interventions performed per case during bedside management in ward was three [IQR 2–4] in the POCUS group and four [IQR 3–4] in the con- trol group (p < 0.001). Patients in the POCUS group also received less invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.02), systemic steroids (p = 0.02) and vasopressors (p < 0.001) than patients in the control group (Table  3). All the details of the propensity scores are provided in Addi- tional file 5: Table 5B. ICU mortality rates were 11% in the POCUS group and 25% in the control group (p = 0.04). In-hospital mortal- ity rates were 17% in the POCUS group and 35% in the control group (p = 0.007) (Table  4). These differences were not found in the propensity cohort (p = 0.79 and p = 0.53, respectively) (Additional file 5: Table  5C). The POCUS effect on in-hospital mortality was assessed after adjustment for the main confounding factors: The effect remains significant for most models (sensitivity analyses, Additional file 7: Table 6).

Crit Care (2021) 25:34 Discussion In this single-center prospective, controlled trial, patients for whom the RRT was called underwent ward treatment that was allocated to be either POCUS- guided management directed or physician judgment directed. Patients in the POCUS group had a higher proportion of adequate immediate diagnosis, were treated more rapidly and had higher survival rates than patients treated conventionally. A seminal study showed the potential diagnostic impact of lung ultrasound in a cohort of 260 patients admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure [18]. Since then, POCUS has repeatedly been proven supe- rior to the combination of physical examination and chest X-ray for diagnosis of patients with acute res- piratory failure [5, 9, 23, 24]. In patients with acute circulatory failure, POCUS has a high diagnostic accu- racy [6, 25] and can change therapeutic management [26–28]. Despite the major differences between the ICU and the emergency department in terms of staff training and resources, similar results are consistently found in both with regards to POCUS [9, 23, 25]. Our study focused on patients hospitalized in conventional wards where resources are often limited, thereby dem- onstrating the advantage of POCUS directed treatment in an entirely different environment. POCUS can be performed by the clinician at the bed- side using a handheld device. Compared to other poten- tially relevant tests, it does not require that a device be brought by another person to the bedside, it is independ- ent of external services and it is noninvasive. POCUS has been described as the fifth pillar of physical examination [29] because it provides more physiological information Fig. 2 Flowchart. * p = 0.009, ** p = 0.007.

Crit Care (2021) 25:34 than do clinical examination, blood gases and electrocar- diography combined [30]. Improved diagnostic performance is an explanation for the earlier treatment and reduced number of supplemen- tary examinations observed in the POCUS group when compared with the control group. During emergencies, targeted POCUS screening can include assessment of cardiac function, filling and tamponade, gross valvular function, venous filling, pleural sliding and fluid accu- mulation as well as deep venous return [10, 31–33]. If a diagnosis is made using POCUS, on-site intervention can be targeted to treat the abnormal finding, thus decreas- ing the number of supplementary examinations required and also reducing the likelihood of redundant interven- tions. We did not measure the cost of treatment. How- ever, it follows that a reduction in resource use would also reduce costs. Our study suggests an association between ICU and in-hospital mortalities and structured use of POCUS during ward emergencies although these findings were not confirmed after matching.

Crit Care (2021) 25:34 certainly not on the ward. One multicenter, prospec- tive, controlled study conducted in hypotensive patients in the emergency department showed no association between the use of POCUS and patient outcomes [34]. However, the treatment provided was similar in the two arms, suggesting that benefit from the use of POCUS was not maximalized. At the same time, the study was stopped prematurely because the treating physicians felt it was unethical to resuscitate patients without the use of POCUS. Conversely, two studies suggested an asso- ciation between the use of ultrasound and patient out- comes. In a before–after study, Kanji et  al. found that limited echocardiography-guided therapy was associ- ated with a reduction in mortality in patients with shock [35]. Patients who were treated based on echocardiog- raphy findings received less intravenous fluids. In a ret- rospective analysis of a multicenter database, Feng et al. also showed that the use of echocardiography in septic patients was associated with reduced mortality. However, treatments based on echocardiography findings resulted in more fluids in the first 24  h [36]. Regardless of the amount of fluids transfused, the findings in these studies are similar to ours with regards to the association with improved outcomes. Ray et  al. showed that inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of patients in acute respiratory failure are asso- ciated with increased mortality [37]. We observed earlier intervention in the POCUS group, as did others [7]. The lower mortality rates observed with the use of POCUS may stem from earlier intervention. POCUS use reduces diagnostic uncertainty [26] and can identify life-threaten- ing conditions that would otherwise be missed [38]. The use of a handheld POCUS device has also been shown to be particularly efficient for cardiac diagnosis [39–42]. In the current study, the reduced use of invasive mechani- cal ventilation, steroids and vasopressors in the POCUS group suggests more targeted treatment in patients with an underlying cardiac cause for deterioration. In our study, the proportion of appropriate intervention at the bedside was similar in the two groups but the number of interventions was significantly higher in the control group than in the POCUS group. Thus, POCUS makes it possible to adjust early the best treatment. Our study has several limitations. It is a single-center study, which limits the extrapolation of our findings. However, the in-hospital mortality of our control group (35%) is similar to that described in other studies and aligns with the predicted mortality of our cohort [43, 44]. Our study was only controlled. Although the two groups were well balanced, the patients in the control group may have been sicker (as evidenced by their lower MAP, higher mottling scores and higher oxygen flows), and regarding the outcomes, our results were not signifi- cant after matching. However, we adjusted the mortal- ity rates to account for this potential bias and our results remained significant in most of the models chosen. There was no crossover between the two RRT. The probability of a specific team effect is reduced by the fact that dur- ing the study period a large number of seniors and jun- iors randomly composed each RRT. We focused our study on the first treatment administered by the RRT and not on treatment during the first 24  h, which may have Table 3 Administrated treatments by  the  rapid response teams at the bedside in POCUS group versus the physician judgment (control) treatment groups a a Data are expressed as no.

Crit Care (2021) 25:34 differed in the two groups. However, our patients were managed in the same institution, by similar ward physi- cians, surgeons and intensivists. Finally, the contribution of POCUS cannot be separated from that of the actual treatment protocol in our study. Regardless, the use of a combined strategy seems to be associated with improved performance. Conclusion Our clinical trial suggests that protocolized use of a handheld POCUS device at the bedside in the ward by RRT may improve the proportion of adequate diagnosis, the time to initial treatment and perhaps also survival of ward patients developing acute respiratory and/or circu- latory failure. However, because the control group was slightly sicker than the POCUS group, our results need to be confirmed by future multicenter, randomized, con- trolled trials.
