Systemic circulation Pulmonary circulation Arteries Typical pressure (systolic/diastolic) 140/80 mmHg 25/8 mmHg Typical mean pressure 100 mmHg 15 mmHg Vessel wall Thick walled, elastic Thin walled, distensible Resting vasoconstrictor tone Highly constricted at rest No vasoconstrictor tone at rest Arterioles Vessel wall Thick walls, small lumen, muscular Thin walls, large lumen Vessel resistance High resistance, typical SVR Low resistance, typical PVR 1600 dyn s cm > 160 dyn s cm > Response to hypoxia Vasodilatation Vasoconstriction Capillaries Wall thickness Thin, to allow exchange of O,, CO, and Extremely thin, to allow efficient gas nutrients exchange Blood flow Owing to high resistance in arterioles, Low resistance in arteries and flow is continuous arterioles means blood flow is still pulsatile at the capillaries Distensibility/compressibility Little change in radius, as little change ~ Compressible with increased alveolar in external/internal pressures pressure; distensible with increased pulmonary venous pressure Veins Typical mean pressure 2 mmHg 5 mmHg Venous reservoir High venous capacitance, holding Only holds around 500 mL of blood >1000 mL which can be released back which can be released back into the into the circulation if required circulation if required","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
