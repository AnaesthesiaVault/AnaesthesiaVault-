The cerebrovascular resistance determined by the caliber of the cerebral resistance vessels is regulated by various physiologic processes: (1) cardiac output (CO) likely via sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) and the renin—angiotensin—aldosterone (RAA) system, depending on the chronicity of the change m CO, (2) arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) via cerebral autoregulation, (3) cerebral metabolic activity via neurovascular coupling, and (4) arterial blood carbon dioxide (CO») and oxygen (O9) via cerebrovascular reactivity. The SNA regulates cerebral blood flow and may play a prominent role during acute hypertension and hypercapnia as a protective mechanism preventing cerebral overperfusion (dashed line). These various regulatory mechanisms, together with other CBF-regulatory mechanisms that are not specified here, such as anesthetic effects, ntegrate at the level of the cerebral resistance vessels and generate only one consequence, which is the extent of the cerebrovascular resistance and, therefore, jointly regulate brain perfusion. The plateau of the autoregulation curve shifts downward when the CO is reduced and upward when augmented. The position of the plateau is determined by the caliber (R) of the cerebral resistance vessels at high (Rpjgp), normal (Rpory), and low (Rjgy,) CO. The scale of CO on the right side is smaller than that of CBEF on the left side to reflect the lesser extent of change in CBF induced by an alteration of CO.
