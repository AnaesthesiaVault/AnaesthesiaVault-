Pre-operative 1 In patients with hypertension undergoing major surgery who have been on beta-blockers chronically, beta-blockers should be continued. (Class |, level B evidence) 2 In patients with hypertension undergoing planned elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue medical therapy for hypertension until surgery. (Class lla, level C evidence) 3 In patients with hypertension undergoing major surgery, discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin Il receptor blockers peri- operatively may be considered. (Class IIb, level B evidence) 4 In patients with planned elective major surgery and SBP of > 180 mmHg or DBP of > 110 mmHg, deferring surgery may be considered. (Class llb, level C evidence) 5 For patients undergoing surgery, abrupt pre-operative discontinuation of beta-blockers or clonidine is potentially harmful.(Class Ill, level B evidence) 6 Beta-blockers should not be started on the day of surgery in beta-blocker naive patients. (Class Il level B evidence) Intra-operative 7 Patients with intra-operative hypertension should be managed with intravenous medications until such time as oral medications can be resumed.
