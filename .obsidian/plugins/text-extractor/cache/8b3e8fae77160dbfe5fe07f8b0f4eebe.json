Activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent gene expression via prolyl hydroxylase inhibition. Under hypoxic conditions (blue arrows), HIF-a and the constitutively expressed HIF-f bind and translocate into the cell nucleus. After binding to the DNA hypoxia response promoter element, the HIF heterodimer induces expression of hypoxia-sensitive genes. Under nor- moxic conditions (red arrows), prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) hydroxylate HIF-a and thereby mark it for proteasomal degradation, effectively inhibiting HIF-dependent gene expression. Prevention of proteasomal HIF-a degradation using prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, for example, FG-2216,'* activates hypoxia-activated signaling pathways even under normoxic conditions.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
