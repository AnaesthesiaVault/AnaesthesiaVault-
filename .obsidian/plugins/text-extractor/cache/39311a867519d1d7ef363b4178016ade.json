{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20231101184913.png","text":"Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) syndrome is a biphasic process (sudden embolisation of amniotic fluid or fetal debris into maternal circulation) triggering profound alterations in haemodynamics and oxygenation. AFE results in pulmonary vasoconstriction and hypertension due to the release of arachidonic acid, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Itis characterised by four cardinal signs: * Respiratory distress * Cyanosis * Cardiovascular collapse, and * Coma. AFE is associated with decreased cardiac output, and hypotension. It can also result in disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, which is associated with prolonged PT and PTT, and thrombocytopenia. Finally, arterial blood gas typically shows hypercapnia, hypoxia and a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. Reference: Bready L, Mullins R, Noorily S, Smith R.
