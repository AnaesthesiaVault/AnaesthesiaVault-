{"path":"Zotero Images/image-5-x57-y595.png","text":"Unit of Parameter Measurement Clinical Significance EMG (electromyogram) Hz Measurement of muscle activity. The BIS value becomes less reliable as the amount of muscle activity increases. SEF95 (95th percentile of Hz Frequency below which 95% of the total EEG power lies. This value spectral edge frequency) decreases with increasing levels of general anaesthetics or opioids. TP (total power) dB Summation of the power of the various component waves. SQl (signal quality index) Percentage Quality of EEG signal, with 100% representing perfect signal quality and 0% poor signal quality. SR (suppression ratio) Percentage Proportion of a 63-second time period during which EEG activity was suppressed (ie, isoelectric). This value is inversely proportional to the BIS value.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
