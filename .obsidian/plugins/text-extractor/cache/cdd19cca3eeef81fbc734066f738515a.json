Maintains relatively constant blood flow over a range of intraluminal pressures. Local Factors Tissues regulate blood flow proportional to their metabolic rate. Metabolites Increased metabolic activity: Local 02 tension falls, and metabolite concentration (C02, H+, lactate) increases, causing vasodilation to increase blood flow and 02 delivery. Kinins s Bradykinin: Vasodilation. Histamine s Vasodilation. Released from the endothelium in response to shear stress, NOis a potent arteriolar vasodilator. Nitric Oxide (NO itric Oxide (NO) Causes venodilation, underlying techniques such as tapping the skin overlying a peripheral vein prior to cannulation.

Humoral Factors aiding ctot formation al-adrenoceptors {vasoconstriction). Adrenaline B2-adrenoceptors (vasodilation). Organ response depends on the relative proportions of al and B2-adrenoceptors. Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) === Potent arteriolar vasoconstrictor. Angiotensin || === Potent arteriolar vasoconstrictor. Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) Arteriolar vasodiiator: decreases arteriolar sensitivity to other vasoconstrictors. Noradrenaline from post-ganglionic neurons activates arteriolar al-adrenoceptors, resulting in vasoconstriction.
