{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240529080253.png","text":"Box 2: When an adult patient lacks decisional capacity* An advance directive must be honoured if the instructions and expressed preferences it contains are appropriate to the circumstances and there is no good reason to believe that the patient had subsequently changed his or her mind. If there is no advance directive, or an advance directive is not relevant to the current clinical situation, one of the following surrogates (in the order of precedence listed below) may make decisions on the patient’s behalf: 1. A proxy mandated in writing by the patient to make decisions on his or her behalf. 2. Aperson authorised by law or a court order. 3. The patient's spouse or partner 4. Parent. 5. Grandparent. 6. Adult child. 7. Brother or sister. If none of the above surrogates exists, or can be contacted, the healthcare professionals responsible for the patient's care must decide how best to proceed using the “best interests” principle (see Box 3). If the patient has never been mentally competent, or if his or her beliefs, values and preferences are unknown, the best interests principle should be applied by choosing the option a reasonable person would be most likely to prefer. Any treatment that is authorised by law or a court order or is necessary to protect public health may lawfully be carried out under the terms of the National Health Act. The NHA also allows for emergency treatment to prevent either death or ireversible damage to the patient’s health, provided the patient had not previously “expressly, impliedly or by conduct” refused such treatment. Even if a patient is found to lack the decisional capacity to make an informed choice about the proposed treatment, he or she should still be included as far as possible in the decision-making process.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
