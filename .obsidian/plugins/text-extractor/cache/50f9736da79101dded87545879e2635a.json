Arrhythmias. History Syncope, angina. Preoperative Family history of sudden death. ECG: LVH, LA enlargement, ST depression, T wave inversion. Investigations ECHO: 1/3 have obstruction at rest (peak gradient = 30 mmHg), 1/3 have provocable obstruction. Cardiac MRI/Cath. Continue chronic medications: B-blocker, CCBs to reduce LVOTO (aim for 60 bpm). Management Issues Manage anticoagulation. Conduct of Anaesthesia for HOCM Manage ICD. GA, IBP, + TOE. Preload: Full, as in aortic stenosis. Afterload: Increase; treat hypotension aggressively with a-adrenergic agonists. Contractility: Prefer depression. Rate: Normal range; B-blockers decrease LVOT gradient and increase LV end-diastolic pressure. Avoid tachycardia Intraoperative Management Rhythm: Sinus rhythm is crucial; atrial pacing modalities may be helpful. Maintain SVR: Avoid sympathetic activation MVO,: Not a problem. CPB: Start with volume and vasoconstrictors; avoid inotropes. Check carefully for residual gradient and SAM; rule out ventricular septal defect. Treat hypotension: IV fluid bolus and alpha-adrenergic agonist {phenylephrine) as first-line. Use extreme caution with inotropes to avoid worsening LYOTO and MVR.
