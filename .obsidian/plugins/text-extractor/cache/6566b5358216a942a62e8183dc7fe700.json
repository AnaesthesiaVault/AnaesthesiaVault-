In this laboratory, viscoelastic testing (ROTEMG) paradigm, samples are sent upon body temperature rewarming during CP. Our algorithm directs the corretion of hypofbrinogenaenia (using the Klaus Fibrinogen assay or FISTEM® A1 values and thrombocy- topenia. Patients whom have undergone hypothermic circulatory arrest and the ensuing platelet dysfunction of hypothermia, receive platelet concentrate transfusion ‘depending on platelet value during on-CPB rewarming values, when temperatures are >33°C. Notably, because of established institutional practices, a first set of haemo- stasis blood samples are sent to the laboratory an CPB, and in order to account for heparin effect, HEPTEM® is sent in addition to EXTEMO, Thus, if HEPTEMO is >240s, then it presumed the added prolonged dlotting fime s as result of additonal factor defciencies and requires FFP administration. A HEPTEM® CT <2405 indicates man- ‘ufacture-established values after heparin antagonism. This value aids the practitioner in deciding on FFP administration while on CPB, in order to avoid delayed initiation of coagulation management after separation from CPB. Consideration s also made to post-CPE PCC administration, as PCC usage on CPB might be less useful owing to the larger volume of distribution and potential deposition of PCC factors onto CPB filters. With appartunities for linical observation and laboratory vahues for deciding further linical intervention, various deficiencies are managed through such blood, plasma, and factor concentrate administration. Antifibrinolytic therapy is standard practice for our cardiac surgical patients tht require CPB. Notably, we have internally tested our 5U-pack of cryoprecipitate and have found fibrinogen concentration to range befween 1525 grams. We recommend a similar assessment locally within each hospital to help with best practice. Figure modified from a draft version of our local cardiac surgery trans- fusion prtocol.
