Difficult airway precautions with Vocal cord paralysis, subglottic stenosis, o laryngeal edema may make intubation difficult. immediate access to smaller- size endotracheal tubes Standard antibiotic prophylaxis Innate susceptibility to infection and immunosuppressive therapy predispose to infection risk. Caution with muscle relaxants Azathioprine and cyclophosphamide may interact with muscle relaxants. Renal protective strategies Maintain urine output, avoid hypoperfusion and hypotensive states, and use nephrotoxic drugs ‘cautiously because of possibility of subclinical lupus nephritis. Careful patient positioning Predisposition to peripheral neuropathies and osteoporosis. Antithrombotic prophylaxis Institute mechanical and pharmacological measures early, especially in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Patients with confirmed lupus anticoagulant and previous thromboembolic events warrant therapeutic anticoagulation in discussion with a hematologist. Eye protection and artificial tears/ Sjorgen’s Syndrome may predispose to comeal abrasions despite adequate eye taping. lubrication ‘Temperature monitoring, Hypothermic states may induce vasospasm in patients with Raynaud’s phenomenon. Pain management Consider side effects of systemic analgesics; regional techniques may be helpful if neuropathies, myelitis, and coagulopathies are excluded. Corticosteroid cover Adrenal suppression may have resulted from long:term corticosteroid therapy with the need for a “stress dose” perioperatively. Postoperative Pain management Regular review and input by a specialist pain service to minimize systemic side effects.
