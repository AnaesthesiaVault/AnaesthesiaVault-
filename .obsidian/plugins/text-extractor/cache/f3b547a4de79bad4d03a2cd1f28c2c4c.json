The surgical proinflammatory and pro-oxidant milieu may result in both functional and structural alterations in the endothelium, resulting in hemostatic dysregulation and impaired local fissue perfusion, with consequent microvascular and macrovascular related postoperative complication. As such, increased blood-brain barrier permeability may predispose fo increased inflammatory cell migration and consequent neurocognitive dysfunction [illusiration courtesy of Dr Marissa Ferguson).
