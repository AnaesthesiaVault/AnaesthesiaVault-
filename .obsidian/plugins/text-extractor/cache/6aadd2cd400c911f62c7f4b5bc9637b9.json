Study Design and Setting: We systematically searched PubMed for rRCTs. Study selection was performed independently by two re- viewers. We extracted all data in standardized tables and prepared descriptive summary statistics. Results: The search resulted in 1,202 hits. We included 71 rRCTs. Most rRCTs were from Denmark and Sweden. Chronic conditions were considered in 82.2%. A preventive intervention was examined in 45.1%. The median of included patients was 2,000 (range: 69e246,079). Deﬁnition of the study population was mostly broad. Study procedures were regularly little standardized. The number of included and analyzed patients was the same in 82.1%. In half of the rRCTs, more than one registry was utilized. Various linkage techniques were used. In median, two outcomes were collected from the registry/ies. The median follow-up of the rRCTs was 5.3 years (range: 6 weeks to 27 years). Information on quality of registry data was reported in 11.3%. Conclusion: rRCTs can provide valid (randomization, low lost-to-follow-up rates, generalizable) patient important long-term compara- tive-effectiveness data for relative little effort. Researchers planning an RCT should always check whether existing registries can be used for data collection. Reporting on data quality must be improved for use in evidence synthesis. \u0001 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Introduction Randomization is the only way to ensure balance of un- measured confounding factors between the treatment and control group(s) of a trial. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the only study design that can attribute causation to an (randomized) intervention. Howev- er, an RCT is expensive (e.g., center/patient recruitment, implementation of trial database). Furthermore, the lack of external validity of RCTs has often been criticized [1]. In registries, standardized patient data are collected. Registry data are usually collected under real-world condi- tions, and therefore, high external validity can be assumed [2]. But, regularly, the design of studies which are based on registry data is observational, and therefore, they are at high risk of bias because of confounding [3]. The concept of registry-based randomized trials (rRCTs) has recently received increasing attention in the medical literature [4,5]. rRCT are RCTs that build- up on a pre-existing registry. rRCT has the potential to combine the advantages of randomization (internal valid- ity) with the advantages of registries (low expense, external validity). The idea of rRCTs is promising espe- cially because standardized electronic health data are increasingly collected in routine care [6]. However, rRCTs also bring along new methodological difﬁculties (e.g., data quality, adjudication of outcomes) [7].Apart from some discussion papers describing promises and challenges based on example studies, there is no system- atic analysis of existing rRCTs [4,5,8e10]. The objective of this analysis was to provide an over- view of the characteristics and design features of existing rRCTs to get deeper insights into their strengths, weak- nesses, and challenges.

The analyzed rRCTs had large sample sizes, long follow-up periods, and only a small number of lost to follow-ups. What this study adds to what was known? \u0002 Published rRCTs indicate that this technology has the potential to provide valid (randomization, low lost-to-follow-up rates, generalizable) patient important long-term comparative-effectiveness data for less effort than ‘‘normal’’ RCTs. \u0002 In particular for pragmatic RCTs, registry-based data collection seems currently a promising alter- native to active data collection. What is the implication and what should change now? \u0002 Researchers planning an RCT should always check whether excising registries can be used for data collection. \u0002 In the construction of a new registry, the require- ments for embedding RCTs should be regarded (e.g., integrating randomization software, neces- sary data) to facilitate the conduct of future rRCTs. \u0002 To be useful for evidence-based health care (e.g., health technology assessment), reporting quality of registry data needs to be improved. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Information sources and search We systematically searched all PubMed databases for rRCTs using the search strategy in Box 1 in February 2016. The search strategy was developed according to the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies guideline [11]. Furthermore, the search strategy was reﬁned and vali- dated by checking if all relevant rRCTs known by the au- thors were identiﬁed by the search strategy. In addition to the electronic search, we cross-checked the reference lists of discussion papers on rRCTs (06/2016). 2.2. Eligibility criteria and study selection We applied the following a priori deﬁned inclusion criteria (ﬁrst two criteria conceptualize a rRCT): 1. Random allocation of participants (e.g., patients, practices, hospitals) to different interventions 2. Assessment of a least one outcome in a pre-existing registry 3. Study publication or study protocol publication available We included trials that randomized individuals as well as trials that allocated clustered units (cluster randomized trails). We were interested in all rRCTs that combined an RCT and a registry. An RCT can be completely based (single data source for the trial) or partly based (only one data source among other/s) on registries. However, there is a continuum between fully based and partly based. Therefore, we concep- tualized ‘‘partly based’’ as a collection of at least one outcome from a registry to ensure consistent inclusion.

Mathes et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 93 (2018) 120e127 Furthermore, the decision was made because the methodo- logical challenges (e.g., record linkage) are basically the same when all data are collected from the registry or only some data are collected from the registry. Different types of registries exist [2]. We considered two types of registries: patient registries and registries in a na- tional health information system. We deﬁned a patient regis- try as ‘‘an organized system that uses observational study methods to collect uniform data (clinical and other) to eval- uate speciﬁed outcomes for a population deﬁned by a partic- ular disease, condition, or exposure and that serves one or more predetermined scientiﬁc, clinical, or policy purposes’’ [2]. Hospital registries and other registries collecting data from only one institution or organization (e.g., insurance, health maintenance organization) were excluded. We delin- eated registries in a national information system as (e.g., na- tional patient registries, discharge registries) ‘‘a ﬁle of documents containing uniform information about individual persons, collected in a systematic and comprehensive way, in order to serve a predetermined purpose’’ [12]. For inclusion, the national registry had to cover a deﬁned region (e.g., coun- try, state) and had to be kept by a government or health care system institution. RRCts were included irrespectively whether the collec- tion of a registry outcome was prespeciﬁed (e.g., in the study protocol) or decided post hoc (e.g., as additional long-term follow-up). Titles and abstracts were checked against the inclusion criteria. In case a title or abstract seemed relevant, the full-text article was obtained and checked against the inclu- sion criteria. Title/abstract screening was performed ac- cording to the liberal acceleration approach [13].Full texts were assessed by two reviewers independently. We discussed any discrepancy until consensus. 2.3. Data collection We extracted data on study characteristics [patients (in- clusion/exclusion criteria), intervention and comparison, re- ported outcomes, setting, country] and methodological features (study type, sample size, details on randomization, number of outcomes, duration of follow-up, difference be- tween analyzed and randomized patients, data quality, regis- try description, record linkage techniques) in standardized piloted tables. The extraction forms included detailed expla- nations for completion. We randomly selected 10% of the included rRCTs. Data of this sample were extracted by one reviewer (T.M.), and a second reviewer veriﬁed the adequacy (correct interpretation) and correctness of entries (D.P., P.P., S.B.). In case of serious discrepancies in the ﬁrst 10%, it was planned to perform data veriﬁcation for all included rRCTs. However, the sample veriﬁcation revealed almost no discrep- ancies. Therefore, all the remaining studies (90%) were ex- tracted by one reviewer (T.M.) without further veriﬁcation. In case of uncertainty, a second reviewer was involved (D.P.). All discrepancies were discussed until consensus. The interventions were classiﬁed according to type. Data validity, completeness, and strategies to increase validity of registry data were considered as descriptions for data qual- ity of the registry data. rRCTs were considered blinded if the authors explicitly reported blinding of patients and/or personal. 2.4. Statistical analysis Dichotomous and nominal variables were described with absolute numbers and percentages. For ordinal and metric variables, we calculated median and ranges. In addition, we prepared interquartile ranges for metric variables. Means and ranges were reported for the variable proportion of patients excluded from the analysis. We performed an analysis stratiﬁed by registry type (patient registry, national health system registry, both types). All analyses were performed with SPSS 23. 2.5. Protocol and registration There was no formal protocol published for this review, but all searches, eligibility criteria, data extraction forms, and analyzes were planned before the start of the review. 3. Results 3.1. Study selection The literature search resulted in 1,202 hits after elec- tronic removal of duplicates. No further references were identiﬁed by additional searches. We assessed full texts of 156 articles. We included 71 rRCTs (9 study protocols) in the analysis. Most studies were excluded because no regis- try was used for the outcome assessment. The selection pro- cess is illustrated in the ﬂow diagram (Fig. 1). A list of included studies is provided in Supplement I at www. jclinepi.com. A list of excluded studies and complete extraction forms can be provided on request. 3.2. Study characteristics The characteristics of included rRCTs are presented in Table 1 (analysis stratiﬁed according to registry type see Supplement II at www.jclinepi.com). Most rRCTs were conducted in Denmark and Sweden fol- lowed by the USA, the UK, Canada, and the Netherlands. The ﬁrst rRCT in our analysis started in 1976 in Sweden followed by Canada, Denmark, and the USA in the 80s and 90s (see Supplement III at www.jclinepi.com). Three studies were multinational. Thirteen rRCTs (18.3%) were monocentric. Apart from infections (18.8%), all other indications (82.2%) were chronic conditions. An intervention for pri- mary prevention was examined in 45.1% of the rRCTs. The preventive interventions were mostly for cancer (53.1%), heart diseases (12.5%), and infectious diseases (18.8%). Accordingly, in the rRCTs on primary prevention, 122 T. Mathes et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 93 (2018) 120e127 screening was the great majority of the interventions (65.6%). Half of the rRCTs were on cancer screening. In the rRCTs on curative therapy, heart disease was the overwhelming indication (53.8%). Altogether pharmaco- logical treatment (28.2%), medical devices (10.3%), or sur- gical procedures (17.9%) were more than half of the rRCTs on a curative intervention (56.4%). There were also rRCTs on nonmedical interventions, in the area of coordination and organization of care (e.g., quality improvement, pro- vider education). Stratiﬁed analysis showed that in rRCTs exclusively based on patient registries (n 5 16), most often a preventive intervention was studied (43.8%). Most of these studies evaluated immunization (57.1%). Studies that only used na- tional registries were mostly on curative treatment of heart diseases (40.6%). Also, studies that used both type of reg- istries (n 5 23) were mostly studies on prevention (56.5%). Of the prevention studies, 76.9% evaluated an intervention for cancer prevention. Deﬁnition of the study population was mostly broad. Apart from the inclusion/exclusion criteria to deﬁne the population at risk (e.g., age, gender) or the target diseases (e.g., signs and symptoms), usually, there were no or only a few additional inclusion/exclusion criteria. Furthermore, the study procedures and follow-up interventions were regularly little standardized. 3.3. Design features The design features of included rRCTs are presented in Table 2 (analysis stratiﬁed according to registry type see Supplement IV at www.jclinepi.com). Eight rRCTs were cluster (practices or hospitals) rRCTs (11.3%). One of these was a stepped wedge cluster rRCT. In the 63 remaining rRCTs (88.7%), randomization was performed at individual level. There were two tree arm studies. All other studies were two arm parallel group rRCTs, that is, had no special methodological design fea- tures. Blinding (participants and/or personal) was applied in six rRCTs (8.5%). The median number of included pa- tients was 2,000 (interquartile range: 533e17,793; min., 69; max., 246,079). Studies that were based on different types of registries were largest (median: 7,244). In 56 (82%) rRCTs, the number of included and also the number of analyzed patients were reported. In 46 of these rRCTs (82.1%), the number of included patients was the same as the number of analyzed patients (i.e., analysis according to intention to treat). In 54 (96.4%), the proportion of Fig. 1. Flow diagram of study selection. 123T. Mathes et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 93 (2018) 120e127 patients excluded from the analysis was less than 10%. In one rRCTs, there was more than 20% missing data. The mean percent of missing patients in studies that excluded patients from the analysis was 5.5% (min !1%; max 21%). In half of the rRCTs, more than one registry was utilized. Of the utilized registries, 37.1% were patient registries, that is, registries on a certain disease (primarily cancer and heart diseases), condition (primarily risk groups), or exposure (pri- marily immunization). The health system registries were mostly national registries (registries of all patients, mortality registries, registries of residents). The smallest amount of missing data was found in studies that used different types of registries. In 69.6% of these studies, all randomized pa- tients were included in the analysis. In median, two outcomes were collected from the registry/ies. About half of the rRCTs (47.9%), gathered only one outcome from the registry. rRCTS that were based only on a patient registry collected in median one outcome from the registry, whereas studies that were based on a national registry or different types of reg- istries collected in median two outcomes from the registry/ ies. Mortality based on registry data was assessed in 61% of the rRCTs. The proportion of rRCTs gathering mortality was largest in studies that were based on different types of registries (87.0%). Outcomes that were also often based on a registry were immunization rates, hospitalizations, morbidity (e.g., incident cancers, incident heart diseases, complications), and reinterventions. A composite outcome was assessed in 19.7% of the rRCTs. In 81.7% of the rRCTs, the primary outcome (used for sample size calculation and/or authors declared as primary) was from a registry. The other rRCTs (18%) utilized the registry for secondary or additional outcome assessment or for an extension of the follow-up duration. The median follow-up of the rRCTs was 5.3 years (minimum 6 weeks; maximum 27 years). The length of follow-up was longest in rRCT that was based on different types of registries (7.8 years). Information on quality of registry data or measures to ensure quality of registry data was reported in eight rRCTs (11.3%). Information on methods for record linkage was provided in 27 publications. Various techniques were used for linking randomization results with the registry. In the national health system registries, a unique patient identiﬁer (70.4%) was mostly used for linking the randomization result to the registry and also for linking different registries. In four patient registry-based RCTs, the randomization result was recorded in the registry or the randomization was performed within the registry. Probabilistic record link- age techniques were also applied in four rRCTs. 4. Discussion We included 71 rRCTs in our analysis on rRCTs. The rRCTs were mainly on primary prevention, pharmacological Table 1.

Mathes et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 93 (2018) 120e127 therapies, and surgical procedures. Many rRCTs had large sample sizes and long follow-ups. Data on standardization of outcome assessment was sparse. Furthermore, only six of the rRCTs applied some kind of per- sonal and/or participant blinding. These are possible threats to the internal validity. Thus, currently rRCTs might be consid- ered rather a promising tool for health technology assessment and comparative-effectiveness research than for market approval trials, especially in the area of pharmacology. How- ever, in general, registries should only be considered as a data source because they have no inherent study design features. Theoretically, all design aspects that can be applied to ‘‘normal’’ RCTs, like blinding, allocation concealment, anal- ysis according to per-protocol etc. can be applied to rRCTs, premised the registry contains the necessary data, and provides the necessary technical infrastructure (e.g., integrating a randomization program). This implies that all measures to enhance internal validity can also be applied and ultimately that also efﬁcacy trials can be performed based on registry data. We identiﬁed a noninferiority trial, factorial design, blinded trials, centrally randomized trials, trials with highly speciﬁed study collectives, etc. [14e16] also. Many rRCTs collected the primary outcome from a reg- istry. The reason is probably that there is often no other possibility to ensure follow-up or to reach the target popu- lation (e.g., screening of healthy people in a complete re- gion). However, most of the registry outcomes had low event rates (e.g., mortality, rehospitalization), and conse- quently, large sample size and long follow-ups are needed. Therefore, in the case that another patient relevant outcome exists, which requires smaller sample sizes and shorter follow-up (e.g., quality of life), active collection of the primary outcome and supplemental use of a registry outcome (e.g., long-term safety evaluation in the interven- tion group) might be more efﬁcient. Quality of registry data was rarely explicitly reported. However, many rRCTs used hard end points from the registry (e.g., mortality, hospitalization) that are at low risk of bias because of inconsistent deﬁnitions or subjective ascertain- ment. Moreover, the data quality had to be considered in com- parison to ‘‘normal’’ RCTs. The source data for a registry and clinical trial databases are basically the same (e.g., patient re- cords, pathological databases, clinical information system). For example, the entries for data on hospital admission (e.g., to quantify length of hospital stay) from the clinical informa- tion system might provide the source data for a case report form of ‘‘normal’’ trial as well as for a patient registry. If the same source data are used (e.g., clinical information system for hospital admissions), there can be no differences, excepting transcription errors. In the studies that reported on lost to follow-ups or data completeness, there were only a few missing outcome values. Furthermore, follow-up in coun- tries with national health registries and unique personal iden- tiﬁers is probably quite complete, especially if different registries are linked for veriﬁcation (e.g., patient registry and mortality registry) [17,18]. However, also in studies that re- ported missing data or lost to follow-ups, information on imputing missing values for the intention-to-treat analysis was hardly ever given. We could not systematically assess the number of other data sources (e.g., clinical information system) in addition to the registries because of insufﬁcient reporting. However, registry/ies often seemed to be the only data source. This was probably possible because data collection was mostly limited to the essential outcomes or linkage of different reg- istries. Moreover, in registries, usually baseline data (demo- graphics etc.) are collected. Therefore, it can be assumed that in most rRCTs, baseline data were mainly from a reg- istry as well. Consequently, an infrastructure, or if any not the complete new infrastructure for data collection (e.g., electronic case report forms, trial data base, monitoring), has not to be implemented. If the registry was a comple- mentary data source (e.g., to a clinical trial database), it seemed to be used especially for long-term follow-up (e.g., after termination of the original study). In some rRCTs, the same outcome was assessed using different reg- istries (e.g., an administrative database and a patient regis- try) and linked for data veriﬁcation or reducing the number of missing values. In some rRCTs (e.g., reminder for immu- nization), registry was also frequently used to identify eligible patients. In view of the low effort for data collec- tion in conjunction with the tendency of little changes of the clinical routine (pragmatic approach), it can be assumed that most studies were performed for relative low expense, compared to ‘‘normal’’ RCTs. However, also for a registry, cost arises especially for institution and implementation. Also for maintaining a registry, ﬁnancial resources are necessary. Table 2.

Mathes et al. / Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 93 (2018) 120e127 Number of included patients and number of assessed out- comes were largest in rRCTs that were based on different types of registries. Moreover, these rRCTS had the longest follow-up and the lowest amount of missing data. This obser- vation indicates that using different registries types can reduce the need for additional active data collection. There was a large proportion of rRCTs from Denmark and Sweden. These are countries where habitants have a unique identiﬁcation number. In countries with unique patient iden- tiﬁers and in patient registries, record linkage is quite simple and distinct. However, a restriction might be laws on the med- ical data protection or general data security laws [19].In these case or if no unique patient identiﬁer exists, probabi- listic record linkage techniques might be applied [20].If different registries are linked, the probability is increased that all necessary data are available and no further infrastructure for data accusation has to be implemented or limitations of the design are necessary (e.g., reduction of sample size, confounder). However, this is only an option, if the correct linkage probability is high. Most of the included rRCTs can be considered pragmatic [21]. The rRCTs often included a diverse population (few and broad inclusion/exclusion criteria), recruiting patients from multiple providers (multicenter studies) and multiple regions (nation or region-wide). In most studies, no ‘‘special’’ meth- odology was applied (e.g., cluster randomization, adaptive designs). Furthermore, considering the description of inter- ventions and the description of the follow-up period, it can be assumed that provision of intervention and care are also little standardized. Therefore, most rRCTs might be attrib- uted high external validity. In nonpharmacological medical research areas (e.g., screening, surgical procedures, organization, and coordina- tion of care), often high-quality RCTs are sparse [22] due to less ﬁnancial power and weaker approval requirements compared to drugs [23]. Thus, rRCTs are a promising tech- nology especially in nonpharmacological research areas. In contrast, usually, the registry, in particular national regis- tries, will not contain all relevant data for an explanatory trial (e.g., safety monitoring for a pivotal drug trial). But also for drug trials, the registry can be used as a comple- mentary data source for long-term follow-up, assessing pa- tient important outcomes etc. and thus contribute to close the gap between information needed by health technology assessment agencies (effectiveness) and drug approval agencies (efﬁcacy), that is, to cross the boundaries between phase III and IV trials. In patient registry-based rRCTs, often other outcomes than mortality were assessed, including composite out- comes and clinical outcomes, safety outcomes. This shows that potentially all necessary data can be collected in a reg- istry. Hence, if already considered in the registry construc- tion, it would be also possible to collect very detailed data such as needed for drug approval. Again, including such detailed data in national registries (e.g., inpatient data ba- ses) would not be reasonable. Ethical aspects might be a challenge in rRCTs [7].We did not systematically assess ethical aspects. However, we recognized that in most studies, there seem not to be a dif- ference to ‘‘normal’’ RCTs. Almost all studies reported the obtainment of a written informed consent and often referred to the Declaration of Helsinki [24]. Furthermore, in studies that used national registries, it was often stated that data were anonymized via the personal identiﬁer. Researchers should take in consideration using existing registries for enrollment, allocation, and data collection when planning a trial. The availability of the necessary data and requirements on data quality are the key aspect for the decision about using pre-existing registries. Using a rRCT should be in particular considered for the evaluation of health technologies that can only be sufﬁciently evaluated with large sample sizes and long-term follow-up (e.g., screening) or in areas where studies are very difﬁcult to conduct (e.g., emergency measures). At the moment, re- searchers setting-up an rRCT should rather consider pragmatic trial designs because existing registries will regularly not contain all information needed for an explan- atory trail. Furthermore, we recommend checking, if the data quality is sufﬁcient for the research purpose before conduct of the study (e.g., using existing validation reports, performing an own validation on a subsample). This is in particular important in the case that the primary outcome is a registry outcome. rRCT should be primarily used to gather objective outcomes, in particular if no information on data quality is available. The reduced expense for col- lecting data should be always balanced against the poten- tial loss of data quality. We suggest that for the conduct of an rRCT, each patient should get a personal identiﬁer (if agrees with data privacy). A unique personal identiﬁer would facilitate a clear identiﬁcation in the registry, randomization within the registry, and if the same number for different registries is used, easier linkage of different registries compared to probabilistic linkage. In the construction of new registries, the possibility should be considered to embed future RCTs (e.g., assigning a unique personal identiﬁer, implementing processes for data validation). Considering the integration in advance can facilitate future rRCTs. Here, also the research ques- tions and target audiences (drug approval agencies, health technology assessment agencies) of future rRCTs should be regarded to judge which data should be collected in the (e.g., safety data, patient important outcomes) registry and to decide about measures to ensure data quality (e.g., intensity of data quality monitoring, scope of validation). A limitation of our analysis is the search strategy. There might be many publications only reporting data sources for outcomes in the full-text publication but not in the abstract. Consequently, these rRCTs would not have been identiﬁed by searching electronic databases. Furthermore, data of 90% of included studies were extracted by only one reviewer which increases the risk of extraction errors compared to an extraction by two independent reviewers. 126 T.

Conclusion rRCTs can provide valid (randomization, low lost-to- follow-up rates, generalizable) patient important long- term comparative-effectiveness data for relative little effort. Reporting of data quality has to be improved, to allow a judgment of data quality. This is in particular important for the use of rRCTs in evidence-based medicine and health technology assessment. This overview of characteristics and design features of existing rRCT can serve as an incep- tion for further methodological research on rRCTs (e.g., development of reporting checklist). Researchers planning an RCT should always check whether existing registries can be used for data collection to reduce effort. In the construction of a new registry, the requirements for embedding RCTs should be regarded (e.g., integrating randomization software) to facilitate the conduct of future rRCTs.
