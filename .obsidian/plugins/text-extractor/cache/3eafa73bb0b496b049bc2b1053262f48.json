After the onset of brain injury, blockade of excessive stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors by ketamine reduces calcium influx through the receptor channel (1). This attenuates supraphysiological increases in the assembly and interaction of NMDA receptor subunits, postsynaptic density proteins, and other mtracellular signaling systems such as protein kinases (2). Thus, several kinase transduction cascades become less activated. This improves the preservation of metabolism and maintenance of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (3). This, in turn, reduces pathological activation of transcription factors (4). Proteins involved in apoptosis are less activated, which is associated with less DNA fragmentation (5). Better preservation of synaptic proteins occurs, and the expression of growth proteins indicating regeneration in adult neurons is enhanced (6, 7). The prevention of pathological amplification of NMDA receptor signaling finally results in increased cellular survival, preserved cellular and synaptic integrity, and regenerative efforts (8). *Superiority of effects induced by S(+)- ketamine, only.
