The resulting calculated SID (in vitro-SID) is equal to 0 mEq/L, due to electrical neutrality. Once infused, the organic molecules are metabolized to CO, and water; the resulting in vivo-SID corresponds to the amount of organic anions metabolized @ Sterofundin-ISO or Ringerfundin b In vivo-SID of Tetraspan reported in the Table results from the sum of organic anions; of note, there is a discrepancy as compared to the SID calculated as the difference between inorganic cations and inorganic anions (29 mEq/L vs. 33 mEq/L).
