{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240317095634.png","text":"ACS refers to a spectrum of conditions of varying myocardial ischaemic states. It can be broadly categorized into two groups, depending on evidence of myocardial ischaemia on an electro- cardiogram (ECG) and evidence of myocardial necrosis from serum levels of cardiac biochemical markers (e.g. troponin): ¢ ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) ¢ Non-ST elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS): o Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI] (asso- ciated troponin rise). o Unstable angina (no myocardial cell necrosis/troponin increase). In general, STEMI is associated with more prolonged duration of ischaemia and a larger territory of myocardial necrosis (e.g. after a complete artery coronary occlusion) than NSTEMI. The short- term mortality from STEMI is marginally higher than that from NSTEMI, but the 4-yr mortality rate for patients with NSTEMI is twice that of STEMI patients.® The incidence of STEMI has de- clined over the past 20 yr* whereas the incidence of NSTEMI re- mains unchanged or has even increased. Improved quality and timeliness of treatment for ACS has resulted in a decrease in hos- pital mortality from around 20% to nearer 5% over the past 30 yr.*","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
