BACKGROUND: Pilot studies applying point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in preeclampsia indicate the presence of pulmonary interstitial edema, cerebral edema, and cardiac dysfunction. Laboratory markers of oncotic pressure (albumin) and cardiac dysfunction (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]) may be abnormal, but the clinical application remains unclear. We investigated the prevalence of pulmonary interstitial syndrome (PIS), cardiac dysfunction, and increased optic nerve sheath diam- eter (ONSD) in late-onset preeclampsia with severe features. The primary aim was to examine the association between PIS or ONSD and maternal serum albumin level. The secondary aims were to explore the association between cardiac dysfunction and PIS, ONSD, BNP, and serum albumin level and between POCUS-derived parameters and a suspicious or pathological cardiotocograph. METHODS: Ninety-five women were enrolled in this prospective observational cohort study. A POCUS examination of lungs, heart, and ONSD was performed. PIS was defined as a bilateral B-line pattern on lung ultrasound and diastolic dysfunction according to an algorithm of the American Society of Echocardiography. ONSD >5.8 mm was interpreted as compatible with raised intracranial pressure (>20 mm Hg). Serum BNP and albumin levels were also measured. RESULTS: PIS, diastolic dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, and raised left ventricular end-dia- stolic pressure (LVEDP) were present in 23 (24%), 31 (33%), 9 (10%), and 20 (25%) women, respectively. ONSD was increased in 27 (28%) women. Concerning the primary outcome, there was no association between albumin level and PIS (P = .4) or ONSD (P = .63). With respect to secondary outcomes, there was no association between albumin level and systolic dysfunction (P = .21) or raised LVEDP (P = .44). PIS was associated with diastolic dysfunction (P = .02) and raised LVEDP (P = .009; negative predictive value, 85%). BNP level was associated with systolic (P < .001) and diastolic dysfunction (P = .003) and LVEDP (P = .007). No association was found between POCUS abnormalities and a suspicious/pathological cardiotocograph (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: PIS, diastolic dysfunction, and increased ONSD were common in preeclampsia with severe features. Cardiac ultrasound abnormalities may be more useful than albumin levels in predicting PIS. The absence of PIS may exclude raised LVEDP. The further clinical relevance of PIS and raised ONSD remains to be established. BNP level was associated with cardiac ultrasound abnormalities. Although this study was not designed to directly influence clinical management, the findings suggest that POCUS may serve as a useful adjunct to clinical examination for the obstet- ric anesthesiologist managing these complex patients.

June 2019 • Volume 128 • Number 6 www.anesthesia-analgesia.org 1209 P reeclampsia is a life-threatening hypertensive disor- der involving the heart and vasculature and affecting 5%–8% of pregnancies. 1 Predominant causes of mater- nal morbidity and mortality are cerebral complications and cardiorespiratory failure. 2 Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is being used increas- ingly in preeclampsia for diagnostic purposes.3 Using lung ultrasound, 2 recent pilot studies detected pulmonary interstitial syndrome (PIS) in 25% of women presenting with preeclampsia with severe features.4,5 Such increases in pulmonary interstitial fluid may precede alveolar edema, which is known to be associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.6 In both studies, the authors concluded that women with PIS should be fluid restricted. However, the precipitating factors, whether cardiac or noncardiac, such as decreased oncotic pressure related to hypoalbuminemia, remain controversial. 7 Another POCUS application is to assess for increased optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), which has been shown in other clinical disciplines to be associated with raised intracranial pressure (ICP). 8 In a pilot investigation, ONSD was found to be normal in healthy controls, but increased in 5 of 26 (19%) preeclamptic women.9 The clinical application of this finding remains unclear. As in PIS, it has been hypothesized that reduced serum albumin level, an important determinant of oncotic pressure and biomarker of disease severity,10,11 might contribute to cerebral edema. 12 In a subset of preeclamptic women, signs of diastolic dysfunction and impaired myocardial contractility can be demonstrated with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). 13 Knowledge of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, as well as the risk for the development of pulmonary edema in the individual case, is essential to the obstetric anesthesiolo- gist to guide appropriate hemodynamic and fluid manage- ment. As the anesthesia provider does not have ready access to a comprehensive TTE study performed by a cardiologist, POCUS protocols have been developed and used success- fully by noncardiologists during recent years.14 This implies a defined bedside ultrasound examination to identify criti- cal pathophysiological processes that remain undetected by clinical examination alone. 14 However, data on its applica- tion in preeclampsia are limited.3 It is further well documented that the serum brain natri- uretic peptide (BNP) level, a marker of cardiac dysfunction, is increased in preeclampsia. 15,16 However, there are insufficient data to confirm that elevated BNP levels identify those pre- eclamptic women at risk for cardiopulmonary abnormalities. 17 Therefore, this study was planned to describe the preva- lence of POCUS-derived abnormalities in women present- ing with late-onset preeclampsia with severe features. The primary aim was to examine the association between PIS or ONSD and maternal serum albumin level. The secondary aims were to explore the associations between cardiac dysfunction and PIS, ONSD, BNP, and serum albumin level. The associa- tion between POCUS-derived parameters and a suspicious or pathological cardiotocograph (CTG) was also analyzed. METHODS After approval by the institutional Human Research Ethics Committee, and written informed consent, women pre- senting with late-onset preeclampsia (>34 weeks gestation) with severe features were enrolled in this prospective observational study. The investigation was conducted at the University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa (number: IRB 864/2015) in collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, and the University of Washington, Seattle, WA (number: IRB HSD 50964), in accor- dance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. This observational study was reported using the guidelines of strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE)18 and registered under ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT 02721771, Principal Investigator: R.A.D., date of registration: March 10, 2016). Subjects Women presenting with late-onset preeclampsia with severe features, admitted to Mowbray Maternity Hospital, a regional obstetrics state hospital facility in Cape Town, South Africa, were screened for enrollment by 1 of 2 study investigators (M.F., E.N.) not providing clinical care. Because women with early-onset disease were referred to a different central hospital facility, only women presenting with late-onset disease were enrolled. Preeclampsia was defined according to the recom- mendations of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 19 and regarded as severe if systolic blood pressure exceeded 160 mm Hg and/or the diastolic blood pressure exceeded 110 mm Hg on ≥2 separate occasions after admission, and proteinuria on urine dipstick was ≥3+, or if there were other clinical features of severity (severe head- aches or visual disturbances, renal impairment, impaired liver function tests, and/or thrombocytopenia). Late-onset disease was defined as diagnosis after 34 weeks’ gestation. After informed consent, maternal ultrasound examina- tion was performed at the time of hospital admission, after diagnosis and initiation of the established local treatment protocol of University of Cape Town. Seizure prophylaxis was administered, consisting of magnesium sulfate given as a loading dose of 4 g intravenously, followed by 1 g mag- nesium sulfate per hour. Preeclamptic women were fluid restricted to <100 mL crystalloid per hour. Blood pressure was managed according to a standardized protocol, using nifedipine, dihydralazine, or labetalol for acute manage- ment, to reduce systolic blood pressure to <160 mm Hg. When stable, patients were started on a maintenance dose of α-methyldopa, with subsequent nifedipine for breakthrough hypertension if systolic blood pressure was >160 mm Hg. The CTG was interpreted according to the guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.20 One nonreassuring feature (early or variable decelerations; fetal basal heart rate, 100–119 or 160–179 beats per minute [bpm]; or variability <5 bpm for ≤40 minutes) and 2 nor- mal/reassuring features on CTG defined a suspicious fetal heart tracing, which was considered to be an indication for intrauterine fetal resuscitation. Two or more nonreassuring features or ≥1 abnormal features on CTG (late or prolonged [>3 minutes] decelerations; fetal basal heart rate, <100 or >180 bpm; or variability <5 bpm for >90 minutes) defined a pathological fetal heart tracing, which was considered to be an indication for cesarean delivery. The decision to proceed with cesarean delivery was made by the obstetrics team, independent of the investigators. Copyright © 2018 International Anesthesia Research Society.

Women with chronic pulmonary disease, collagen disorders, a history of lithium intoxication, chronic renal or hepatic disease, urinary tract infection, chorioamnionitis, intrauterine fetal death, a body mass index >50 kg·m −2, or acute asthma were not consid- ered eligible. Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasound procedures were performed following the recommendations of the Society for Critical Care Anesthesiologists on conducting focused critical care basic ultrasound. 21 All ultrasound studies were performed by 1 of 2 trained echocardiography investigators (C.M.O., E.N.) not involved in patient care. A Vivid S6 BT 12 machine with an M4S-RS 1.5–3.6 MHz cardiac transducer (General Electric Healthcare, Boston, MA) was used for lung and cardiac ultrasound, and a 12L-RS 6.0–13.0 MHz transducer for optic nerve ultrasound. Ultrasonography images were stored, converted to Digital Images and Communications in Medicine format, and analyzed offline in a blinded manner. Approximately 10% of the scans were randomly selected for reevaluation, for calculation of intra- and interobserver variability. Lung Ultrasound. Lung ultrasound was performed using the validated 8-region method, 22 evaluating 2 anterior regions and 2 lateral regions in each hemithorax. Hyperechoic horizontal artifacts arising from the pleural line have been denoted A-lines22 (Supplemental Digital Content 1, Figure 1A, http://links.lww.com/AA/C557). PIS was assessed by the presence of multiple B-lines, defined as discrete laser-like vertical hyperechoic reverberation artifacts that arise from the pleural line to the bottom of the screen, moving as the pleural surfaces slide during respiration 22 (Supplemental Digital Content 1, Figure 1B, http://links. lww.com/AA/C557). Three or more B-lines (any size and any distance apart) in a particular region defined a positive lung region. PIS was diagnosed in the presence of ≥2 posi- tive regions per side, which defined a “B-line pattern.” 22 The total number of B-lines counted in all windows defined the B-line score. Less than 2 positive regions per side defined an “A-line pattern.” 22 Cardiac Ultrasound. Parturients rested in the left lateral position for ≥10 minutes before echocardiography. Left ven- tricular parameters were measured according to the recom- mendations of the American Society of Echocardiography, 23 using parasternal and apical echocardiographic windows. Left ventricular systolic function was measured using the Quinones method, 24 and systolic dysfunction was defined as fractional shortening (FS) <25% (left ventricular inter- nal diameter in diastole − left ventricular internal diameter in systole)/(left ventricular internal diameter in diastole). Systolic function was secondarily assessed by “eyeball” ejection fraction estimated from the apical 4-chamber view 25 and by measuring left ventricular fractional area change (FAC) in the parasternal short-axis view. 25 Left ventricular diastolic function was assessed using pulsed-wave and tissue Doppler evaluation of the mitral valve apparatus. Left ventricular early mitral peak flow velocity (E) was measured using pulsed-wave Doppler with sample volume at the tips of the opening mitral leaflets, and mitral annular tissue velocity (E′) was measured using the tissue Doppler function. Diastolic dysfunction and cardiac filling pressures were defined following the recommenda- tions available during patient recruitment and published by the European Society of Cardiology and American Society of Echocardiography. 26,27 After the “practical approach to grade diastolic dysfunction,” diastolic dysfunction was defined as septal and lateral E′ <8 and 10 cm/s, respectively. 26 Raised left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was defined as average E/E′ >13 and/or septal and/or lateral E/E′ ratio >15 and 12, respectively. 26 Normal LVEDP was defined as E/E′ ≤8. An average E/E′ ratio between 9 and 13 is consid- ered nondiagnostic, and guidelines26–28 recommend addi- tional invasive or noninvasive testing. Following European Society of Cardiology consensus statement,27 a concurrent serum BNP >200 pg/mL is suggestive of increased cardiac filling pressures. Consequently, increased LVEDP was fur- ther defined by a mean E/E′ value of 9–13 in addition to a serum BNP level of >200 pg/mL. A more detailed descrip- tion of cardiac ultrasound methodology can be found as Supplemental Digital Content 2–3, Material I, http://links. lww.com/AA/C558, Figure 2, http://links.lww.com/AA/ C559. Measurement of ONSD. For the purpose of ONSD mea- surement, the patient was positioned supine, with the head elevated 30°. The entry of the optic nerve into the globe was observed by placing the linear transducer superior and lat- eral to the eye, above the upper eyelid. For each optic nerve, 2 measurements were made, one in the transverse plane and the other in the sagittal plane. ONSD was calculated by tak- ing the mean of the 4 values (2 per eye). Increased ICP was defined as a bilateral mean ONSD >5.8 mm. 9,29 An illustra- tive example appears in Supplemental Digital Content 1, Figure 1C, http://links.lww.com/AA/C557. Blood Sampling. Venous blood samples were obtained from the extremity contralateral to the peripheral venous access. BNP was measured from 1 blood specimen imme- diately after sampling, with a designated BNP cartridge on an i-STAT Analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Samples of separated plasma were sent to the central hospi- tal laboratory services and analyzed for serum albumin, by a fully automated analyzer (Hitachi 917; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Statistical Analysis Data were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables, and frequency and percentage for categorical variables. For the a priori–defined ultrasound outcomes of PIS, diastolic dysfunction, and increased ONSD, the prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. In addition, the prevalence and 95% CIs of systolic dysfunction and of raised LVEDP were calculated. Patients with and without ultrasound abnormalities were compared with respect to admission systolic and diastolic blood pressures, clinical features of disease severity, and mean serum albumin and BNP levels using 2-sample t test and the χ2 test, for continuous and categorical variables, Copyright © 2018 International Anesthesia Research Society.

The associations between PIS and increased ONSD or diastolic dysfunction with clinical severity fea- tures, serum albumin level, BNP level and between cardiac and pulmonary ultrasound abnormalities were explored using the 2-sample t test and the χ 2 test, for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The association between the presence of PIS, increased ONSD or diastolic dysfunc- tion, and a suspicious or pathological CTG were explored using a univariate, binomial regression model with robust standard errors. To adjust for multiple comparisons, including primary and secondary outcomes, the Benjamini–Hochberg correc- tion was applied, using a 10% false discovery rate. Given the P value results of 32 direct comparisons made in the study, the significance level was adjusted to P < .025. To determine pre- and post-test probabilities of PIS to predict elevated LVEDP, and of BNP at a level >200 pg/mL to predict systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, ele- vated LVEDP, and the presence of PIS, sensitivity, specific- ity, positive, and negative predictive value were calculated. Intraobserver and interobserver variabilities were evalu- ated using the Bland and Altman method, after reviewing 10% of lung (using total B-line score), cardiac (using left ventricular internal diameter in diastole [LVEDD]), and optic nerve (using the left ONSD) parameters; results were expressed both graphically and quantitatively as mean dif- ference (bias) and 95% limits of agreement. Sample Size Calculation The sample size calculation was based on the primary aim, which was to examine the association between PIS or ONSD and maternal serum albumin level. Available data suggested that the incidences of PIS and increased ONSD detected by ultrasound in preeclampsia with severe features were 24% and 25%, respectively. 9,30 Prior data in critically ill patients indicate a mean serum albumin level of 2.8 g/dL (SD, 0.7) in patients with normal lung water, compared to 2.2 g/dL (SD, 0.7) in patients with increased lung water.31 With the biologically plausible assumption of a similar relationship in preeclampsia, where prior data suggest a mean serum albumin level ranging from 2.4 to 2.9 g/dL in severe dis- ease,11 and considering an α level of .05 and a power of 0.9, a sample size of 80 women was needed to show a difference of 0.6 g/dL (SD, 0.7) in serum albumin level in patients with and without PIS, or with and without raised ONSD, assum- ing an unequal allocation ratio of 3. For the secondary aims (investigation of the association between PIS or ONSD and cardiac dysfunction, BNP, and serum albumin level, and the association between POCUS- derived parameters and a CTG that was suspicious or pathological), no formal sample size calculation was done, and results were considered exploratory and hypothesis generating. RESULTS Demographical, Clinical, and Laboratory Features Of the 201 patients initially screened, 95 patients were enrolled (pulsed-wave Doppler measurements were incom- plete in 15 cases, necessitating the recruitment of 15 addi- tional patients to allow for a complete analysis in 80 patients, as per sample size calculation). Figure 1 shows the detailed flow diagram and numbers analyzed. Demographical and clinical characteristics of the patient cohort are shown in Table 1. With regard to a priori–defined ultrasound abnor- malities, 56 (59%; 95% CI, 48.4–68.9) patients had ≥1 ultra- sound abnormality. Thirty-four (36%; 95% CI, 26.2–47.3) had 1 ultrasound abnormality, and 22 (23%; 95% CI, 15.1–32.9) had ≥2 ultrasound abnormalities. Patients with and without ultrasound abnormalities were comparable with respect to admission hemodynamic findings and clinical features of disease severity. Severe headaches or visual disturbances were present in 84% of women with ultrasound abnor- malities and 64% of women without these abnormalities (P = .03). Regarding admission laboratory findings, mean serum BNP and albumin levels were 304.0 pg/mL and 31.6 g/L, respectively, in women with ultrasound abnormali- ties, and 124.3 pg/mL (P = .03) and 33.4 g/L, respectively, (P = .03) in women without ultrasound abnormalities. Ultrasound Findings Table 2 describes the ultrasound findings in the cohort, and Figure  2 describes the prevalence of the major ultrasound abnormalities (diastolic and systolic dysfunction, PIS, raised LVEDP, and elevated ONSD). Association Between Ultrasound Abnormalities and Laboratory Markers These associations are presented in Table 3. With respect to the primary outcome, no association was found between PIS or ONSD and serum albumin level. Concerning sec- ondary outcomes, there was no association between serum albumin level and systolic dysfunction or increased LVEDP. Admission BNP levels were associated with an ultrasound diagnosis of systolic dysfunction (P = .0009), diastolic dys- function (P = .003), and increased LVEDP (P = .007). At a clinically relevant BNP threshold of 200 pg/mL, which is reported as the upper range during normal pregnancy and gestational hypertension, 32,33 post hoc analysis showed that an elevated BNP level was associated with systolic dysfunc- tion (sensitivity and specificity, 50% and 72%, respectively), diastolic dysfunction (sensitivity and specificity, 54% and 84%, respectively), and raised LVEDP (sensitivity and speci- ficity, 57% and 82%, respectively). Relationships Between Cardiac and Lung Ultrasound Findings Further secondary outcomes are shown in Table  4, which describes the relationship of PIS with cardiac function in the cohort. With respect to markers of systolic cardiac function, patients with PIS had a lower mean FS (29.7% vs 33.4%, P = .03) and mean FAC (48.3% vs 52.9%, P = .02) than patients without PIS. There was also a higher mean left ven- tricular diameter end systole (3.2 cm vs 2.9 cm, P < .001) and higher mean left ventricular area end systole (10.4 cm2 vs 8.9 cm2, P = .01) in patients with PIS than in those without the syndrome. Patients with PIS had a higher prevalence of diastolic dysfunction (52% vs 26%, P = .02) than those with- out the condition. The proportion of patients with a raised LVEDP was significantly different in those with and with- out PIS (55% vs 15 %, P = .009).

No association was found between raised ONSD and the presence of PIS (P = .19), systolic dysfunction (P = .24), diastolic dysfunction (P = .40), or raised LVEDP (P = .19). Association of Ultrasound Abnormalities With a Suspicious/Pathological CTG The CTG was normal in 45 (48%), suspicious in 27 (29%), and pathological in 21 (23%) women. In 2 women, CTG was not performed before delivery. There was no association between ultrasound abnormalities and the development of a CTG that was either suspicious or pathological (P = .07). Intra- and interobserver reliabilities were good. With regard to intraobserver reliability, 100% of measurements of the ONSD and the LVEDD and 90% of B-line measure- ments fell within 95% limits of agreement of −3.44 to 3.04, −4.26 to 1.46, and −4.13 to 4.73, respectively. With regard to the interobserver reliability, 100% of the evaluations of the ONSD and the B-lines score and 90% of LVEDD measure- ments fell within 95% limits of agreement of −2.20 to 2.80, −1.93 to 3.13, and −3.80 to 1.20, respectively. A graphical depiction of the limits of agreement of intra- and interob- server variabilities and mean difference (bias) is presented in Supplemental Digital Content 4, Figure 3, http://links. lww.com/AA/C560. DISCUSSION Using several modalities of POCUS examination in women presenting with late-onset preeclampsia with severe fea- tures, we found a high prevalence of PIS, diastolic dys- function, and raised ONSD, with acceptable inter- and intraobserver variability. The serum albumin level was lower in patients with ultrasound abnormalities, but there was no association with PIS or raised ONSD, or with echo- cardiographic markers of systolic dysfunction and raised LVEDP. PIS was associated with several echocardiographic abnormalities, including raised LVEDP. BNP was associated with PIS and echocardiographic abnormalities. There was no association between ultrasound and CTG abnormalities. Lung ultrasound has become a potentially useful tool in the diagnosis of pulmonary disorders. 22 Zieleskiewicz et al 30 detected PIS in 5 of 20 (25%) women presenting with Figure 1. Flow diagram of patient recruitment. Enrollment date March 2016 to July 2016. HIV indicates human immundeficiency virus; ONSD, optic nerve sheath diameter; PIS, pulmonary interstitial syndrome.

Lung ultrasound is a highly sensitive tool to detect accumulation of extravas- cular fluid early in the course of lung injury,34 but it can- not differentiate between a cardiac and noncardiac source of PIS. 35 Pulmonary and cerebral edema in preeclampsia have several contributing factors. These include colloid osmotic pressure, 33 capillary permeability (increased in the presence of a disrupted pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx), and capillary hydrostatic pressure (increased with excessive fluid administration and/or cardiac dysfunction, which is further evidenced by elevated BNP levels). Serum albumin, which is an important main determinant of colloid osmotic pressure, did not correlate with PIS or raised ONSD in our cohort. However, the mean serum albumin concentration of 32.3 g/L (4.1 g/L) in our cohort was higher than the con- centration of 24 g/L (1.0 g/L) reported by Seong et al, 11 who studied early- and late-onset preeclampsia. These authors further found a threshold for serum albumin of 30 g/L, below which pulmonary edema was more likely. The higher serum albumin levels in our cohort may explain the lack of association with PIS. Using echocardiographic measures as surrogate mark- ers for diastolic dysfunction, Zieleskiewicz et al 30 found that a positive B-line pattern correlated with decreased lateral E′ wave velocity and an increased E/E′ ratio. Performing a cardiac and lung ultrasound in 21 preeclamptic women and 12 healthy controls, Ambrozic et al 5 measured higher mean E/E′ values in women with preeclampsia, but did not find Table 1.

Using a comparable echocardiographic approach, we could confirm an association between diastolic dysfunction and the presence of PIS. In our cohort, there was a similar association between PIS and raised LVEDP on ultrasound to that found by Zieleskiewicz et al. 30 Further exploratory analysis of our data indicates that the absence of PIS on lung ultrasound has a high negative predictive value for a raised LVEDP on cardiac ultrasound. Given that lung ultrasound is a simple technique to learn, 36 this might be of value to the clinician. Based on measurements of FS and FAC, systolic func- tion was preserved in most women in our cohort, and systolic dysfunction was present in a similar small subset as described in other comprehensive TTE investigations in preeclampsia.33,34 We found a significant association between reduced FS, FAC, raised LVEDP, and a B-pattern on lung ultrasound, indicating that reduced contractile func- tion and cardiac reserve may be an important factor in the generation of PIS. An additional indication of validity of our cardiac ultrasound findings is the significant association found between raised BNP levels and echocardiographic markers of impaired systolic and diastolic function. The mean BNP level of 234 pg/mL in our study is comparable with the value of 254 pg/mL described in late-onset preeclampsia by Rafik Hamad et al. 15 In our patient cohort, BNP showed high specificity but only moderate sensitivity in the prediction of ultrasound abnormalities. Overall, our results suggest that in late-onset preeclampsia, colloid osmotic pressure may be of lesser importance than cardiac dysfunction as a contrib- uting factor to the development of PIS. A reduced serum albumin level may also contribute to cerebral edema in critical illness and preeclampsia.12,37 Assessing ONSD as a surrogate marker for cerebral edema,38 Dubost et al 9 found ONSD to be increased in 5 of 26 (19%) preeclamptic women and measured a median ONSD of 5.4 mm in their preeclamptic cohort.

June 2019 • Volume 128 • Number 6 www.anesthesia-analgesia.org 1215 to measure ONSD and to define increased ICP, we found a similar mean ONSD of 5.4 mm and a prevalence of 28% of values compatible with increased ICP. No association was observed between increased ONSD and any clinical symp- tom on admission, cardiopulmonary parameter on ultra- sound, or laboratory biomarker. Further work is required to explore the association between increased ONSD and eclamptic seizures and/or cerebrovascular complications. Although there was no association between ultrasound and CTG abnormalities in these patients with late-onset dis- ease, the clinical importance of POCUS in the identification of abnormalities in women with early-onset disease (<34 weeks gestation), where expectant management is usually attempted, remains to be investigated. There are some limitations to our study. Only patients with late-onset disease were studied. Early-onset disease seems to be associated with greater cardiac impairment, 39 and in the setting of expectant management, a POCUS exam- ination could be of greater clinical importance in the predic- tion of the progression of disease severity. We did not include healthy controls in our study. However, a recent lung ultra- sound investigation in 150 healthy parturients at >36 weeks gestation found no B-patterns. 40 Furthermore, no B-patterns have been identified in previous investigations applying lung ultrasound in control cases in preeclampsia stud- ies. 5,30 With regard to ONSD, Dubost et al 9 could not detect increased ONSD in any healthy control, and they reported a 95% CI for ONSD in healthy controls of 4.3–4.8 mm, 9 which is significantly below the cutoff point of 5.8 mm used in both the study of Dubost et al 9 and our own. The optimal ONSD cutoff value to define increased ICP remains controversial. 41 Beyond our prespecified primary analysis, we conducted several additional analyses based on strong biological plau- sibility; however, we have applied a statistical correction for multiple comparisons. Nevertheless, we concede that the results of our secondary analyses are exploratory and hypothesis generating. Last, results from ultrasound studies may be biased based on inter- and intraobserver differences. Therefore, reliability testing was performed, which resulted in clinically insignificant mean differences (biases) in this study for both intra- and interobserver tests. In conclusion, this study revealed a high prevalence of ultrasound abnormalities in women presenting with late- onset preeclampsia with severe features. The results have shown the value of POCUS examination in elucidating the mechanism of PIS in these patients. There was no associa- tion with serum albumin levels, but abnormalities of car- diac function were associated with PIS, and may be more important than hypoalbuminemia in the generation of PIS in late-onset preeclampsia. The absence of PIS may exclude raised LVEDP. The further clinical relevance of PIS and raised ONSD remains to be established. BNP was associated with cardiopulmonary ultrasound abnormalities on admis- sion. Although this study was not designed to directly influ- ence clinical management, the findings suggest that POCUS may serve as a useful adjunct to clinical examination for the obstetric anesthesiologist caring for these complex patients. Further investigations are required in patients with early- onset preeclampsia, to establish both the prevalence of ultrasound abnormalities and their value in the prediction of maternal complications and delivery outcomes.
