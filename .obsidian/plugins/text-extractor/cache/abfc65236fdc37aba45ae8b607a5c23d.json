Coagulation studies Elevated aPTT requires investigation for the presence of lupus anticoagulant. AntidsDNA, complement levels May refiect lupus activity after comparison with previous baseline measurements. Urinalysis Proteinuria, red cells, white cells, and cellular casts may indicate clinically silent disease and prompt further investigation. Electrocardiogram Silent ischemia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and conduction abnomalities may be identified.
