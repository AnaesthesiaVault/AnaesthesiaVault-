Findings on initial studies \" Obtain ECG. Look for signs of ACS; extension of type A dissection to coronary ostia can cause coronary schermia (nght coronary artery most commonly affected). \" Obtain D-dimer, CBC, basic clectrolytes, LDH, cardiac markers, coagulation parameters, and type and crossmatch.

Ifthe systolic blood pressure remains above 120 mmHg, intate nitroprusside infusion (0.25 to 0.5 meg/kg per minut titrated to @ maximum of 10 meg/kg per minute) or nicardipine infusion (5 mg/nour increasing every 5 minutes by 2.5 mg/hourto a maximum of 15 mg/hour).
