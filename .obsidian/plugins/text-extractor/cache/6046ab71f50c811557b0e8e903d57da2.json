{"path":"Images/Pasted image 20240214122254.png","text":"A multicentre randomised controlled trial is currently underway (Optimal Oxygenation in Intensive Care Unit {0,-ICU study). This will randomise critically ill patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to a target p,0, of 60-90mmHg (8-12kPa) vs. 105-135mmHg (14-18kPa). What do we measure? Oxygenation is commonly measured noninvasively by peripheral saturation monitoring (S,0,), which has its limitations. The relationship between S50, and the risk of hyperoxaemia in critically ill patients has been investigated (Durlinger 2016). Evidence suggests that the prevalence of hyperoxaemia >100mmHg (13.3kPa) is negligible provided that the $,0, does not exceed 95%; similarly, p,0, >125mmHg (16.6kPa) did not frequently occur with an 5,0, <96%. However, a recent publication looking at hyperoxaemia in post cardiac arrest {Roberts â€” Circulation 2018) found that $,0; and FO; levels could not reliably rule out exposure to hyperoxaemia and recommend that frequent arterial blood gases are performed to ensure that hyperoxaemia does not happen.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
