Possible pneumocephalus * Cervical spine injury. Avoid excessive neck flexion / extension PNS Peripheral nerve injuries may occur in any position and are thought to be the end result of nerve ischaemia from undue stretching or direct pressure. In patients at risk * Diabetes e Peripheral vascular disease * Alcohol dependency * Pre-existing neuropathy * Anatomical variants * Previous post-operative neurological problems It may be prudent to assess them in the proposed operative position while awake. The recommendation is that arms should be next to the side rather than abducted. Pressure injuries May be direct or indirect (when injury occurs as a result of pressure on, or occlusion of, vascular supply). * Direct o Pressure necrosis of skin. Face, breasts, ears, genitalia, iliac crests o Contact dermatitis o Tracheal compression. Only reported in patients with underlying anatomical abnormalities o Salivary gland swelling. Postulated to result from stretching of salivary ducts, leading to stasis and acute swelling o Shoulder dislocation. Distribution of pressure may lead to anterior dislocation of the shoulder.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
