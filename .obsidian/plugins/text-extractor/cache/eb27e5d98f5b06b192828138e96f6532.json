Significant coronary artery disease, heart failure and ejection fraction <40% are comorbidities that increase surgical mortality.'? Lung function tests Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV3) expected to be <45% of predicted DLco, expected to be between 20% and 40% of predicted. Patients will often have a residual volume >150% of predicted. Total lung capacity is often >100% predicted. A marked abnormality of alveolar gas exchange (DLp<20%) or a FEV; <20% of predicted are contraindications for LVRS. High resolution CT of chest To identify if the lungs are suitable for surgery (i.e. a heterogeneous distribution of emphysema in â€˜which there are areas of relatively normal lung tissue). Homogenous distribution of emphysema without areas of preserved lung, presence of large bullae, interstitial lung disease and nodules are contraindications to LVRS. Cardiopulmonary exercise To determine cardiopulmonary functional status and to assess potential operative risk. testing To quantify and monitor clinical response to surgery. A pharmacological stress test is advisable if an exercise test cannot be performed. Shuttle walk test A distance of 150 m is an accepted minimum requirement post pulmonary rehabilitation.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
