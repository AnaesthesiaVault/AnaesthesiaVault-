There is some variation between institutions regarding dose and timing of octreotide administration. What is commonly accepted, however, is that octreotide therapy needs to be commenced prior to surgery and continued throughout the procedure with supplemental dosing based on clinical response. The half-life of octreotide is 60-90 min and can be administered subcutaneously or intravenously.2? Some authors have recommended the preoperative subcutaneous administration of 100 pg of octreotide and another 100 pg administered intravenously just before induction of anaesthesia. An intravenous octreotide infusion at the rate of 50-100 pg.h! can be administered during surgery.2* Another regimen suggests a continuous infusion of 50 pug.hâ„¢ for 12 hours prior to surgery to reduce hormonal activity with supplemental doses on an ad hoc basis.Z It should be noted that octreotide has widespread effects, important among these are QT prolongation, bradycardia, conduction defects, abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
