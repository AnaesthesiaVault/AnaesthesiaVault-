VASOACTIVE MEDICATIONS 1.We recommend norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 92.We suggest adding either vasopressin (up to 0.03 U/min) (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) or epinephrine (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence) to norepinephrine with the intent of raising mean arterial pressure to target, or adding vasopressin (up to 0.03 U/min) (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) to decrease norepinephrine dosage. 3. We suggest using dopamine as an altemative vasopressor agent to norepinephrine only in highly selected patients (e.g, patients with low risk of tachyarrhythmias and absolute or relative bradycardia) (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). 4. We recommend against using low-dose dopamine for renal protection (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). 5. We suggest using dobutamine in patients who show evidence of persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid loading and the use of vasopressor agents (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
