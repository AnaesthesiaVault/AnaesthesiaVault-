Concentric LVH = increased LVEDP -> decreased coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) = reduced DO2 CPP = diastolic aortic pressure â€” LVEDP 23 As the AS worsens, decreased diastolic aortic pressure = ever-lower CPP 3. LVH-> decreased LV compliance and higher LV filling pressures = diastolic dysfunction = impaired cardiac filling. 4. Neovascularization of the pressure-overloaded heart is inadequate for the degree of hypertrophy. 5 The isovolumic phase of relaxation is inappropriately long, shortening the filling period of diastole, which diminishes the time for coronary perfusion.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
