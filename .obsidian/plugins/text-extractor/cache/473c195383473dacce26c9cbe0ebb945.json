[Please note, this is not to say that DO, is not improved with supplemental oxygen in_hypoxaemic patients, rather that hyperoxaemia does not improve DO,]. Clinicians seem reassured by a high p,0; as they think it reflects a margin of safety, when in fact, we could be causing harm, especially when the safety margin tips into hyperoxaemia. Normobaric hyperoxia is associated with a reduction in capillary perfusion, it is postulated that vasoconstriction accurs to protect the cells from the harmful effects of a high arterial partial pressure of oxygen in the blaod {p,0s). The vasoconstriction caused by hyperoxia leads to a paradoxical decrease in oxygen delivery which Is seen within minutes. In medicine, inadvertent hyperoxaemia is very common, yet there is Increasing evidence that it is harmful. How much is too much? What constitutes harmul oxygen therapy is still debated, mild hyperoxaemia impacts adversely, and the risk of death Increases linearly with prolonged exposure; cumulative exposure may be harmful (and it certainly isn't benign). Certain subgroups of the population may be more at risk than others There are 2 parameters of interest: 1. Duration of hyperoxia and 2. Degree of hyperoxia 1. Arandomised controlled trial {Page - 2018) in patients admitted to the emergency department (ED} tried to answer the question \"is a brief exposure to hyperoxia, in critically il patients harmful2” The cohort was categorised into 3 groups of oxygen exposure after intubation in the ED: hypoxaemia (p,0, <60mmHg / <8kPa), normoxaemia {p,0; 60-120mmHg / 8-16kPa) and hyperoxaemia (p,0, >120mmHg / >16kPa), all groups were normoxaemic on day 1 of ICU admission. This study found that oxygen was liverally used in the ED (median /0, 70%) and a pre-ICU hyperoxaemia rate of 43.6%. The ED LOS was 5.4 hours {3.5-7.9) and the APACHE I score was greatest in the hypoxaemia group. Even after controlling for confounders such as lung-protective ventilation, hyperoxaemia remained an independent predictor of hospital mortality in multivariate analysis. Hospital mortality worsened across the hyperoxaemia subgroups: Hospital mortality was 13.2% in the hypoxaemic group, 19.4% in the normoxaemic group, and 29.7% in the hyperoxaemia group. Hyperoxaemia in the emergency department was an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted OR 1.95 (1.24-2.85)). It has been postulated that cumulative exposure is more harmful, but this study shows that brief periads of hypoxaemia are associated with adverse events. Although this was a study in critically il patients, perhaps the findings can be extrapolated to anaesthesia ~ food for thought for the longer cases when the p,0 is >120mmHg / >16kPa 2. In both ICU and under anaesthesia, the literature supports the reluctance of clinicians to reduce the fraction of inspired oxygen (F,05) to less than 0.4, when the peripheral oxygen saturation (5,0;) or p,0; are supranormal, The use of a minimal FO; of 0.4 is ingrained in medicine, and probably has arisen because this is the most commonly used concentration of oxygen administered by a Venturi mask is 40%. There is no evidence to support this, and there is a call for personalised oxygen therapy. Hypoxaemic patients need supplemental oxygen, this is not an ared for debate, $,0, <90% or p,0, <8kPa (<60mmHg) may predispose to death, but patients must be assessed regularly to limit the risks of hyperoxia. The optimal p,0; has not yet been established, but recommendations are emerging to not exceed an $,0; of 95-95%. Certainly, there is no need for supplemental oxygen if the p,0, >100mmHg (13.3kPa) or the 5,0, is >97%. In the critically il there is a U-shaped association between p,0, and outcome (See Figure 1).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
