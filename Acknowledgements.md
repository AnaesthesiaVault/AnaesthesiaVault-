I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the individuals who have contributed to the creation of this website.

A special thanks to **Dr. Michael Breedt**, who authored the majority of Domain 07: Paediatrics and Domain 06: ENT. Your expertise and hard work have been invaluable.

I would also like to acknowledge the contributors whose resources helped shape the content:

- **Dr. Claire Pfister**, **Dr. Ameen Allie**, and **Dr. Jessica Purcell-Jones** for their excellent Anki card summaries.
- **Dr. Kim Morgan** for the mindmaps added to the notes, enhancing clarity and understanding.

Additionally, I would like to recognize the following websites, which provided inspiration through their concise and well-organized content:

- [FRCAMindmaps](https://www.frcamindmaps.org/)
- [Anaesthesia Considerations](https://www.anesthesiaconsiderations.com/)

These resources have significantly influenced my approach to summarizing and structuring information. Your contributions and insights have greatly enriched this project, and I am deeply grateful for your support.
