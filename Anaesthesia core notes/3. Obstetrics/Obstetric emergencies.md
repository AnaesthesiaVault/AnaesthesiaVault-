# Obstetric Trauma
## Introduction
- Any woman of childbearing age presenting with trauma should be considered pregnant until ruled out by blood test or ultrasound.
- In South Africa, 4% of female trauma patients were pregnant; 57% blunt, 21% penetrating, and 12% burns. Intentional trauma accounted for 52%; road traffic accidents for 26%.
- Surgery was needed in 12% of cases, with 80% resulting in fetal losses.
- One-third of trauma cases were associated with fetal demise, predominantly with high injury severity scores.

## Physiological and Anatomical Considerations
### Airway
- Eight times more likely to be difficult compared to non-pregnant counterparts.

### Respiratory
- Increased oxygen demand and decreased reserves make pregnant patients less tolerant of apnoea or hypoventilation.
- Supplemental oxygen is recommended to maintain arterial oxygenation above 95%.
- Diaphragm displacement necessitates intercostal drain placement in the 4th or 5th intercostal spaces, ideally under ultrasound guidance.

### Gastrointestinal (GIT)
- Consider aspiration risk above 16 weeks.

### Cardiovascular (CVS)
- Significant blood loss can occur before haemodynamic decompensation due to increased blood volume.
- After 20 weeks, aortocaval compression can occur in the supine position; use a left-lateral tilt or manual uterine displacement.
- Correct hypotension urgently as fetal distress is an early marker of hypovolemic shock.
- Place two large bore IV cannulas above the diaphragm; use vasopressors only if volume resuscitation fails.

### Haematological
- Dilutional anaemia and hypercoagulable state are common.

## Radiological Considerations
- Radiographical investigations should not be delayed if indicated for maternal evaluation.
- The highest fetal risk period is between the 2nd and 7th week of gestation.
- Ultrasound is useful for fetal evaluation and focused abdominal scans (FAST) for maternal bleeding.

## Fetal Monitoring
- Monitor all trauma patients with a viable fetus using CTG for at least 4-6 hours.
- Continue monitoring longer if contractions, uterine irritability, vaginal bleeding, membrane rupture, or non-reassuring patterns on the non-stress test occur, or if significant maternal trauma is present.
- Defer speculum and digital examination in active vaginal bleeding until placenta praevia is ruled out.

## Foeto-Maternal Hemorrhage
- Blunt abdominal trauma can cause foeto-maternal hemorrhage, leading to allo-immunisation or severe fetal anemia.

### Allo-immunisation
- As little as 0.1 ml of fetal blood can cause allo-immunisation in Rh(D)-negative patients.
- Administer anti-D immunoglobulin within 72 hours of abdominal trauma.
- Use the Kleihauer-Betke test to quantify fetal blood in maternal circulation and adjust the Rh-immune globulin dose accordingly.

### Fetal Anemia
- Some guidelines recommend Kleihauer-Betke testing for all pregnant trauma patients >12 weeks, others only for symptomatic patients >20 weeks.

## Blood Transfusion and Cell Saver
- Concerns exist about iatrogenic amniotic fluid embolism and DIC with blood potentially contaminated with amniotic fluid.
- Modern cell salvage filters can significantly reduce TF; precautions include discarding blood collected before delivery and using leucocyte depletion filters.
- Minimize transfusions to avoid alloimmunisation and subsequent hemolytic disease. Use O-negative blood if crossmatched blood is unavailable.
- Maintain fibrinogen levels above 2 g/L.

## Ethical Issues
### Informed Consent
- Inform pregnant trauma patients about the risks associated with anaesthesia, radiographic investigations, and blood transfusions.

### Brain-dead Patient with Alive Fetus
- Managing brain-dead pregnant patients poses ethical dilemmas. Prolonged life support can lead to complications; management should be multidisciplinary and follow organ donor care principles. Delivery is usually via Caesarean section after fetal maturity.

# Breech Presentation

### Considerations
- Increased maternal risks: mortality, morbidity, infection, perineal trauma, hemorrhage.
- Increased fetal risks: preterm delivery, birth trauma, congenital anomalies, umbilical cord prolapse, head hyperextension, spinal injuries, asphyxia, intrapartum death.
- External cephalic version considerations.
- Recommended delivery mode: cesarean section. Vaginal delivery may be attempted with pre-planning (Canadian guidelines 2009).

### Management
- **Analgesia for Labor**:
  - Early epidural if possible.
  - Avoid pushing in 1st stage to prevent fetal head entrapment.
- **Anesthesia for Vaginal Breech Delivery**:
  - Prefer delivery in the OR; be ready to convert to GA.
  - Epidural strongly recommended.
  - High risks include umbilical cord compression, fetal head entrapment.
- **Anesthesia for Cesarean Delivery**:
  - Neuraxial or GA.
  - Possible need for uterine relaxation; have nitroglycerin available.
  - May require larger or vertical incision.
- **Fetal Head Entrapment**:
  - Nitroglycerin IV 100-400 mcg or SL 400-800 mcg.
  - Likely need STAT GA: RSI (propofol/succinylcholine) and start 2-3 MAC of volatile for uterine relaxation.
  - Support hemodynamics and control hemorrhage.

# Category 1 Cesarean Section (C/S)
- Defined as immediate threat to the life of the woman or fetus.
- A decision-to-delivery interval of 30 min is used as an audit tool to test delivery suite efficiency, not as a benchmark for individual cases.

### Interventions Prior to Theatre
- Position mother in recumbent left lateral position.
- Administer high-inspired percentage maternal oxygen.
- Rapid infusion of non-glucose-based crystalloids.
- Stop oxytocin infusions or inhibit contractions (e.g., terbutaline 250 mg SC).
- These measures may improve CTG and downgrade the C/S from Category 1 to 2.

### Technique
- **Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI)**.
- **Rapid Sequence Spinal Anaesthesia**:
  - Use a ‘no-touch’ technique with sterile gloves.
  - Utilize staff for IV cannulation, limit attempts to one.
  - Prepare for GA during spinal insertion; concerns exist about aseptic technique.

# Uterine Inversion

### Considerations
- Emergency situation.
- Postpartum hemorrhage requiring massive transfusion.
- Facilitate uterine reduction with tocolytics (nitroglycerin, volatile anesthetics).
- Treat uterine atony after reduction (medical and surgical).

### Goals and Conflicts
- RSI in hypovolemic shock.
- Safely manage airway, avoiding aspiration and hypoxemia.
- Aggressive fluid resuscitation.
- Close communication with obstetrician during tocolytic therapy titration.

### Management
- Confirm diagnosis: postpartum hemorrhage, hypovolemic shock, mass in introitus/vagina.
- Mobilize resources, call obstetrician STAT, establish management plan:
  - To OR for definitive treatment.
  - Assemble skilled help.
  - Notify blood bank, prepare for massive transfusion.
- Begin fluid resuscitation, large bore IV access, rapid transfuser, blood products to OR.
- **Tocolytic Therapy**:
  - Nitroglycerin 100-400 mcg IV boluses (chase with phenylephrine boluses).
  - Volatile anesthesia following RSI (low dose or no ketamine).
- **Followed by Uterotonic Therapy**:
  - Oxytocin 40 units per 1 L crystalloid or duratocin 100 mcg IV slow push.
  - Ergonovine 0.2 mg IM & 0.2 mg IV slow push.
  - Carboprost (hemabate) 0.25 mg IM or intramyometrial.
  - Misoprostol 800-1200 mcg rectal.
