- ST depression (1 mm) in left precordial and limb leads.
- Isoelectric T-waves in left precordial and limb leads.

- Left-sided chambers increase in size by 10%-12%.
- Left ventricular eccentric hypertrophy.
- Increased ejection fraction.
- Increased mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonic valve annuli.
- Aortic annulus not dilated.

- Occasional mitral regurgitation (27%).
- Small, insignificant pericardial effusions may be present.

### Aortocaval Compression
- **Supine Hypotension Syndrome**: Experienced by 8%-10% of women. Defined as a decrease in mean arterial pressure >15 mm Hg with an increase in heart rate >20 bpm, often associated with diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and changes in mentation.
- **Compression**: Significant aortoiliac artery compression occurs in 15%-20% of pregnant women.

### Blood Volume Changes
- At term, blood volume has increased by 1000 to 1500 mL, allowing most women to tolerate the blood loss associated with delivery (vaginal delivery: 200-500 mL, cesarean section: 800-1000 mL).
- Total blood volume reaches 90 mL/kg.

## Respiratory Changes
- **Minute Ventilation**: Increased 45%-50%.
  - **Respiratory Rate**: Increased 0%-15%.
  - **Tidal Volume**: Increased 40%-45%.
- **Lung Volumes**:
  - **Inspiratory Reserve Volume**: Increased 0%-5%.
  - **Tidal Volume**: Increased 40%-45%.
  - **Expiratory Reserve Volume**: Decreased 20%-25%.
  - **Residual Volume**: Decreased 15%-20%.
- **Lung Capacities**:
  - **Vital Capacity**: No change.
  - **Inspiratory Capacity**: Increased 5%-15%.
  - **Functional Residual Capacity**: Decreased 20%.
  - **Total Lung Capacity**: Decreased 0%-5%.
- **Oxygen Consumption**:
  - **Term**: Increased 20%-35%.
  - **Labor (First Stage)**: Increased 40% above prelabor value.
  - **Labor (Second Stage)**: Increased 75% above prelabor value.
- **Respiratory Measures**:
  - **FEV1**: No change.
  - **FEV1/FVC**: No change.
  - **Closing Capacity**: No change.
- **Arterial Blood Gas**:
  - **Pregnancy**: PaCO2 30, PaO2 103, HCO3 20, pH 7.44.
  - **Non-Pregnant**: PaCO2 40, PaO2 100, HCO3 24, pH 7.4.
- **Oxy-Haem Dissociation Curve**:
  - Shifts to the right, with P50 increasing from 27 to 30 mm Hg at term.
  - Increased 2,3-DPG to offset hyperventilation effects.
  - Net: Right shift for more oxygen delivery.
- **Decreased Physiological Dead Space**: Narrowed PaCO2/PACO2 gradient. Closing volume can exceed FRC, leading to rapid desaturation.

## Airway Changes
- Capillary engorgement increases risk for trauma and bleeding.
- Enlarged breast size can complicate laryngoscopy.

## Neurological Changes
- **MAC**: Decreased 40% due to progesterone effects and beta-endorphin levels (sedative effect).
- **Local Anaesthetics**: Decrease dose by 30%. Hormonal effects and engorgement of the epidural venous plexus lead to decreased spinal cerebrospinal fluid volume, decreased epidural space volume, and increased epidural pressure.

## Renal Changes
- **GFR**: Increased 50%.
- Decreased creatinine and urea.
- Mild glycosuria (1–10 g/d) or proteinuria (<300 mg/d).
- Plasma osmolality decreases by 8 to 10 mOsm/kg.

## Coagulation Changes
- **Platelet Count**: Decreased 10%-20%.
- **Hemoglobin**: Decreased 20%, usually remains >11 g/dL.
- **White Cell Count**: Increased up to 21,000.
- **Pro-Coagulant Factors**:
  - **Increased**: I, VII, VIII, IX, X, XII, von Willebrand factor.
  - **Decreased**: XI, XIII.
  - **Unchanged**: II, V.
- **Anti-Coagulant Factors**:
  - **Increased**: None.
  - **Decreased**: Antithrombin III, Protein S.
  - **Unchanged**: Protein C.

## Gastrointestinal Changes
- Increased gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis.
- Reduced gastric motility and incompetence of gastroesophageal sphincter due to uterine displacement.
- 30%-60% of pregnant patients have a gastric volume >25 mL or gastric fluid pH <2.5.
- High risk for regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.

## Hepatic Changes
- Decreased pseudocholinesterase by 30%.
- High progesterone levels inhibit cholecystokinin release, leading to incomplete gallbladder emptying and gallstones.
- Minor elevations in AST, ALT, ALP, and LDH.
- Plasma protein concentrations decrease: 25% decrease in albumin, 10% decrease in total protein at term.
- Colloid osmotic pressure decreases from 27 to 22 mmHg during gestation.

## Metabolic Changes
- Diabetogenic state with increased insulin levels due to human placental lactogen leading to insulin resistance.
- Pancreatic beta cell hyperplasia in response to increased insulin demand.
- Elevated levels of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) due to increased thyroid-binding globulin; free T4, free T3, and TSH remain normal.
- Serum calcium levels decrease, but ionized calcium concentration remains normal.

## Musculoskeletal Changes
- Increased relaxin leading to backache.

## Endocrine Changes
- **Placenta Produces**:
  - Progesterone
  - Estrogen
  - Prostaglandins
  - Human placental lactogen (HPL)
  - Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)
- **Pituitary**:
  - Increased ACTH and prolactin.
- **RAAS Stimulation**:
  - Directly by estrogen.
  - Indirectly by progesterone's natriuretic effect reducing sodium and stimulating RAAS.
- **Adrenals**:
  - Increased cortisol.
- **Thyroid**:
  - Increased T3, T4, and thyroxine-binding globulin; normal unbound levels.
- **Pancreas**:
  - Increased insulin secretion with reduced tissue sensitivity, leading to more glucose availability for the fetus.

## Delivery
- Minute ventilation may increase up to 300%.
- Oxygen consumption increases by an additional 60% above third-trimester values.
- Excessive hyperventilation can cause PaCO2 to decrease below 20 mm Hg.
  - Marked hypocapnia can lead to hypoventilation and transient maternal and fetal hypoxemia between contractions.
  - Excessive hyperventilation reduces uterine blood flow and promotes fetal acidosis.
- Each contraction displaces 300-500 mL of blood from the uterus into the central circulation, increasing cardiac output by 45% over third-trimester values.
- The greatest cardiac strain occurs immediately after delivery, with cardiac output increasing up to 80% above late third-trimester values.

## Return to Normal
- **FRC**: Returns to normal within 48 hours after delivery.
- **Blood Volume**: Normalizes within 1-2 weeks.
- **Pseudocholinesterase Levels**: Return to normal within 6 weeks.
- **MAC**: Returns to normal by 72 hours postpartum.
- **Dosage Requirements for Regional Anesthesia**: Return to normal within 24-36 hours.
- **Gastric Volume and Fluid pH**: Normalize within 24 hours after delivery.
- Some physiological changes may take up to 6 weeks for resolution.
- **

Cardiac Output**: Decreases substantially toward prepregnant values by 2 weeks postpartum, with complete return to nonpregnant levels between 12 and 24 weeks postpartum.
