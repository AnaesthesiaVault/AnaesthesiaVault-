# Labor Analgesia

## Pre-operative Assessment

- **Review:**
	- Obstetric history, medical history, and past anesthetic history
- **Focused Physical Examination:**
	- Vitals, cardiovascular system (CVS), respiratory system, airway, and back
- **Review Relevant Lab Tests:**
	- Routine platelet count not necessary
	- Radiological studies
- **Assessment of Fetal Well-being:**
	- Collaboration with obstetrician
- **Ascertain Availability & Competence:**
	- Attending nursing staff
- **Check Routine and Emergency Resuscitation Equipment:**
- **Informed Consent Must Include:**
	- Procedure(s), impact on labor and delivery, risks and benefits, financial implications

## Distribution of Pain

### First Stage

- **Pain Type:** Visceral pain from uterine contractions and cervical dilation
- **Dermatomes:** T11-T12 (latent), T10-L1 (active)
- **Pathway:**
	- Visceral afferent fibers travel with sympathetic nerve fibers to the uterovaginal plexus, through the inferior hypogastric plexus, entering the spinal cord via T10-L1 nerve roots
	- Pain initially perceived in the lower abdomen, may refer to lumbosacral area, gluteal region, and thighs as labor progresses

### Second Stage

- **Pain Type:** Onset of perineal pain
- **Nerve Involvement:** Pudendal nerve (S2-S4)
- **Dermatomes:** T10-S4

## Analgesia

### Non-pharmacological

- Patient education and conditioning (Lamaze)
- Hypnosis, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), biofeedback, and acupuncture

### Pharmacological

#### Pethidine

- **Dosage:** 10-25 mg IVI or 25-50 mg IMI (Max 100 mg)
- **Onset/Duration:** Maximal respiratory depression in 10-20 min (IVI) and 1-3 hours (IMI)
- **Note:** Do not administer if delivery is not within 4 hours

#### Fentanyl

- **Dosage:** 25 to 100 mcg/h
- **Onset/Duration:** Onset 3-10 min, lasts 60 min
- **Effects:** Lower doses associated with minimal neonatal respiratory depression; primarily acts at spinal level
- **Potency Ratio:** Sufentanil to fentanyl is approximately 6:1

#### Remifentanil

- **Administration:** Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) setting with a 40-mcg bolus and a 2-minute lockout

#### Antihistamines

- **Medications:** Promethazine (25-50 mg IM), Hydroxyzine (50-100 mg IM)
- **Benefits:** Reduce anxiety, opioid requirements, incidence of nausea without significantly adding to neonatal depression

#### NSAIDs

- **Effect:** Suppress uterine contractions and promote closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus

#### Midazolam

- **Dosage:** Up to 2 mg
- **Combination:** Can be combined with fentanyl (100 mcg) to enhance the analgesic effect of neuraxial blockade

#### Ketamine

- **Dosage:** 10-15 mg IVI
- **Onset:** 2-5 min
- **Note:** Large boluses (>1 mg/kg) can cause hypertonic uterine contractions; useful just before delivery or as an adjuvant to regional anesthesia

#### Nitrous Oxide (N2O)

## Regional Analgesia for Labor

- **Cesarean Section (CS):** Requires dermatomes up to and including T4 to be anesthetized

### Advantages of Regional Anesthesia

1. **Neonatal Benefits:**
	- Less exposure to potentially depressant drugs
	- Better acid-base status compared to systemic opiates
	- Less respiratory assistance after birth
2. **Maternal Benefits:**
	- Decreased risk of pulmonary aspiration
	- Awake mother, experiencing the birth
	- Lower paternal anxiety, greater involvement and satisfaction
	- Use of spinal opioids for postoperative pain relief
	- Lower plasma catecholamines, potentially improving uteroplacental perfusion and uterine activity
	- Rapid establishment of epidural anesthesia for emergency CS
	- Safer than emergency GA for CS

### Spinal/Epidural Techniques

- **Vasopressor Administration:** Early use favored over large volume IV fluids
- **Fluid Delivery:**
	- Crystalloid coload preferred over preload
	- Colloid preload more effective than crystalloid preload or coload

#### Opioid Only Technique

- **High-Risk Patients:** Suitable for those who may not tolerate functional sympathectomy
- **Combinations:** Morphine 0.1-0.25 mg + fentanyl 12.5 mcg (or sufentanil 5 mcg) for rapid onset analgesia
- **Epidural Doses:**
	- Fentanyl 50-150 mcg or sufentanil 10-20 mcg (onset 5-10 min, duration 1-2 hours)
	- Lower dose morphine 2.5 mg + fentanyl 25-50 mcg (or sufentanil 7.5-10 mcg) for prolonged analgesia (4-5 hours)
- **Techniques:**
	- Programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB)
	- Continuous epidural analgesia

## Epidural Anesthesia

### Informed Consent

- Includes procedure, impact on labor and delivery, risks, benefits, financial implications

### Technical Aspects

- Epidural analgesia does not increase operative delivery rate or affect labor progress significantly with dilute mixtures
- **Loss of Resistance:** Limit air injection to <2-3 mL to avoid patchy/unilateral analgesia and headache
- **Epidural Depth:** Average 6 cm from skin in obstetric patients
- **Optimal Insertion Site:** L3-4 or L4-5 interspace for T10-S5 neural blockade
- **Dural Puncture Options:**
	- Continuous spinal analgesia
	- Re-attempt at another level
- **Multiorifice Catheter:** Reduces unilateral blocks, false-negative aspiration rates

## Drugs Used for Initiation of Epidural and Spinal Labor Analgesia

### Local Anesthetics

#### Epidural Analgesia

- Bupivacaine: 0.0625% - 0.125%
- Ropivacaine: 0.08% - 0.2%
- Levobupivacaine: 0.0625% - 0.125%

#### Spinal Analgesia

- Bupivacaine: 1.25 - 2.5 mg
- Ropivacaine: 2.0 - 3.5 mg
- Levobupivacaine: 2.0 - 3.5 mg

### Opioids

#### Epidural Analgesia

- Fentanyl: 50 - 100 mcg
- Sufentanil: 5 - 10 mcg

#### Spinal Analgesia

- Fentanyl: 15 - 25 mcg
- Sufentanil: 1.5 - 5 mcg

## Anesthetic Solutions Used for Maintenance of Epidural Analgesia: Continuous Infusion or PCEA

### Local Anesthetics

- Bupivacaine: 0.05 - 0.125%
- Ropivacaine: 0.08 - 0.2%
- Levobupivacaine: 0.05 - 0.125%

### Opioids

- Fentanyl: 1.5 - 3 mcg/mL
- Sufentanil: 0.2 - 0.4 mcg/mL
## Administration Techniques

### 1) Intermittent Bolus (Manual Top-Ups)
- **Description:** The first method used to maintain epidural analgesia, preceding the development of infusion pumps.
- **Disadvantages:** Regression of pain relief triggers further top-ups; severe pain may occur if there are delays in drug administration.

### 2) Continuous Epidural Infusion (CEI)
- **Description:** Popular technique in busy labor wards; lengthens time between bolus rescue injections, increasing patient satisfaction.
- **Advantages:** Greater patient satisfaction, reasonable perineal analgesia over time.
- **Disadvantages:** Larger total dose of local anesthetic (LA) than intermittent bolus; potential for significant motor block unless very low LA concentrations are used.

### 3) Patient-Controlled Epidural Analgesia (PCEA)
- **Description:** Allows patients to administer intermittent boluses of epidural maintenance solution, accommodating escalating analgesic requirements.
- **Advantages:** Reduces total LA volume without compromising analgesia quality, lower incidence of side effects, higher maternal satisfaction compared to CEI.

### 4) PCEA with Basal Infusion
- **Description:** Combination of PCEA with a continuous basal infusion.
- **Advantages:** Better analgesia and patient satisfaction than PCEA alone; may reduce the incidence of breakthrough pain requiring intervention.
- **Optimal Rates:** High-rate basal infusion (5 mL/hr) more effective than low-rate (4 mL/hr) basal infusion.

### 5) Automated Intermittent Bolus Techniques
- **Description:** Automated systems (e.g., Automated Intermittent Mandatory Boluses (AIMB), Continuous Intermittent Boluses (CIB)) administer epidural boluses at programmable intervals.
- **Advantages:** Longer duration of analgesia, higher maternal satisfaction, less need for rescue boluses, reduced LA consumption compared to CEI.
- **Mechanism:** High-driving pressure for bolus injection results in more uniform epidural space spread; multi-orifice catheters enhance this effect.

### 6) Computer-Integrated PCEA (CIPCEA)
- **Description:** New technique where a PCEA pump automatically adjusts the basal infusion rate based on patient requests.
- **Advantages:** Similar LA consumption compared to demand-only PCEA, lower incidence of breakthrough pain, higher patient satisfaction.

### Note
- No definitive regimen has been shown to be optimal in reducing breakthrough pain or clinically significant outcomes such as instrumental or cesarean delivery.

## Complications

### Hypotension
- **Incidence:** 14% after initiation of analgesia.
- **Management:** IV fluid, positioning, and vasopressors.
- **Note:** No significant difference between low-dose EA and CSE; preload administration is not usually helpful as prophylaxis.

### Pruritus
- **Cause:** Common after neuraxial opioid use, worse with intrathecal than epidural.
- **Management:** Usually self-limiting; can be treated with naloxone, naltrexone, or nalbuphine if required.

### Nausea and Vomiting
- **Cause:** Must exclude neuraxial analgesia-induced hypotension.
- **Incidence:** 1.0% with epidural opioid, 2.4% with intrathecal opioid.
- **Management:** Metoclopramide, droperidol, and ondansetron used prophylactically.

### Fever
- **Incidence:** Some women develop a rise in core temperature within an hour of epidural initiation.
- **Mechanism:** Likely an inflammatory process; often associated with higher rates of cesarean and instrumental vaginal delivery.
- **Concerns:** Maternal inflammation may damage the neonatal brain, increasing risks of seizures, encephalopathy, and cerebral palsy (CP).

### Shivering
- **Incidence:** More common with epidurals.

### Urinary Retention

### Delayed Gastric Emptying
- **Cause:** Can occur with intrathecal or epidural fentanyl or prolonged epidural infusion.

### Recrudescence of Herpes Simplex Virus
- **Unknown:** Whether epidural or intrathecal opioid use increases oral HSV reactivation after vaginal delivery, as seen with cesarean sections.

### Inadequate Analgesia
- **Incidence:** Varies based on definition of failure.
- **Note:** Failure rate lower after CSE than epidural analgesia (10% vs. 14%).
- **Management:** Low-dose single-shot spinal anesthesia for cesarean section (CS) no longer recommended due to high supplementation requirement. Dose should not be reduced in obese parturients.

### IV Injection
- **Incidence:** 1:5000 labor epidurals.
- **Management:** Lipid emulsion included in guidelines for managing local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST).

### Respiratory Depression
- **Cause:** Depends on drug solubility, dose is a major risk determinant.
- **Note:** Previous parenteral opioid administration increases risk.

### Intrathecal Injection (Unintentional Dural Puncture)
- **Incidence:** 1.5%.
- **Management:** Resiting the epidural at another interspace or threading a catheter into the subarachnoid space for continuous spinal analgesia.

### High Block or Total Spinal
- **Incidence:** Between 1:1400 and 1:16,200 attempted labor epidurals.
- **Risk Factors:** Short stature, fast injection speed (in plain solutions), obesity/pregnancy, patient positioning (hyperbaric solutions), pre-existing epidural with recent top-up, epidural catheter in subarachnoid space, subdural injection/catheter.

### Extensive Motor Blockade
- **Cause:** Repeated bolus doses or prolonged LA infusion, more common with adrenaline addition.
- **Management:** Use very dilute LA + opioid solutions to minimize risk.

### Prolonged Block
- **Cause:** Prolonged high-concentration LA with adrenaline infusions; must exclude epidural hematoma and peripheral nerve injury.

### Sensory Changes
- **Cause:** Intrathecal opioid for CSE, no sympathectomy or motor block, may block afferent information from A-delta and C-fibers, causing symptoms like difficulty breathing or swallowing.

### Back Pain
- **Incidence:** No causal relationship with long-term postpartum backache; short-term backache due to needle trauma.

### Pelvic Floor Injury
- **Note:** Epidural analgesia increases risk of instrumental vaginal delivery, but studies do not show increased risk of pelvic floor injury or dysfunction.

### Dural-Puncture Headache
- **Cause:** Decreased intracranial pressure with compensatory cerebral vasodilation.
- **Management:** Bed rest, hydration, oral analgesics, caffeine sodium benzoate (500 mg in 1000 mL IV fluids at 200 mL/hr), IV gabapentin, hydrocortisone, theophylline. Epidural blood patch (10-20 mL) for moderate to severe headaches, delaying blood patch for 24 hours increases efficacy.

### High Spinal
- **Definition:** Sensorimotor block above required surgical anesthesia level (T3 or above).
- **Symptoms:** Significant cardiovascular and respiratory compromise, possible cranial nerve involvement leading to loss of consciousness and cardiorespiratory arrest.
- **Risk Factors:** Short stature, fast injection speed (plain solutions), obesity/pregnancy, positioning, pre-existing epidural with recent top-up, epidural catheter in subarachnoid space, subdural injection/catheter, intradural injection/catheter.

- **Hypotension and bradycardia:** Early signs of high spinal anesthesia
- **Hypotension ± bradycardia:** High spinal anesthesia is likely
- **Hypotension + bradycardia:** High spinal anesthesia is established

##### Management

###### Diagnosis

- **High spinal anesthesia is unlikely:**
	- Reassure the patient and monitor for signs of deterioration
- **Early signs of high spinal anesthesia:**
	- Provide face mask oxygen at 100%
	- Feel the patient’s pulse, and monitor heart rate and blood pressure

###### Call for Help

- **High spinal anesthesia is likely:**
	- Provide gentle positive pressure ventilation with a tight-fitting face mask (100% O2), including cricoid pressure (if this does not impair ventilation). Reassure the patient
	- Bradycardia: Ephedrine 10 mg intravenously, and run colloid freely
	- No bradycardia: Fluid only
	- Monitor the patient closely for deterioration, and titrate vasopressor and fluid
- **High spinal anesthesia is established:**
	- Provide rapid sequence tracheal intubation and ventilation after the administration of a small dose of etomidate or isoflurane if face mask oxygen is being provided, and suxamethonium 1 mg/kg
	- Do not use propofol or thiopentone in this situation
	- Ephedrine 10-20 mg intravenously
	- In the absence of the immediate return of adequate cardiac output, run 500 mL hydroxyethyl starch freely, containing 1 mg adrenaline

### Post-Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH)

#### Background

- **Definition:** Headache occurring within 5 days of a lumbar puncture caused by CSF leakage through the dural puncture. Often accompanied by neck stiffness and/or subjective hearing symptoms. It usually remits spontaneously within 2 weeks or after sealing the leak with a blood patch.
- **Incidence:** Known complication of diagnostic lumbar puncture, spinal anesthesia, or unintentional dural puncture (UDP) during epidural insertion (risk ~1/100 to 1/200).

#### Presentation

- **Onset:** Typically develops 12-48 hours after dural puncture (up to 5 days).
- **Duration:** Usually resolves spontaneously within 1-2 weeks.
- **Characteristics:** Positional headache (worse when upright, better when supine), bilateral, often frontal or occipital.
- **Associated Symptoms:** Neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea, subjective hearing changes (tinnitus, hypoacusia).

#### Pathophysiology

- **Mechanism:** Thought to be due to CSF leakage through the dural hole, causing CSF or intracranial hypotension.

#### Risk Factors

- Female sex, pregnancy, age (18-50), needle type (cutting > pencil point), larger needle size, needle inserted with bevel perpendicular to long axis of spine > parallel, operator inexperience, possibly increased risk if stylet not reinserted before needle withdrawal.

#### Differential Diagnosis

- Important to rule out other more sinister causes of headache.
- **Indications for Urgent Imaging:** CT/MRI, neuro consult if diagnosis is unclear, presence of fever/chills, neurological signs, seizures, decreased level of consciousness (LOC), or if two epidural blood patches (EBPs) are ineffective.

#### Management

##### Conservative

- Daily review until resolution.
- Bed rest for temporary relief.
- Maintain hydration.
- Thromboprophylaxis considering the timing if a blood patch is used.
- Simple analgesia.
- Stronger opioids (<72 hours) can be offered.
- Caffeine (200-300 mg doses, total 900 mg/24 hours) for short-term benefit.
- Stool softeners to avoid straining.

##### Epidural Blood Patch (EBP)

- **Indications:** If conservative measures fail or the headache is debilitating.
- **Effectiveness:** 65-98% effective after one treatment; can repeat if necessary.
- **Contraindications:** Same as those for neuraxial anesthetic techniques.
- **Procedure:**
	- Administer at the level or one level below the previous entry point.
	- Use 20 mL of blood, stopping if discomfort occurs.
	- No need for concomitant antibiotics.
	- Bed rest for 2 hours post-procedure.
	- Ongoing monitoring and review 4 hours after the procedure.

##### Other Options

- Sphenopalatine ganglion or greater occipital nerve block may provide symptomatic relief.

#### Prevention of PDPH

- Insufficient evidence for clear guidance.
- Consider injecting ~10 mL of preservative-free normal saline into the subarachnoid space if UDP occurs.
- Consider placing an intrathecal catheter for 24 hours, ensuring medications are not inadvertently injected into the catheter.

### Spinal Hypotension

#### Definition

- **SBP <90 mmHg** or **MAP reduction of >30% from baseline**.

#### Mechanism

- Decrease in systemic vascular resistance due to arteriolar and venodilatation.
- Net effect: HR and stroke volume maintained or increased, maintaining/increasing cardiac output and venous return.
- Persistent hypotension despite fluid and vasopressor therapy should alert to possible fluid balance misassessment or undiagnosed cardiac disease (e.g., cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease).
- Rarely, high motor block may require cardiac and ventilatory support.

#### High Spinal Block

- **Definition:** Occurs when local anesthetic spreads cephalad more than desired, blocking unintended nerve fibers.
- **Clinical Manifestations:** Difficulty breathing, upper extremity numbness or weakness, loss of consciousness due to brainstem blockade.

#### Total Spinal Block

- **Definition:** Occurs when local anesthetic unintentionally reaches the CSF space in the subarachnoid space around the brain and brainstem.
- **Clinical Manifestations:** Complete paralysis, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest due to diaphragmatic paralysis.

#### Incidence and Impact

- Incidence as high as 71%, 80% requiring vasopressor treatment.
- Maternal mortality accounts for 2% of maternal deaths, with over half due to spinal hypotension.
- Associated with nausea, vomiting, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, death, and fetal compromise.

#### PRAM Score

- **Predictive Factors for Hypotension:**
	- Maternal age >25 years (age >25 = 1)
	- Preoperative heart rate >90 bpm (HR >90 = 1)
	- Preoperative MAP <90 mmHg (MAP <90 = 1)
- **Scoring:**
	- PRAM score of 3 indicates more than twice the likelihood of hypotension compared to scores of 0-1.
#### Management of Spinal Hypotension in Patients Undergoing Cesarean Section

##### Healthy Patient

- **Decrease in BP by 30%**
	- **Fluid bolus:** 500 mL - 1 L
	- **Observe:** Consider pressors (e.g., ephedrine, phenylephrine)
	- **Trendelenburg:** Consider positioning

##### Patient with Cardiac Disease, History of CVA, or CNS Disorder

- **Decrease in BP by 30% (Patient symptomatic: nausea, vomiting, chest pain, etc.)**
	- **HR < 70 bpm:**
		- Ephedrine 5-10 mg IV
		- Repeat in 2-3 min as needed
		- Fluid bolus 500 mL - 1 L
		- Consider Trendelenburg positioning
	- **HR ≥ 80 bpm:**
		- Phenylephrine 50-100 mcg IV
		- Repeat in 2-3 min as needed
		- Fluid bolus 500 mL - 1 L
		- Consider Trendelenburg positioning

##### Response to Treatment

- **Responds to Treatment:**
	- Continue bolus as needed until blood pressure normalizes
- **No Response:**
	- Frequent medication boluses as needed or symptomatic patient

#### Decrease in BP by 50% or HR < 50 Bpm in Any Patient

- **No prompt response to therapy:**
	- Epinephrine 8-16 mcg IV
	- Escalate dose of IV epinephrine as needed
	- Consider epinephrine infusion (0.15-0.3 mcg/kg/min) titrated to BP
## Motor Block Classification

## Impact of Neuraxial Analgesia on Labour Outcomes

### Effect on the Duration of Labour
- **First Stage of Labour**:
  - Variable impact. Any prolongation is minimal, with no significant adverse maternal or fetal effects.
- **Second Stage of Labour**:
  - Mean duration extends by 15-20 minutes for women receiving epidurals compared to those receiving systemic opiates or no analgesia. This effect is more pronounced in nulliparous women.
  - The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines:
	- Second-stage arrest is defined as no descent or rotation of the fetal head for:
	  - 4 hours in nulliparous women with epidural analgesia (EA)
	  - 3 hours in nulliparous women without EA
	  - 3 hours in parous women with EA
	  - 2 hours in parous women without EA
  - Stopping the epidural is not recommended if the fetal head has not descended. Once the head is on the perineum without the mother feeling the urge to push, reducing the epidural maintenance rate is reasonable.
- **Third Stage of Labour**:
  - Epidural analgesia does not prolong this stage.

### Effect on Caesarean Section (CS) Rate
- There is a common perception that epidural analgesia increases the CS rate.
- Numerous large RCTs comparing neuraxial (primarily epidural) analgesia with systemic opiate (mainly pethidine) analgesia found no significant difference in CS rates.
- Intent-to-treat analyses eliminate differences in CS rates between groups.
- Impact studies, such as the COMET study (Lancet, 2001), found no significant difference in CS rates across different neuraxial analgesia methods.
- High-quality evidence indicates no difference in CS risk whether epidural labour analgesia is initiated early or later in labour.
- The misconception likely arises because women requiring more analgesia early in labour may already be at higher risk for CS due to other factors.

### Effect on Instrumental Vaginal Delivery Rate
- Studies provide conflicting results.
- Higher concentrations of epidural local anesthetics (LAs) lead to more significant maternal motor blockade, which can impair fetal head rotation and maternal pushing ability.
- Effective blocks during the second stage increase the risk of instrumental vaginal delivery (forceps or vacuum extraction).

### Impact on Fetal Outcomes
- **Direct Effects**:
  - Caused by maternal absorption and transplacental transfer of drugs.
  - Possible impacts include fetal heart rate (FHR) changes and neonatal respiratory depression, although epidural opioids seldom accumulate to cause significant effects.
- **Indirect Effects**:
  - Result from the neuraxial block's effects on the mother.
  - Rapid analgesia onset reduces circulating catecholamines, increasing uterine tone and potentially decreasing uteroplacental perfusion, leading to fetal hypoxia. This is more pronounced with CSE than with epidural analgesia.
  - FHR must be monitored during and after neuraxial analgesia administration.

### Effects on Breastfeeding
- Recent studies indicate low-dose LA and low-dose fentanyl epidural regimens do not significantly impact the initiation or duration of breastfeeding.

## Adjuvants

### Epinephrine
- Shortens latency, reduces minimum local analgesic concentration (MLAC), and prolongs epidural LA analgesia.
- Systemic absorption may increase maternal heart rate and transiently affect uterine activity but does not adversely affect intervillous blood flow.
- Disadvantages: increases motor block intensity and risk of drug errors.

### Clonidine
- Enhances quality and duration of epidural LA analgesia without additional motor block.
- Useful for breakthrough pain with a functioning catheter.
- In the US, carries a black box warning for bradycardia and hypotension risks.
- Side effects: maternal sedation and FHR changes at higher doses.

### Neostigmine
- No significant benefit as an epidural adjuvant unless combined with clonidine.
- Further studies needed to clarify its role.

## The Epidural Test Dose

- Used to identify unintentional epidural catheter placement in an epidural vein or the subarachnoid space.
- Intravascular placement occurs in 7-8.5% of obstetric patients.
- A combined intrathecal and intravenous test dose: 3 mL of lignocaine 1.5% + adrenaline 5 mcg/mL or 3 mL of bupivacaine 0.25% + adrenaline 5 mcg/mL.
  - Positive intravascular result: heart rate increase of 20 bpm within one minute.
  - Positive intrathecal result: motor blockade with hip flexion weakness at 3-5 minutes.
- Arguments against:
  - Potential decrease in uteroplacental perfusion and fetal compromise risk.
  - Aspiration of multi-orifice catheters is 98% sensitive for identifying intravascular location.
  - The test dose may cause undesirable motor blockade.
  - Modern low-concentration LA solutions reduce the risk of cardiovascular collapse or total spinal anaesthesia from unintentional administration.
  - Single test doses cannot exclude later catheter migration.
- Arguments for:
  - Large volumes of concentrated LA are still used for emergency CS.
  - Easier identification and replacement of misplaced catheters during initial placement.

## Combined Spinal-Epidural (CSE) Analgesia

- Most common technique: needle-through-needle in a midlumbar interspinous space.
- Typical intrathecal doses for labour analgesia: fentanyl 10-12.5 mcg or sufentanil 5 mcg.
- **Advantages**:
  - Faster onset of complete analgesia (2-5 minutes) compared to lumbar epidural (10-15 minutes).
  - Rapid sacral analgesia onset.
  - Allows use of lipid-soluble opiates without LA, reducing motor block and hypotension.
  - Lower maternal, fetal, and neonatal plasma concentrations of anaesthetic agents.
  - Reduces epidural analgesia failure and increases successful CS anaesthesia.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Potential higher risk of postdural puncture headache.
  - Small risk of meningitis.
  - Intrathecal opiates cause more pruritus.
  - Inability to test epidural catheter placement for 1-2 hours.
  - Possible higher risk of fetal bradycardia due to acute reduction in maternal catecholamines.

## Continuous Caudal Analgesia
- More challenging and higher infectious risk.
- Risk of accidental rectal or fetal injection in advanced labour.
- Requires large LA volumes for low thoracic blockade, leading to higher maternal plasma concentrations.
- Useful for patients with lumbar vertebral fusion.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Techniques
- Considerations:
  - Preparation time
  - Analgesia length and quality
  - Untested catheter
  - Hypotension
  - Conversion to anaesthesia
  - General risks

# Regional for C/S

## Spinal
- Bupivacaine(10 to 15 mg)
- Adding fentanyl, 10 to 25 mcg, or sufentanil, 5 to 10 mcg, to the intrathecal local anesthetic solution enhances the intensity of the spinal block and prolongs its duration without adversely affecting neonatal outcome. The addition of preservative-free morphine, 0.1 to 0.3 mg, can prolong postoperative analgesia up to 24 h but requires monitoring for delayed post administration respiratory depression.
- In obese patients, a standard 3.5-in.(9-cm) spinal needle may not be long enough to reach the subarachnoid space. In such cases, longer spinal needles of 4.75 in. (12 cm) to 6 in. (15.2 cm) may be required. To prevent these longer needles from bending, some anesthesiologists prefer larger diameter needles, such as the 22-gauge Sprotte needle.Alternatively, a 2.5-in. (6.3-cm) 20-gauge Quincke-type spinal needle can be used as a long introducer and guide for a 25-gauge pencil-point spinal needle
## Epidural
- After negative aspiration and a negative test dose, a total volume of 15 to 35 mL of local anesthetic is injected slowly in 5-mL increments to minimize the risk of systemic local anesthetic toxicity. Lidocaine 2% (typically with 1:200,000 epinephrine) most commonly used
- The addition of fentanyl, 50 to 100 mcg, or sufentanil, 10 to 20 mcg, greatly enhances analgesic intensity and prolongs its duration without adversely affecting neonatal outcome. Some practitioners also add sodium bicarbonate (7.5% or 8.4% solution) to local anesthetic solutions (1 mEq sodium bicarbonate/10 mL of lidocaine) to increase the concentration of the nonionized fraction
- If pain develops as the sensory level recedes, additional local anesthetic is administered in 5mL increments to maintain a T4 sensory level.“Patchy” anesthesia prior to delivery of the infant can be treated with 10 to 20 mg of intravenous ketamine in combination with 1 to 2 mg of midazolam or 30% nitrous oxide
- Epidural morphine, 5 mg, at the end of surgery provides good to excellent pain relief postoperatively for 6 to 24 h
- Postoperative analgesia can also be provided by continuous epidural infusions of fentanyl, 25 to 75 mcg/h, or sufentanil, 5 to 10 mcg/h, at a volume delivery rate of approximately 10 mL/h
## Alternative Analgesia
### Paracervical Block
- First stage
- Somatic pain relief, adjunctive, can cause bradycardia. Cannot use as only agent. Doesn't interfere with labour or foetal outcome
### Pudendal Block
- It is used for pain relief during the second stage of labor in spontaneous or vacuum deliveries and for perineal tear repairing
- Complications: hematoma, infection, and nerve damage
# Special Circumstances in Labour Analgesia

## The Walking Epidural
- Low-dose CSE opioid analgesia maintains motor function and allows the ability to walk.
- As the cumulative dose of local anesthetic (LA) increases, significant motor block may develop, necessitating the testing of the woman's ability to walk safely before getting out of bed.

### Criteria for Ambulation During Labour Analgesia
1. Reassuring fetal status
2. Engagement of fetal presenting part
3. Stable orthostatic vital signs (within 10% of baseline)
4. Ability to perform bilateral straight-leg raises in bed against resistance
5. Ability to step up on a step stool with either leg, without assistance
6. Satisfactory trial of walking accompanied by a nurse or midwife
7. Patient to be accompanied by a companion at all times
8. Intermittent fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring every 15 minutes

### Benefits
- Minimisation of motor blockade enhances the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal delivery.
- Reducing motor block should be prioritized in neuraxial labour analgesia, irrespective of the patient's desire to ambulate.

### Typical CSE Regimens
- **Standard Spinal Dose:** 2.5 mg bupivacaine + 25 mcg fentanyl; Epidural dose: 0.1% bupivacaine + 2 mcg/mL fentanyl (15 mL intermittent bolus or 8-15 mL/h infusion).
- **Queen Charlotte's Hospital Regimen:** Spinal dose: 2.5 mL of epidural mixture (0.1% bupivacaine + 2 mcg/mL fentanyl) = 2.5 mg bupivacaine + 5 mcg fentanyl; Epidural dose: as above.
- **Royal Free Hospital Regimen:** Spinal dose: 2.5 mg bupivacaine + 5 mcg sufentanil; Epidural infusion: 0.0625% bupivacaine + 0.25 mcg/mL sufentanil at 10-12 mL/h.

## Epidural Labour Analgesia in VBAC
### Concerns
1. EA might mask pain of uterine scar separation or rupture, delaying diagnosis.
2. Sympathectomy from EA might attenuate maternal compensatory response to hemorrhage associated with uterine rupture.

### Consensus and Rationales
1. Pain, uterine tenderness, and tachycardia have low sensitivity and specificity as diagnostic signs of lower uterine segment scar dehiscence or rupture.
2. Breakthrough pain during previously effective epidural analgesia might indicate uterine rupture ("epidural sieve").
3. Most cases of scar dehiscence do not lead to severe hemorrhage; prompt volume replacement is crucial if significant bleeding occurs.
4. Successful epidural analgesia in VBAC is well-documented, with no adverse effects on maternal or neonatal outcomes.
5. Epidural analgesia facilitates postpartum uterine exploration to assess scar integrity.
6. Provides rapid access to surgical anesthesia if necessary.
7. Adequate pain relief may encourage more women to opt for VBAC, potentially reducing unnecessary repeat cesarean deliveries.

## Management of Epidural Analgesia
### Assess Progress of Labour
1. Rule out other pain causes (e.g., distended bladder, ruptured uterus).
2. Evaluate if the catheter is correctly placed in the epidural space; replace if in doubt.
3. If neuroblockade is inadequate (not from T10 to S4):
   - Inject 5-15 mL of dilute LA, with or without an opioid.
   - Adjust maintenance technique (increase volume, decrease concentration).
   - Replace the catheter if necessary.
4. For asymmetric blocks:
   - Inject 5-15 mL of dilute LA, with or without an opioid.
   - Adjust maintenance technique.
   - Place the less-blocked side in the dependent position.
   - Replace the catheter if necessary.
5. For breakthrough pain despite adequate neuroblockade:
   - Inject a more concentrated LA solution, with or without an opioid.
   - Adjust maintenance technique (increase LA concentration).

## Epidural for Vaginal Delivery
- More concentrated or larger volume of epidural LA is needed for sacral analgesia/anaesthesia during the second stage, especially for episiotomy or instrumental delivery, but this may cause extensive motor blockade.
- If analgesia is inadequate:
  1. **Lumbar Epidural Catheter:** Supplement with 5-10 mL of 1% or 2% lignocaine.
  2. **Spinal Anaesthesia:** Intrathecal injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine (6-8 mg) or hyperbaric lignocaine (25-50 mg).
  3. **Combined Spinal-Epidural Anaesthesia:** Intrathecal injection of bupivacaine (2.5-5 mg) with fentanyl (15-25 mcg), followed by additional epidural administration if needed.

## Extension of Epidural Labour Analgesia to Surgical Anaesthesia for Caesarean Delivery
- Choice of LA depends on urgency. Lignocaine 2% with adrenaline offers faster onset than bupivacaine/levobupivacaine 0.5% or ropivacaine 0.75%.
- Initiation of epidural analgesia extension during patient transfer to the OR is controversial.
- Quality of existing labour analgesia affects decision to use in-situ epidural catheter for anesthesia.
- Failed conversion is more likely if multiple epidural boluses were required, urgency is high, or a nonobstetric anaesthetist manages the case.
- Extending T10 analgesia to T4 anaesthesia typically needs 15-20 mL of LA with adjuvants. Alkalinisation improves onset speed and quality.
- **Bupivacaine 0.5%:** 5 mL increments, totaling 15-20 mL.
- **Alternative Mixture:** 17 mL 2% lignocaine, 50 mcg fentanyl, 1 mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mL 1:10,000 adrenaline (diluted to 1:200,000). Administer 5 mL boluses after a test dose.
- Treat patients as having no block if initial epidural dose was given over an hour ago. Re-site poorly functioning catheters or consider CSE or spinal anesthesia.

- Use smaller endotracheal tube (edematous airway).

### Risk Factors
- Increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage.
- Post-operative high care or ICU required.
