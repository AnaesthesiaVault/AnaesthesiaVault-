# Common Causes of Maternal Collapse

## Common Causes of Maternal Cardiac Arrest

- **A:** Anesthetic complications/accidents
- **B:** Bleeding
- **C:** Cardiovascular
- **D:** Drugs
- **E:** Embolic
- **F:** Fever
- **G:** General nonobstetric causes (H’s and T’s)
- **H:** Hypertension

## Initial Management Steps

1. **Recognition:**
	- Unresponsive, no breathing or abnormal breathing, uterus at or above the umbilicus.
2. **Activate Emergency Response System:**
	- Minimum of 3 additional staff + code cart.
	- ACLS: maternal code team activation.
	- Second responder: get AED immediately and apply.

## Maternal Cardiac Arrest Algorithm

### Step-by-Step Management

1. **Check Pulse:**
	- Definite pulse within 10 seconds?
		- **Yes:**
			- Using bag-mask, give 1 breath every 5-6 seconds.
			- Recheck pulse every 2 minutes.
		- **No or Unsure:**
			- Document time, start high-quality chest compressions.
			- Apply AED, perform appropriate airway management, perform continuous manual left uterine displacement (LUD).

### Shockable Rhythm

- Give 1 shock, resume CPR immediately for 2 minutes.

### Non-shockable Rhythm

- Resume CPR immediately for 2 minutes.
- Check rhythm every 2 minutes; if not shockable, perform fluid resuscitation if Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA).

## Chest Compressions in Pregnancy

- Use a firm backboard.
- Place patient supine.
- Place hands in the center of the chest.
- Compress at a rate of at least 100/min.
- Compress at a depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm).
- Minimize interruptions, allow complete chest recoil.
- Perform continuous manual LUD.

## Appropriate Airway Management for Pregnancy

- Open airway using head tilt-chin lift maneuver (if not a trauma victim).
- Administer 100% O2 at ≥ 15 L/min.
- Perform bag-mask ventilation:
	- Seal mask, ensure no leak, 2-handed technique.
	- Deliver each rescue breath over 1 second.
	- Give 2 breaths for every 30 compressions.
	- Ensure visible chest rise.
- Avoid excessive ventilation.

## Maternal Cardiac Arrest Team Interventions

1. **Maternal Interventions:**
	- Appropriate airway management.
	- IV above diaphragm.
	- Give typical ACLS drugs and dosages.
	- Assess for hypovolemia and give fluid bolus +/- blood products.
	- If receiving IV magnesium prearrest, stop and give IV calcium.
2. **Obstetric Interventions:**
	- Continuous manual LUD.
	- Remove/detach fetal monitors.
	- Prepare for emergency cesarean delivery.

## Indications for Perimortem Cesarean Section

- Estimated gestational age ≥ 20 weeks.
- Person able to perform the procedure.
- Resources for post-operative care of mother and child.
- Perform perimortem cesarean section at the earliest stage unless return of spontaneous circulation is achieved.

# Considerations

- Maternal CPR is altered from normal after 22 weeks gestation.
- Two patients are involved, with efforts focused on maternal resuscitation.
- Pregnancy considerations include difficult intubation, aspiration risk, decreased time to desaturation, aortocaval compression, and care for both mother and fetus.

## Modifications in Maternal CPR

- Wedge 15-30° or use left uterine displacement.
- Place hands higher on the sternum for chest compressions.
- Perform slightly quicker compressions.
- Intubate early due to aspiration risk.
- Remove CTG prior to defibrillation.
- Quickly prepare for perimortem cesarean section (within 5 minutes) to save the baby and relieve aortocaval compression (not needed if fetus < 20 weeks).

## Need for Modified ACLS Techniques

- Use supradiaphragmatic IV.
- Perform left uterine displacement.
- Place chest compressions higher on the sternum than usual.
- Intubate early.
- Prepare for perimortem cesarean section if no ROSC within 4 minutes of resuscitation, aiming for delivery within 5 minutes.
- Rapidly diagnose and treat underlying etiology, including BEAU-CHOPS, H'sT's, magnesium sulfate toxicity, and local anesthetic toxicity.
- Consider aggressive interventions for difficult resuscitation (e.g., cardiopulmonary bypass, hypothermia, internal cardiac massage).

## Differential Diagnosis

### BEAU-CHOPS + H'sT's

- **B:** Bleeding/DIC
- **E:** Embolism (coronary, pulmonary, Safe)
- **A:** Anesthetic complications (high spinal, aspiration, failed airway, local anesthetic toxicity)
- **U:** Uterine atony
- **C:** Cardiac disease (MI/ischemia/aortic dissection/cardiomyopathy)
- **H:** Hypertension/preeclampsia/eclampsia
- **O:** Other (H's and T's from ACLS guidelines):
	- **H:** Hyper-/hypokalemia, hypothermia, hypovolemia, hydrogen ion (acidosis), hypoxia
	- **T:** Tension pneumothorax, tamponade (cardiac), thrombus (coronary, pulmonary), toxins
- **P:** Placenta abruptio/previa
- **S:** Sepsis

## Gestational Age & Viability

- Fetal viability begins at approximately 24-25 weeks.
- Estimate gestational age:
	- <20 weeks: Urgent cesarean section is not necessary as the gravid uterus of this size is unlikely to significantly compromise cardiac output.
	- 20-23 weeks: Consider cesarean section primarily for maternal resuscitation, not for infant survival.
	- ≥24 weeks: Perform cesarean section within 5 minutes for maternal and fetal resuscitation.
