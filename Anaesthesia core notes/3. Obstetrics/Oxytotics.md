# Oxytocics

## Types of Agents

### Carbetocin
- **Description:**
  - Carbetocin is a synthetic analogue of oxytocin with similar pharmacodynamic properties but longer acting.
  - It is an octapeptide, whereas oxytocin is a nonapeptide, making carbetocin more stable and resistant to degradation by disulphidase, aminopeptidase, and oxidoreductase enzymes.
  - The half-life of carbetocin is approximately 40 minutes, which is 10 times that of oxytocin.
- **Side Effects:**
  - Similar to oxytocin: hypotension, flushing, headache, and abdominal pain.
  - Lower incidence of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) after caesarean deliveries compared with oxytocin.
- **ED90 Dose During Caesarean Delivery:**
  - Ranges from 14.8 µg in non-labouring women to 121 µg in labouring women.
- **Dosing During Caesarean Section:**
  - The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommends 100 µg carbetocin as an intravenous bolus over one minute to prevent PPH.

### Misoprostol
- **Description:**
  - Second-line drug for the treatment of PPH.
  - Prostaglandin E1 analogue.
  - Can be administered orally, sublingually, buccally, vaginally, or rectally.
  - WHO recommends sublingual misoprostol 200-800 µg.
- **Side Effects:**
  - Pyrexia, shivering, and gastrointestinal disturbances.
  - Best used when other methods have failed or when oxytocin and methyl ergometrine are unavailable.

### Oxytocin
- **Production and Secretion:**
  - Produced in the hypothalamus, transported as vesicles via nerve axons to nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary, stored in granules, and released in response to action potentials from the hypothalamus.
- **Chemical Constitution:**
  - Small peptide hormone structurally similar to ADH.
- **Oxytocin vs ADH:**
  - Oxytocin is a vasodilator causing hypotension, primarily functioning in females.
  - ADH is a vasoconstrictor that increases blood pressure and functions in both genders.
- **Indications:**
  - Termination of pregnancy (TOP), labour induction and augmentation, active management of the third stage of labour, and PPH.
- **Mechanism of Action:**
  - Acts on oxytocin receptors on the uterus, increasing intracellular calcium, interacting with calmodulin, and increasing uterine motility.
- **Clinical Effects:**
  - Uterine contraction, lactation, and bonding.
  - Half-life: 1-6 minutes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
  - Absorption: IV - immediate; IM - 3-5 minutes.
  - Distribution: Extracellular fluid, placenta, milk; protein binding 30%.
  - Metabolism: Liver.
  - Excretion: Urine.
- **Side Effects:**
  - Cardiovascular: Vasodilation leading to decreased blood pressure.
  - Neuromuscular blockade: May enhance the effect of succinylcholine (suxamethonium).
  - Water intoxication: Due to antidiuretic effect.
  - Convulsions: Due to water intoxication.
  - Uterine hypertonicity.
  - Allergy and anaphylaxis.
- **Caesarean Section Dosing:**
  - Oxytocin 2.5 IU IV bolus, then 20 IU in 1 L clear fluid to run at 125 mL/hr in recovery.

## International Consensus Statement on the Use of Uterotonic Agents During Caesarean Section

### 10 Recommendations for Clinical Practice

1. **Routine Administration:**
   - Oxytocin or carbetocin is recommended immediately after the delivery of the fetus.

2. **Dosage:**
   - A universal dose for all cases is not appropriate.

3. **Administration:**
   - Oxytocin should be given slowly to reduce side effects. A small initial dose followed by a continuous infusion is the optimum approach.

4. **Elective Caesarean Section:**
   - For women having elective caesarean sections who are at high risk of uterine atony and haemorrhage, it may be appropriate to follow the dose regimen for intrapartum caesarean sections.

5. **Total Dose:**
   - Large total oxytocin doses should be avoided to minimize the antidiuretic effect. A concentrated solution using a syringe pump may be required for women who need fluid restriction.

6. **Carbetocin:**
   - Carbetocin is a longer-acting analogue of oxytocin. Its increased duration of action eliminates the need for an infusion after the initial dose.

7. **Second-Line Drugs:**
   - If oxytocin/carbetocin does not provide adequate uterine tone, a second-line drug should be considered early.

8. **Cardiac Disease:**
   - Women with significant cardiac disease may be very sensitive to the adverse effects of uterotonics, and their management needs to be individualized.

9. **Resource-Constrained Settings:**
   - In settings where controlled intravenous infusions are not readily available, infusion can be considered for sustained drug action.

10. **Prepared Solutions:**
   - Extreme care must be taken to ensure that pre-prepared syringes or solutions are not confused with other drugs administered during this period.

### Uterotonic Agents Use

#### Oxytocin
- **Elective LSCS:**
  - 1 IU followed by 2.7-7.5 IU/h.
- **Intrapartum LSCS:**
  - 3 IU over 30 seconds followed by 7.5-15 IU/h.
- **Additional Dose:**
  - A further 3 IU over 30 seconds if required.

#### Carbetocin
- **Elective LSCS:**
  - 100 µg over 30 seconds.
- **Additional Dose:**
  - Smaller doses (as low as 20 µg and up to 100 µg) may be sufficient for elective LSCS.
  - Do not exceed 100 µg.

#### Second-Line Agents
- **Ergometrine:**
  - 200-500 µg intramuscularly (i.m.) or slowly intravenously (i.v.) in exceptional circumstances; may be repeated after 2 hours.
- **Misoprostol:**
  - 400-600 µg sublingually, rectally, vaginally, or orally; repeat after 15 minutes if required, maximum dose 800 µg.
- **Carboprost:**
  - 250 µg intramuscularly or intramyometrially (contraindicated intravenously); up to every 15 minutes if required, maximum eight doses.
- **Sulprostone:**
  - 500 µg intravenously at 100 µg/h; maximum dose 1500 µg.

# Use in Cardiac Patients
- **Oxytocin:** Drops systemic vascular resistance (SVR); give cautiously:
  - Dilute to 0.1 unit per mL. Give 0.1 unit at a time and monitor uterine contraction until adequate.
  - Halve the infusion dose and run slowly.
- **Prostacyclin:** Use cautiously with raised pulmonary pressures.
- **Ergometrine:** Contraindicated in hypertension.
- **Misoprostol:** Use cautiously in ischemic heart disease (IHD); otherwise well tolerated.
