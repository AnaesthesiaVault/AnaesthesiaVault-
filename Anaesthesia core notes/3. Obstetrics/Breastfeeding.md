# Breastfeeding Patient

## Advantages

### For the Baby
- Maternal and infant bonding
- Development of neonatal/infant immunity
- Optimal nutrition

### For the Mother
- Postpartum involution of uterine size
- Reduced risk of ovarian and breast cancer
- Protection from developing type 2 diabetes
- Contraception during exclusive breastfeeding

## Lactogenesis

### Stage I
- Under the influence of progesterone, prolactin, and HPL, mammary cells produce fat droplets.

### Stage II
- Milk secretion occurs after delivery as progesterone and estrogen levels decline.
- Baby suckling stimulates the release of oxytocin and prolactin, which promote milk secretion.

## Composition of Breast Milk
- **Carbohydrates:** Lactose and oligosaccharides
- **Fats:** Triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids, steroid hormones
- **Proteins:** Caseins, alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, secretory IgA, lysozyme
- **Minerals:** Sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate

## Nutritional Functions
- Bacteriostatic properties
- Anti-inflammatory effects
- Promotion of growth
- Aid in digestion
- Initial milk is colostrum (48-72 hours), which is high in protein and fats, followed by foremilk (watery) and then more fatty hindmilk.
- May produce 500-1000 ml per day.

## Transfer of Medications into Breast Milk

- “Pump and Dump” postop is outdated and no longer recommended.
- **All anesthetic/analgesic drugs transfer to breast milk**
  - Passive diffusion is most common.
  - Highly lipid-soluble, less protein-bound, low molecular weight, or higher pKa drugs have greater penetration into breast milk.

### Ideal Drug Properties in Breastfeeding
- High maternal protein binding
- High degree of ionization
- Short half-life
- Poor oral bioavailability
- Low lipid solubility

### Relative Infant Dose (RID)
- Reflects relative neonatal drug exposure via breast milk.
- RID <10% is considered safe.
- Almost all anesthetic drugs have RID <<10%.

### Drugs Not Recommended in Breastfeeding Mothers
- Codeine, Tramadol (metabolized by CYP2D6 - ↑ risk if “ultra-metabolizer” mother breastfeeds “slow metabolizer” neonate)
- Meperidine, high-dose morphine (low dose ok)
- For more information on specific agents: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922/)

### Minimizing Opioids/Sedatives
- Use multimodal analgesia and regional techniques when possible.
- Pain interferes with successful breastfeeding–treat appropriately.
- Monitor patient and infant for sedation and respiratory depression.
- Resume breastfeeding as soon as possible postop (when the patient is awake, alert, and able to hold the infant).

## Maintaining Supply of Breast Milk
- Surgical stress often causes a decrease in supply.
- Maintenance of adequate hydration:
  - No prolonged fasting, encourage carbohydrate-containing clear fluids until 2 hours preop.
  - IV fluids (with or without dextrose) while NPO.
  - PONV prophylaxis (e.g., Ondansetron, Metoclopramide, TIVA).
- Avoid drugs that may decrease supply:
  - Antihistamines
  - Anticholinergics
  - Phenylephrine
- Breastfeed or pump immediately preand post-op, if possible.

- **Etomidate:** Safe
- **Thiopentone:** Safe
- **Ketamine:** Uncertain

### Volatiles
- **All volatile agents:** Safe
- **N₂O:** Can cause 1st trimester pregnancy loss

- **Paracetamol:** Safe
- **Aspirin:** Safe

### NMB (Neuromuscular Blockers)
- **All agents:** Safe

### Reversal Agents
- **Neostigmine:** Safe (chronic use, such as in myasthenia, is a problem)

### Anticholinergics
- **Atropine:** Safe
- **Glycopyrrolate:** Safe

### Antiemetics
- **Dexamethasone:** Safe
- **Ondansetron:** Safe

## Anaesthesia for Breastfeeding Patients

### Pre-Operative Considerations
- Avoid prolonged pre-operative fasting.
- Counsel the mother regarding the use of drugs with low transferability into breast milk.
- Assure the mother that the infant will be monitored post-operatively.
- Explain the advantages of neuraxial techniques:
  - Faster recovery
  - Reduced drug usage
  - Less post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV)
  - Extended pain relief
  - Earlier return to breastfeeding

### General Anaesthesia (GA)
- **Medications:**
  - Midazolam
  - Propofol and neuromuscular blockers
  - Any volatile agents
  - Reversals are safe
  - Standard anti-emetics are safe
- **Other Considerations:**
  - Ensure adequate hydration
  - Minimize opioid use

### Suspension of Breastfeeding
- Mothers can store milk prior to the operation.
- Post-operative milk can be pumped and discarded for 24 hours (Note: there is no strong evidence to support this recommendation).
