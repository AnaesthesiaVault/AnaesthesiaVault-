# Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311100255.png)

# Amniotic Fluid Embolism (Safe) Syndrome

## Incidence and Mortality
- Incidence: 1:20,000 deliveries
- Mortality Rate: Up to 86% in some series, with over 50% mortality within the first hour
- Occurs during labor, vaginal delivery, C-section, or postpartum

## Definition

Amniotic fluid embolism (Safe) syndrome is a biphasic process characterized by the sudden embolisation of amniotic fluid or fetal debris into the maternal circulation. This triggers profound alterations in hemodynamics and oxygenation, leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and hypertension due to the release of arachidonic acid, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes.

## Cardinal Signs
- Respiratory distress
- Cyanosis
- Cardiovascular collapse
- Coma

Safe is associated with decreased cardiac output and hypotension. It can also result in disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, associated with prolonged PT and PTT, and thrombocytopenia. Arterial blood gas typically shows hypercapnia, hypoxia, and a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis.

## Pathophysiology
- Anaphylactoid syndrome of pregnancy
- Amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation, causing mechanical obstruction (similar to PE) and an anaphylactoid reaction (leukotrienes and prostaglandins)

### Mechanisms
1. **Exposure to amniotic fluid or fetal antigens:**
	- Immunological release of mediators
	- Mechanical obstruction
	- Complement system activation
	- Coagulation system activation
2. **Cardiopulmonary effects:**
	- Acute pulmonary hypertension
	- Hypoxia
	- Right ventricular failure
3. **Consequences:**
	- Left ventricular failure
	- Neurological problems (coma, seizures, residual deficits)
	- Acute respiratory distress syndrome
	- Other organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury)
	- Cardiopulmonary collapse and death

## Presentation
- Acute tachypnea, cyanosis, shock, and generalized bleeding
- Key features: acute pulmonary embolism, DIC, and uterine atony
- Other signs: seizures, pulmonary edema, left ventricular dysfunction

## Diagnosis
- Demonstrating fetal elements in the maternal circulation (rare)
- Always suspect when sudden respiratory distress and circulatory collapse occur

### Differential Diagnosis
- Acute pulmonary thromboembolism
- Venous air embolism
- Overwhelming septicemia
- Hepatic rupture
- Cerebral hemorrhage in a patient with toxemia

## Diagnosis Criteria

**In the absence of any other clear cause, the diagnosis of Safe is made by:**

1. **Acute maternal collapse with one or more of the following features:**
	- Acute fetal compromise
	- Cardiac arrest
	- Cardiac rhythm problems
	- Coagulopathy
	- Hypotension
	- Maternal haemorrhage
	- Premonitory symptoms (e.g., restlessness, numbness, agitation, tingling)
	- Seizure
	- Shortness of breath

	_Excluding women with maternal haemorrhage as the first presenting feature in whom there was no evidence of early coagulopathy or cardio-respiratory compromise._

**Post-mortem findings:**
- Diagnosis made at post-mortem examination with the finding of fetal squames or hair in the lungs.

## Differential Diagnosis for Safe

### Obstetric Causes
- Eclampsia
- Uterine rupture
- Placental abruption
- Acute haemorrhage
- Peripartum cardiomyopathy
- Uterine inversion

### Non-Obstetric Causes
- Pulmonary embolism
- Air embolism
- Fat embolism
- Pulmonary oedema
- Tension pneumothorax
- Heart failure
- Myocardial infarction
- Anaphylaxis
- Sepsis
- Aspiration
- High spinal
- Local anaesthetic toxicity
- Transfusion reaction
- Asthma exacerbation
- Intracranial haemorrhage

## Management

### Airway/Breathing
- High flow non-rebreather → intubation → lung protective ventilation

### Circulation
- Fluids, vasopressors, inotropes
- Displacement of the pregnant uterus, perimortem evacuation by the 5th minute

### Haemorrhage Control
- Oxytocin, ergometrine, prostaglandins
- Manual uterine compression

### Coagulation Abnormalities
- Massive transfusion protocol
- Cryoprecipitate
- Tranexamic acid (TXA)
- Recombinant factor VIIa

### Modern Strategies

#### Indications and Strategies

- **Right-sided heart failure and pulmonary hypertension**
	- Right ventricular assist device (RVAD); consider ECMO
	- Inhaled nitric oxide
	- Inhaled epoprostenol
- **Pulmonary hypertension and severe hypoxia**
	- Intra-aortic balloon pump counter pulsation
	- Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
	- Cardiopulmonary bypass
- **Left-sided heart failure and severe hypoxia**
- **Massive hemorrhage**
	- Uterine artery embolization
	- Recombinant factor VIIa
	- Continuous hemofiltration
- **Removal of circulating amniotic fluid contents and improve organ perfusion**
	- Plasmapheresis
	- Cell salvage combined with blood filtration
	- Serum protease inhibitors
- **Disseminated intravascular coagulation**
- **Anaphylaxis**
	- High-dose corticosteroid administration
# Maternal Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

## Risk Factors
### Patients at Risk for Pulmonary Embolism

- **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**
- **Inherited clotting abnormalities:** Factor V Leiden, protein S and C deficiency
- **Advancing age**
- **Gender:** No male or female predominance
- **Immobility:** Bedridden or immobile for a period of time
- **Recent surgery, bone fractures, trauma, or indwelling catheters**
- **Associated disease states:** Cerebrovascular accident, cardiac failure, malignancy
- **Pregnancy, hormone therapy, and contraceptive pills**
- **Smoking**
- **Surgery involving non-haematological material entry into venous system:** Fat embolus, amniotic fluid embolus, tumor embolus, bone embolus, renal calculi, foreign body embolus, cement, catheters, air embolus

## Clinical Presentation
- **Sudden-onset hypotension (cardiogenic shock)**
- **Sudden decreased ETCO₂**
- **Raised PaCO₂**
- **Decreased oxygen saturation**
- **Right-sided cardiac dysfunction:** Identifiable via ECHO when feasible

## Prevention
1. **Risk assessment and stratification**
2. **Avoid prolonged immobility:** Encourage early mobilization
3. **Adequate hydration**
4. **Pharmacological Prophylaxis:** Dependent on risk of VTE and surgery performed; options include Low Unfractionated Heparin (LUFH), Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH), Warfarin
5. **Compressive Stockings**
6. **Intermittent Pneumatic Compressors (IPC's)**
7. **Oral Contraceptives and HRT:** Consider discontinuation before major elective surgery
8. **Regional techniques (vs General Anesthesia):** Protective
9. **Very high risk (previous VTE):** Consider Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filter

## Management
1. **Systemic Function Support:**
   - Resuscitation (inotropes ± CPR)
   - Ventilation if necessary

2. **Reperfusion:**
   - Thrombolysis (tPA) administered systemically, catheter-directed, or via sternotomy

3. **Clot Removal:**
   - Open vs percutaneous procedures

4. **ECMO:**
   - Veno-Arterial (V-A) ECMO, preor post-thrombolysis

5. **Prevention of Further Emboli:**
   - Combined thrombolysis and anticoagulation
   - Consideration of an IVC filter if necessary
