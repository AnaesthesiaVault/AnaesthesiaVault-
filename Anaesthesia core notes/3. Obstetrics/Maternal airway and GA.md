# Maternal Airway and General Anaesthesia (GA)

## Introduction
- General anaesthesia is associated with increased risks of:
  - Maternal morbidity and mortality.
  - Greater hemodynamic fluctuations during induction.
  - Need for additional analgesia during recovery.
- Maternal deaths are often related to airway problems such as inability to intubate, inability to ventilate, or aspiration pneumonitis.
- Fetal depression is usually not clinically significant with GA if delivery occurs within 10 minutes of induction. However, neonates delivered more than 3 minutes after uterine incision tend to have lower Apgar scores and pH values.

## Maternal GA

### Premedication
- **Antacid Prophylaxis**
  - Standard: Sodium citrate, 30 mL, 30 to 45 minutes prior to induction.
  - Additional risk factors: IV ranitidine, 50 mg, or metoclopramide, 10 mg, or both, 1 to 2 hours prior to induction.
- **Anti-sialagogue**
  - Glycopyrrolate, 0.1 mg can be considered.

### Positioning
- Head elevated (ramped) position, aligning the external auditory meatus with the suprasternal notch.

### Stepwise Procedure
1. Supine position with a wedge under the right hip.
2. Denitrogenation with 100% oxygen for 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Prepare and drape the patient for surgery.
4. Perform Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) with cricoid pressure when surgeons are ready.
   - **Drugs:** Propofol, 2 mg/kg, or ketamine, 1 to 2 mg/kg, and succinylcholine, 1.5 mg/kg.
   - Adjust or remove cricoid pressure if there is difficulty with intubation or mask ventilation. Remove for insertion of a Supraglottic Airway Device (SAD).
5. Confirm Endotracheal Tube (ETT) placement and begin surgery.
6. Avoid excessive hyperventilation (PaCO2 < 25 mm Hg) to prevent reduced uterine blood flow and fetal acidosis.
7. Use 50% O2 and 50% N2O below 1 MAC of volatile agent.
8. **Oxytocin Administration:**
   - Slow IV injection of 0.5 to 3 IU over 1 minute, followed by an infusion of 5 to 10 IU/h for 4 hours.
   - Other options: Methylergonovine (Methergine), 0.2 mg in 100 mL normal saline as an infusion over 10 minutes, or methylprostaglandin F2α (Hemabate), 0.25 mg intramuscularly.
9. Reverse the muscle relaxant completely and extubate the patient when awake to reduce aspiration risk.

## Awareness During General Anaesthesia (AAGA)
- Obstetric GAs account for 10% of reported AAGA cases.
- Must be discussed as part of the consent process.

### Risk Factors for AAGA in Obstetric Patients

| **Patient Factors** | **Organizational Factors** | **Technical Factors**                           |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Female sex          | Trainee anaesthetist       | Use of thiopental (sometimes inappropriately low doses) |
| Young age           | Out-of-hours surgery       | Rapid sequence induction                        |
| Obesity             | Urgent/immediate surgery   | Use of neuromuscular block                      |
| Difficult airway    |                            | Omission of opioids at induction                |

### Prevention
- Minimum MAC of 0.5.
- Achieve adequate end-tidal volatile levels as soon as possible to minimize the IV-inhalation gap (e.g., using a high initial concentration of volatile agent with high fresh gas flows).
- Use of nitrous oxide as a carrier gas during Caesarean section can reduce the required amount of volatile agent and does not decrease uterine tone.
- Administering an opioid before induction can help reduce the IV-inhalation gap duration and provide analgesia for airway instrumentation and skin incision.

# Maternal Difficult Airway Algorithm

## Master Algorithm–Obstetric General Anaesthesia and Failed Tracheal Intubation

### Algorithm 1: Safe Obstetric General Anaesthesia
1. **Pre-induction Planning and Preparation**
   - Team discussion.
2. **Rapid Sequence Induction**
   - Consider facemask ventilation (P_max 20 cmH₂O).
3. **Laryngoscopy**
   - Maximum 2 intubation attempts; 3rd attempt by experienced colleague.
   - **Success:** Verify successful tracheal intubation and proceed, plan extubation.
   - **Fail:** Proceed to Algorithm 2.

### Algorithm 2: Obstetric Failed Tracheal Intubation
1. **Declare Failed Intubation**
   - Call for help.
   - Maintain oxygenation.
2. **Supraglottic Airway Device (maximum 2 attempts) or Facemask**
   - **Success:** Determine if it is essential/safe to proceed with surgery immediately.
	 - **No:** Wake the patient.
	 - **Yes:** Proceed with surgery.
   - **Fail:** Proceed to Algorithm 3.

### Algorithm 3: Can't Intubate, Can't Oxygenate (CICO)
1. **Declare CICO**
   - Give 100% oxygen.
   - Exclude laryngospasm–ensure neuromuscular blockade.
2. **Front-of-Neck Access**

### Key Notes
1. Intubation attempts are limited to 2 + 1 (instead of 3 + 1).
2. SAD attempts are limited to 2 (not 3).
3. Detailed decision process for proceeding with surgery with a rescued airway.
4. Mandatory RSI.
5. Facemask is an alternative to SAD, not necessarily the next step.
