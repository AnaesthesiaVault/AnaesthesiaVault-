# Anticoagulation in Pregnancy

## Elective Peripartum Management of Anticoagulation Therapy in Pregnant Women with Prosthetic Heart Valves

1. **Stop warfarin at 36/40 weeks and switch to dose-adjusted SC-LMWH**. If unavailable, use UFH infusion.
2. **Last dose 24h before planned delivery at 38/40 weeks**.
3. **Bridge to dose-adjusted IV-UFH or intermittent LMWH (prophylactic dose)** with various regimens.
4. **Serial anti-Xa levels**: 0.2 - 0.5 considered safe for vaginal or cesarean delivery.
5. **Recommence IV-UFH or anti-Xa-guided SC-LMWH** 6 hours after uncomplicated delivery.
6. **Reintroduce warfarin** on day 5 to 7 postpartum.

## Therapeutically Anticoagulated Patient Who Requires Unscheduled Delivery

- **Stop all anticoagulants immediately**.

### Management Based on Anticoagulant Type

1. **Warfarin**
   - Administer **haemosolvex or FFP** to target an INR of 2.0.
   - Small doses of **Vitamin K** orally or IV.

2. **Therapeutic LMWH**
   - Protamine reversal: **1 mg protamine per 1 mg Clexane** given in the last 8 hours.

3. **IV-UFH**
   - Once stopped, **coagulation should normalize within 1-2 hours**.
   - Protamine if required (MOH risk): **1 mg per 100 units UFH given over the last 2-3 hours** (max 50 mg).

## Considerations for Neuraxial Block for Cesarean Section in Patients on Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) According to SOAP Consensus Statement

1. **Dosage Range**
2. **Time Since Last Dose**
3. **Coagulation Status Available**: aPTT within normal range or anti-Xa undetectable.

### Decision Aid for Neuraxial Procedures in Obstetric Patients Receiving Anticoagulants

### Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)

#### Dose of UFH

- **Low Dose (5,000 units SC twice or thrice daily)**
  - >4 to 6 hours since last dose:
	- Coagulation status available: Proceed if aPTT is within normal range or anti-factor Xa level is undetectable.
	- Coagulation status unavailable: Likely low risk to proceed with neuraxial.
- **Intermediate Dose (7,500 or 10,000 units SC twice daily, total daily dose ≤20,000 units)**
  - ≥12 hours since last dose:
	- Coagulation status available: Proceed if aPTT is within normal range or anti-factor Xa level is undetectable.
	- Coagulation status unavailable: Assess airway and balance GA risks.
- **High Dose (individual doses ≥10,000 units per dose, total daily dose >20,000 units)**
  - ≥24 hours since last dose:
	- Coagulation status available: Proceed if aPTT is within normal range or anti-factor Xa level is undetectable.
	- Coagulation status unavailable: Minimal data for risk assessment, consider not proceeding.

**Note:** For all women on UFH for >4 days, check platelet count before neuraxial procedure to rule out HIT.

1. **Proceed** if either >4-6 hours OR tests normal in low dose.
2. **Proceed** if both tests normal AND >time in high (24h) or medium (12h) dose.
3. **Risk/Benefit Assessment** if either >12 hours OR tests normal in medium dose.
4. **Avoid** in all other scenarios.

### Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)

#### Dose of LMWH

- **Low Dose**
  - Enoxaparin: ≤40 mg SC once daily or ≤30 mg SC twice daily.
  - Dalteparin: ≤5,000 units SC once daily.
  - ≥12 hours since last dose:
	- Likely low risk to proceed with neuraxial.
	- Balance risk for She with GA risks if considering not proceeding.
- **Intermediate Dose**
  - Enoxaparin: >40 mg SC once daily or >30 mg SC twice daily and <1 mg/kg SC once daily or <0.5 mg/kg SC twice daily.
  - Dalteparin: >5,000 units SC once daily and <120 units/kg SC once daily or <200 units/kg SC twice daily.
  - Insufficient data to recommend 12-24 hour interval.
- **High Dose**
  - Enoxaparin: ≥1 mg/kg SC twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg SC once daily.
  - Dalteparin: ≥120 units/kg SC once daily or ≥200 units/kg SC once daily.
  - ≥24 hours since last dose:
	- Likely low risk to proceed with neuraxial.
	- Consider not proceeding, balancing She risk.

**Note:** Protamine to reverse LMWH can achieve 60%-80% reversal of anti-Xa activity.

### Summary of ASRA Recommendations
- At no later than 36 weeks, oral anticoagulants should be switched to LMWH or UFH.
- At least 36 hours prior to delivery, LMWH should be discontinued and the patient converted to IV or SubQ UFH, if indicated.
- IV UFH should be stopped 4–6 hours prior to delivery.
- Resumption of prophylaxis should be held until at least 12 hours after vaginal delivery or epidural removal (whichever occurs later).
- Thromboprophylaxis should be held at least 24 hours after cesarean section.
- If higher doses are required, prophylaxis should be held at least 24 hours, regardless of vaginal or surgical delivery.

## SOAP Guidelines on the Peripartum Management of Women Receiving Thromboprophylaxis or Higher Dose Anticoagulants

### Antepartum

1. Outpatient MDT consult at 36/40 weeks.
2. Thromboprophylactic regimens that facilitate neuraxial procedures e.g., converting LMWH to LD-UFH 5,000U SC BD.
3. If continuing LMWH, anticipate the need to withhold.
4. Flagging of such patients on admission.
5. Patients on UFH >4 days should have platelet counts checked before any neuraxial procedure to rule out HIT.

### Intrapartum

- Admission for delivery should trigger an instruction to withhold anticoagulants and obtain obstetric advice for further management.

### Postpartum

- Plan for resuming anticoagulation after delivery.

### Postpartum Anticoagulant Recommencement and Neuraxial Catheter Removal

#### **Subcutaneous UFH**
- For SC UFH thromboprophylaxis:
  - Wait ≥1 hour after NB (no signs of PPH) and after CR before initiating or restarting UFH.
  - Indwelling catheters can be maintained with low dose UFH (5,000 U SC BD).
  - CR can occur 4-6 hours after a dose of UFH, with subsequent dosing ≥1 hour after CR.
  - Consider holding NSAIDs (excluding paracetamol).

#### **Intravenous UFH**
- Wait ≥1 hour after NB (if no signs of PPH) before initiating or restarting anticoagulation.

#### **LMWH**
- For low-dose LMWH thromboprophylaxis:
  - Wait ≥12 hours after NB and ≥4 hours after CR before initiating or restarting LMWH.
  - Indwelling catheters can be maintained with low-dose LMWH; CR ≥12 hours after LMWH, with subsequent dosing ≥24 hours after CR.
  - Consider holding NSAIDs.
- For higher dose LMWH:
  - Wait ≥24 hours after NB and ≥4 hours after CR before initiating or restarting LMWH.

**NB = Neuraxial Block; CR = Catheter Removal**

**Recommencing**
- UFH: 1 hour after NB/CR.
- LMWH: 12-24 hours after NB, 4 hours after CR.

**CR (as for neuraxial)**
- UFH: 4-6 hours.
- LMWH: 12-24 hours depending on dose.

| **General guidance**            | Heparin compounds are the preferred anticoagulant during pregnancy (level B) | For pregnant patients, recommend LMWH for prevention and treatment of VTE, instead of UFH (grade 1B) | Daily LMWH or BID UFH for all antepartum patients hospitalized for at least 72 h who are not at high risk of bleeding or imminent childbirth. |
|                                 |                                                                     | Women at very high risk of recurrent VTE (e.g., proximal VTE or PE close to the expected date of delivery) may benefit by having a planned delivery by induction or cesarean delivery as appropriate, so that the duration of time without anticoagulation can be minimized (no grade) | For women at high risk of childbirth or bleeding, mechanical thromboprophylaxis or a prophylactic dose of UFH (5000 U every 12 h) |
| **Conversion to UFH**           | Women receiving therapeutic or prophylactic LMWH may be converted to UFH in the last month of pregnancy or sooner if delivery appears imminent (level C) or planned delivery with withholding of anticoagulants for 24 h (no grade) | Women at highest risk of recurrent VTE (e.g., proximal VTE or PE within 2 wk) can be switched to IV UFH prior to planned delivery, which is then discontinued 4-6 h prior to the expected time of delivery or epidural insertion (no grade) | For women at high risk of childbirth or bleeding, prophylactic dose of UFH (5000 U every 12 h) should be used |
|                                 |                                                                     | For pregnant women receiving adjusted-dose LMWH and where delivery is planned, recommend discontinuation of LMWH at least 24 h prior to induction of labour or cesarean delivery (or expected time of neuraxial anesthesia) rather than continuing LMWH up until the time of delivery (grade 1B) |                                                                         |
| **Timing of neuraxial blockade** | It is recommended to withhold neuraxial blockade for 10-12 h after the last prophylactic dose of LMWH or 24 h after the last therapeutic dose of LMWH (level C) | If spontaneous labor occurs in women receiving anticoagulation, neuraxial anesthesia should not be used. Where the level of anticoagulation is uncertain and where laboratory support allows for rapid assessment of heparin levels, then testing can be considered to guide anesthetic and surgical management (no grade) | Antepartum or intrapartum UFH prophylaxis (≤10,000 U/d): No contraindications to timing of heparin dose and performance of neuraxial blockade<br>UFH therapeutic: wait 6 h after last dose before neuraxial blockade or check aPTT<br>LMWH prophylaxis: wait 12 h after last dose before neuraxial blockade<br>LMWH therapeutic: wait 24 h after last dose before neuraxial blockade |
