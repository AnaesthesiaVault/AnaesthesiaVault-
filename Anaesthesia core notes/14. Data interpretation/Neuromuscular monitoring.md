# Neuromuscular Block Management: Evidence-Based Principles and Practice

## Key Points

- Recent guidelines emphasize the importance of monitoring neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) and their antagonists.
- Residual neuromuscular block is common, often unrecognized, and harmful to patients.
- Recovery from neuromuscular block requires a calibrated train-of-four (TOF) ratio ≥0.9.
- Quantitative monitoring is essential to optimize surgical conditions and avoid residual neuromuscular block.
- Antagonism is more predictable with sugammadex than with neostigmine, but recovery without quantitative monitoring cannot be guaranteed.
### Introduction

Despite advances in NMBDs and monitoring technologies, residual neuromuscular block remains a significant clinical issue. This article reviews recent guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists (AoA), the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), and the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC). The focus is on quantitative neuromuscular monitoring, perioperative care strategies, and the pharmacology of NMBDs and reversal agents.

## Phases of Neuromuscular Block (Non-depolarising Blockade)

### Induction

**Post Induction, Before NMBD**:

- **TOF (train-of-four) count**: 4
- **TOF ratio**: 1.0
- **Fade**: None

**After NMBD**:

- **TOF count**: 4 (Fade +), 3-2-1 (Fade +)
- **Onset of NMB**

**Intubation**: Upon onset of NMB

### Maintenance

**Moderate Block**:

- **TOF count**: 1-3

**Deep Block**:

- **TOF count**: 0
- **PTC (Post-tetanic count)**: ≥1

**Complete Block**:

- **TOF count**: 0
- **PTC**: 0

### Emergence

**Shallow Block**:

- **TOF ratio**: <0.4
- **Fade**: +

**Minimal Block**:

- **TOF ratio**: 0.4-0.9
- **Fade**: None

**Acceptable Recovery**:

- **TOF ratio**: >0.9

**Extubation**: Upon acceptable recovery
## Onset Time, Recovery, and Sensitivity of Muscle Groups

**Quicker to slower NMB Onset and Recovery**:

- **Diaphragm**
- **Laryngeal muscles** (corrugator supercilii)
- **Adductor pollicis, abdominal and big toe flexor muscles, orbicularis oculi**: Slower

**Slower NMB Onset and Recovery**:

- **Pharyngeal and masseter muscles**, **genioglossus**

**Central Group of Muscles (Diaphragm/larynx)**:

- More resistant to NMB (quicker to recover) than peripheral and pharyngeal muscles
- Higher blood supply

**Muscle Sensitivity**:

- **Resistant**:
	- May breathe or cough at TOF counts of zero at adductor pollicis
- **Sensitive**:
	- At TOF ratios 0.7-0.9, predisposed to risk of airway obstruction and aspiration

**Consequences of Residual Paralysis**:

- <1%: Unexpected critical care admissions (AAGA)
- 1-5%: Postoperative pulmonary complications (POPC), reintubation, significant hypoxia
- ~30%: Diplopia, swallowing difficulty, muscle weakness, airway obstruction, delayed recovery
## Guidelines for Managing Neuromuscular Block

**AoA Monitoring Standards (6th Edition, 2021):**

- Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring should be used whenever NMBDs are administered, from before the initiation of block until recovery of the TOF ratio to >0.9.

**ASA Clinical Practice Guidelines (2023):**

- Strongly recommend quantitative monitoring over clinical signs or qualitative peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) use.
- Prefer monitoring the adductor pollicis muscle over eye muscle responses to facial nerve stimulation.

**ESAIC Guidelines (2023):**

- Emphasize the need for NMBDs for tracheal intubation and deep block for abdominal surgery.
- Advocate for quantitative neuromuscular monitoring at the adductor pollicis to exclude residual paralysis.

## Definitions of Levels of Neuromuscular Block

Neuromuscular block can be categorized based on the TOF ratio, TOF count, and post-tetanic count (PTC):

- **Complete Block:** PTC = 0
- **Deep Block:** PTC ≥ 1, TOF count = 0
- **Moderate Block:** TOF count 1-3
- **Shallow Block:** TOF ratio < 0.4
- **Minimal Block:** TOF ratio 0.4-0.9
- **Acceptable Recovery:** TOF ratio > 0.9

**Key Points:**

- Deep neuromuscular block may improve outcomes in laparoscopic surgery but evidence is mixed.
- Individualized titration of block depth is essential, with moderate block typically sufficient for most surgeries.
- Quantitative monitoring ensures adequate anaesthesia and block management.

## Monitoring and Reversal of Neuromuscular Block

**Quantitative Monitoring:**

- **Acceleromyography (AMG):** Measures thumb acceleration in response to ulnar nerve stimulation. AMG devices should be calibrated and normalized to ensure accurate TOF ratio measurements.
- **Electromyography (EMG):** Measures the electrical activity of muscles in response to nerve stimulation. EMG is considered more accurate and less affected by external factors compared to AMG.

**Reversal Agents:**

- **Neostigmine:** Requires coadministration of glycopyrrolate or atropine. Its antagonism is variable and dose-dependent on the level of block. Quantitative monitoring is essential to confirm adequate recovery.
- **Sugammadex:** Specifically binds to aminosteroidal NMBDs like rocuronium and vecuronium, allowing rapid and predictable reversal. Quantitative monitoring is still necessary to ensure complete recovery.
## Acetylcholine Receptor Occupancy and Train-of-Four Ratio

**Sugammadex Reversal Guidance**:

- **Immediate reversal**: 16 mg/kg
- **Post-tetanic count (PTC) 1-2**: 4 mg/kg
- **TOF count ≥2**: 2 mg/kg

**Neostigmine Reversal Guidance**:

- **Qualitative PNS**:
	
	- **PTC**: Wait
	- **TOF count 1-3**: Wait
	- **TOF count 4 (Fade +)**: 50 mcg/kg (*)
	- **TOF count 4 (No fade)**: 30 mcg/kg (*)
	- **TOF ratio >0.9**: No reversal
- **Quantitative Monitor**:
	
	- **TOF count 1-3**: Wait
	- **TOF ratio <0.4**: Wait
	- **TOF ratio 0.4-0.9**: 30 mcg/kg (*)
	- **TOF ratio >0.9**: No reversal

(*) May require up to 20 min after giving neostigmine (+) May require up to 10 min after giving neostigmine

**Graph Explanation**:

- Up to 75% of acetylcholine receptors may remain occupied when TOF ratio is 0.9, indicating a large margin of safety with respect to neuromuscular transmission.

## Clinical Practice Strategy

**Pre-induction**:

- Pre-list briefing for surgical operating requirements, level of block, patient positioning, and access for monitoring

**Induction**:

- Use ulnar nerve–adductor pollicis muscle combination
- Confirm electrode positioning and monitor function
- NMBD and hypnotics/opioids for optimal airway management and intubation

**Maintenance**:

- Ongoing monitoring with PTC and TOF count
- Facilitate NMBD top-up dosing based on surgical requirement
- Moderate block (TOF count 1-3) for most surgical procedures
- Planning for reversal based on surgery duration, depth of block, and availability of reversal agent

**Emergence and Extubation**:

- Ensure TOF ratio >0.9 (>0.95 with AMG) before extubation
	
- **Neostigmine reversal**: Effective within 10 min for minimal block (TOF ratio >0.4)
	
- **Sugammadex reversal**: For shallow and deeper blocks
	
- **Tips**:
	
	- Clean and dry skin before applying electrodes
	- Use AMG-based monitor for all phases if hand not accessible
- **Using PNS?**:
	
	- Not recommended if TOF ratio cannot be determined
	- Guaranteed recovery only with TOF ratio >0.9
	- Absence of fade ≠ ready for extubation
