## CVP Waveform

- Normal CVP: 2–8 mmHg

### Components

- **a wave:** Increase in pressure during right atrial contraction.
- **c wave:** Coincides with carotid pulsation. During early systole, right ventricular contraction causes the tricuspid valve to bulge into the right atrium, leading to a small increase in CVP.
- **x descent:** Atrial relaxation and downward movement of the right atrium during right ventricular contraction, leading to rapid right atrial filling.
- **v wave:** Continued venous return to the right atrium during ventricular systole; right atrial filling with a closed tricuspid valve.
- **y descent:** Decrease in CVP after the tricuspid valve opens, allowing blood flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle.
### Abnormal Shapes

- **Atrial Fibrillation (AF):** Loss of a waves.
- **Third-degree Heart Block:** Independent atrial and ventricular contraction results in occasional large a waves ('cannon a waves') when atria contract with a closed tricuspid valve.
- **Tricuspid Regurgitation:** Ventricular systole ejects blood into the right atrium, increasing CVP. The CVP waveform has a ‘giant v wave’, replacing the c wave, x descent, and v wave.
