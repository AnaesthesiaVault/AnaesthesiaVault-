# Pulmonary Artery Catheter (PAC)

## Overview

The use of PACs in intensive care has significantly decreased in recent years, largely due to the findings of the PAC-Man trial in 2005, which indicated a lack of evidence for benefit or harm in critically ill patients.

## Indications

- **Investigation and Quantification of Cardiac Shunts**
- **Perioperative Monitoring**:
	- Complex coronary and valvular surgery
	- Vascular surgery
	- Solid organ transplantation
- **Critical Care**:
	- Severe left or right ventricular failure
	- Pulmonary hypertension
	- Constrictive pericarditis
	- Valvular heart disease
	- Obtaining mixed venous oxygen saturations
	- Continuous cardiac output monitoring
- **Therapeutic Uses**:
	- Drug delivery to pulmonary circulation (e.g., prostacyclin)
	- Cardiac pacing

## Contraindications to Insertion

- Prosthetic tricuspid or pulmonic valves
- Right-sided valvular vegetations or thrombi
- Intracardiac right mass

## Catheter Specifications

- **Size**: Modern adult PACs are 7 or 7.5 French gauge (Fr), 110 cm long, with 10 cm markings along the length.
- **Lumens**: Typically four or five lumens.
- **Balloon**: Inflatable 1.5 ml balloon at the tip.
- **Ports**:
	- **Blue Lumen (Proximal Injectate Port)**: Terminates 30 cm from the tip, should lie within the right atrium.
	- **White Proximal Infusion Port**: Terminates 31 cm from the tip, should also lie in the right atrium.
	- **Yellow Distal Port**: Pulmonary artery lumen for measuring PA pressures and mixed venous saturation.
	- **Red Lumen**: Connects to the balloon for inflation/deflation.
- **Thermistor**: Located 4 cm from the tip, used for thermodilution cardiac output measurement.
- **Additional Features**: Pacing capabilities, continuous cardiac output, and oximetry measurement via fiberoptic sensors.

## Insertion Procedure

1. **Sterile Technique**: Insert using a sterile Seldinger technique similar to CVC insertion, via an 8 or 8.5 Fr introducer sheath with a high-volume sideport.
2. **Transducer Attachment**: Attach the PA transducer to the distal lumen to display waveform changes during flotation.
3. **Initial Advancement**: Advance 15-20 cm from the jugular vein (10-15 cm from subclavian, 30-40 cm from femoral) to the right atrium.
4. **Balloon Inflation**: Inflate the balloon (max 1.5 ml air) and advance ~10 cm, monitoring for ectopic beats and a change to the right ventricular waveform.
5. **Right Ventricular Pressure**: Systolic pressure 15-30 mmHg, diastolic pressure 1-6 mmHg.
6. **Pulmonary Artery Advancement**: Advance a further ~10 cm to float into the pulmonary artery.
7. **Pulmonary Artery Pressure**: Systolic pressure similar to right ventricular systolic pressure; diastolic pressure higher than in the right ventricle.
8. **Dicrotic Notch**: Closure of the pulmonic valve creates a dicrotic notch on the tracing.
9. **Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure (PAWP)**: Advance until “wedged” in a central PA branch, measuring PAWP or PAOP, indicative of left atrial pressures.
10. **TOE Guidance**: Use transoesophageal echocardiography for real-time visualization and confirmation of catheter placement.
11. **Imaging Confirmation**: Utilize fluoroscopy or chest x-ray as needed, ensuring placement within West Zone III.

## Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure (PAWP)

- **Normal Values**: 6-12 mmHg.
- **Physiological Correlation**: Estimates left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in patients with normal physiology, indicative of left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV).
- **Measurement Accuracy**: Requires the catheter tip in West Zone III to ensure a static blood column between the catheter tip in the PA and the left atrium.
- **Clinical Variations**:
	- **PAWP > LVEDP**: Seen in mitral stenosis or regurgitation, atrial myxoma, pulmonary venous obstruction, left-to-right shunt, COPD, and positive pressure ventilation.
	- **PAWP < LVEDP**: Occurs in left ventricular failure, raised intrathoracic pressure, decreased left ventricular compliance, and aortic regurgitation.
### Pulmonary Zones of West

**Zone 1: P_A > P_a > P_c**

- **Description**: Alveolar pressure (P_A) is greater than both arterial pressure (P_a) and capillary pressure (P_c).
- **PA Catheter**: The PA catheter tip wedged here will measure only alveolar pressure.

**Zone 2: P_a > P_A > P_c**

- **Description**: Arterial pressure (P_a) is greater than alveolar pressure (P_A), but alveolar pressure is greater than capillary (pulmonary venous) pressure (P_c).
- **PA Catheter**: The PA catheter tip will still only measure alveolar pressure here.

**Zone 3: P_a > P_c > P_A**

- **Description**: Arterial pressure (P_a) is greater than capillary pressure (P_c), and capillary pressure is greater than alveolar pressure (P_A). A column of blood extends from the right atrium to the left atrium, unlike in Zone 1 or Zone 2.

## Cardiac Output Measurement

### Indicator Dilution Method
- **History**: Proposed by Stewart in 1890 and refined by Hamilton.
- **Principle**: Involves upstream injection of a known amount of a substance and downstream measurement of its concentration over time, producing an indicator dilution curve.
- **Indicator**: Historically used indocyanine green.
- **Stewart-Hamilton Equation**:
![](Pasted%20image%2020240707120421.png)
  
  - **CO**: Cardiac output (l/min)
  - **I**: Amount of dye injected (mg)
  - **cm**: Mean indicator concentration (mg/l)
  - **t**: Total curve duration (s)
  - **K**: Calibration factor

### Thermodilution Method
- **Principle**: Uses temperature change as the indicator based on the same dilution principles.
- **Procedure**:
  - A cold or room temperature solution is injected rapidly.
  - Temperature change is measured at the thermistor bead in the distal Pulmonary Artery Catheter (PAC).
  - The time-temperature curve's area is inversely proportional to cardiac output.
- **Curve Characteristics**:
  - **Normal Curve**: Sharp upstroke followed by a smooth return to baseline.
  - **Increased Cardiac Output**: Steeper and shorter curve.
  - **Low Cardiac Output**: Slurred curve with delayed peak and slower return to baseline.
  - **Tricuspid Regurgitation**: Exaggerated curve due to recirculation of injectate.
- **Simplified Stewart-Hamilton Equation**:

![](Pasted%20image%2020240707120435.png)

  - **CO**: Cardiac output (l/min)
  - **V**: Injected volume
  - **Tb**: Blood temperature
  - **Ti**: Injectate temperature
  - **K1** and **K2**: Corrections for specific heat and gravity of injectate and blood
  - **A**: Area under the curve (change in blood temperature over time)
- **Procedure for Accuracy**:
  - Injectate should be bolused rapidly at the end of expiration.
  - Measurements should be averaged over a minimum of three trials.
  - Very cold injectate (0-4ºC) is more accurate but may cause bradycardia; room temperature injectate is safer.

## Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation (SvO2)
- **Measurement**: Performed on a sample from the distal lumen of the PAC.
- **Comparison**: Distinct from central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), which is from the superior vena cava (SVC).
- **Clinical Implications**:
  - SvO2 indicates oxygen delivery and extraction.
  - **High SvO2**: Seen in sepsis, hepatic failure, wedged PAC, high FiO2, decreased oxygen demand.
  - **Low SvO2**: Seen in multiorgan failure, anemia, increased oxygen demand, cardiac arrest.
- **Utility**: Routine monitoring is of limited clinical use due to variable clinical contexts.
