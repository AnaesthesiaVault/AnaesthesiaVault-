# Whole Lung Lavage

## Definition

Whole lung lavage is a therapeutic procedure that involves the irrigation of the lung and bronchial tree. It is primarily used to treat conditions such as:

- Alveolar proteinosis
- Radioactive dust inhalation
- Cystic fibrosis
- Bronchiectasis
- Asthmatic bronchitis

The procedure is performed under general anesthesia using a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) to allow for ventilation of one lung while the other lung is treated with lavage fluid.

## Approach

## Complications

- **Spillage of Lavage Fluid:**
	
	- Can occur from the treated lung to the ventilated lung.
	- Managed by stopping lavage and ensuring functional separation of the lungs before continuing.
	- Use a stethoscope over the ventilated lung to check for rales indicating leakage.
	- Spillage can cause profound hypoxemia, possibly necessitating termination of the procedure and maintaining two-lung ventilation with oxygen and PEEP.
- **Hypoxemia:**
	
	- During fluid instillation into the dependent lung, oxygenation may improve due to increased intra-alveolar pressure diverting blood flow to the ventilated lung.
	- Hypoxemia may occur when fluid is drained from the dependent lung.
	- Severe hypoxemia during right lung lavage can be mitigated by inflating a balloon-tipped catheter in the right main pulmonary artery to minimize blood flow to the non-ventilated lung during drainage. This technique carries a risk of pulmonary artery rupture and is reserved for high-risk patients.

## Limitations

- The size limitations of available DLTs preclude their use in patients weighing less than 40 kg.
- In such cases, cardiopulmonary bypass may be required to provide oxygenation during lavage.
