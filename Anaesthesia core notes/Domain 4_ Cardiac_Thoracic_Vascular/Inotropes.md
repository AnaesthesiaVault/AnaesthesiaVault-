# Shock

## Overview

**Formula to Remember:** BP = PVR x SV x HR
## Types of Shock and Treatments

### Cardiogenic Shock

- **Primary Problem:** ↓ SV due to ↓ contractility
- **Key Intervention:** Need to ↑ contractility and ↑ PVR

**Inotropes:**
- **Dobutamine**
  - **Explanation:**
	- Strong cardiac β1 agonist
	- Stronger β1 agonist than β2 (inotrope > vasodilator)
	- ↑ Force of power stroke in cardiac myocytes
	- ↑ Contractility (strength of myocyte contraction)
	- ↑ Stroke Volume

### Distributive Shock

- **Primary Problem:** ↓ PVR (profoundly abnormal vasodilation)
- **Key Intervention:** Need to ↑ PVR

**Vasoconstrictors:**
- **Norepinephrine**
  - **Explanation:**
	- Strong α1 agonist > vasoconstriction
	- Moderate cardiac β1 agonist > ↑ contractility & SV, CO (inotropic & HR)
- **Epinephrine**
  - **Explanation:**
	- Strong α1 agonist > vasoconstriction
	- Strong cardiac β1 agonist > ↑ contractility & HR (inotropic & chronotropic)
	- Strong β2 agonist > Bronchodilation (useful to treat anaphylaxis)

### Hypovolemic Shock

- **Primary Problem:** ↓ SV due to ↓ Preload
- **Key Intervention:** Need to restore intravascular volume

**Fluids:**
- **Crystalloids:** 2L bolus
  - **Explanation:**
	- If ineffective at restoring BP, consider vasoconstrictors to ↑ PVR
	- Change to blood products if needed:
	  - RBCs to restore O2 carrying capacity
	  - FFP to restore blood volume & clotting factors

### Obstructive Shock

- **Primary Problem:** Extrinsic compression of heart > ↓ preload, ↓ SV
- **Key Intervention:** Need to relieve obstruction

**Interventions:**
- **Intravascular:**
  - PE: Thrombolytics to destroy embolus
  - Valvular: Mechanical valve obstruction - OR stat
- **Extracardiac:**
  - Tamponade: Pericardiocentesis to drain effusion
  - Tension pneumothorax: Needle decompression/chest tube to remove intrapleural air
# Inotropes

## Definitions of Cardiac Agents

### Inotrope
- An agent that alters the force or energy of muscular contractions.
- **Positive Inotropes:** Increase the strength of muscular contractions.
- **Negative Inotropes:** Weaken the force of muscular contractions.
- Commonly refers to positive inotropes.

### Chronotrope
- An agent or substance that alters the rate of a regularly recurring phenomenon, specifically related to heart rate in cardiac physiology.

### Lusitrope
- An agent that relaxes the function of cardiac muscles and chambers.

#### Dromotrope
- An agent that affects the conduction speed in the AV node and thus the rate of electrical impulses.

#### Vasopressor
- An agent that causes constriction of blood vessels.

### Additional Terms
- **Catecholamine:** Monoamine neurotransmitter.
- **Sympathomimetics:** Stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.

## Production

- Endogenous catecholamines are synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine (derived from phenylalanine), forming L-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in a rate-limiting step.
- L-DOPA is converted to dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, which act at dopaminergic and adrenergic receptors respectively. Dopamine has paracrine and endocrine functions, suppressing the central release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin, acting on dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CETZ), and regulating vascular tone in renal and other specialized vascular beds.
- Noradrenaline is the neurotransmitter involved in signalling at most sympathetic nerve terminal synapses.
  - The long postganglionic sympathetic neurons have varicosities along the terminal branches filled with synaptic vesicles that synthesize and release noradrenaline.
  - When an action potential reaches the terminal synapse, voltage-gated calcium channels open, rapidly increasing local intracellular calcium concentrations, leading to vesicle fusion with the cell wall and exocytosis of noradrenaline into the synaptic cleft. Noradrenaline release also creates an autoinhibitory feedback mechanism via presynaptic alpha-2 receptors.
- Adrenaline is synthesized and stored in the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and functions as a hormone acting on distal targets following activation of the sympathetic nervous system. It is the main regulator of the “fight or flight” response.

## Metabolism and Administration

- Endogenous catecholamines have short half-lives (around a minute) due to diffusion away from their sites of action and efficient metabolism by one of two enzymatic pathways.
- Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) is present in high concentrations in nerve terminals, whereas Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase (COMT) degradation occurs in the liver and kidneys.
- Both transformations usually occur, producing vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) from adrenaline and noradrenaline, and homovanillic acid from dopamine.
- Due to the short half-life and efficient metabolism, adrenaline and noradrenaline are normally given by continuous infusion at a dose range of 0.01–0.5 µg/kg/min, and dopamine started around 1–5 µg/kg/min.
- Titration of doses should occur according to clinical effect, aiming to achieve a pre-determined target, for example, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of around 60 mmHg. Extravasation can cause tissue necrosis, so infusions are given via central venous catheters in all but emergency situations. Adrenaline doses above 1 µg/kg/min are unlikely to produce additional benefit, as all receptors are maximally occupied.
- Adequacy of circulating cortisol levels, desensitization, and downregulation of receptors may be more important factors in these poor responders.

## Receptors

- Catecholamines act via cell membrane G protein-coupled receptors in various tissues, including three β-adrenoceptor subtypes and two main α-adrenoceptor subtypes, further differentiated into three subclasses (α1A, α1B, α1D, and α2A, α2B, α2C).
- There are at least five subtypes of dopamine receptors, but these are more easily considered as D1-like or D2-like.
- When a catecholamine binds to the peptide chain of the receptor, a conformational change in the G protein initiates the production of a second messenger: inositol triphosphate (IP3) in α1, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in β receptors.
- This ultimately leads to an increase in intracellular calcium and a subsequent effect determined by the cell type. The exception is the inhibitory α2 G protein, where stimulation causes a drop in cAMP and intracellular calcium levels.

Typically an add-on vasopressor in septic shock when an additional agent is required to raise MAP or target and occasionally an alternative first-line agent if norepinephrine is contraindicated. Increases heart rate; may induce tachyarrhythmias and ischemia. For inotropy, doses in the higher end of the suggested range is needed. Elevates lactate concentrations during initial administration (e.g., may preclude use of lactate clearance goal); may decrease mesenteric perfusion. Must be diluted (e.g., usual concentration is 1 mg in 250 mL of D5W or NS for mcg/min programs).                                   |
| **Phenylephrine**                            | 40 to 160 mcg/minute until stabilized (alternatively, 0.5 to 2 mcg/kg/minute) | 20 to 400 mcg/minute (0.25 to 5 mcg/kg/minute) | 8 to 730 mcg/minute (0.1 to 9.1 mcg/kg/minute)                                                 | Pure alpha adrenergic vasoconstrictor. May be considered when tachyarrhythmias preclude use of norepinephrine. Alternative vasopressor for patients with septic shock with (1) adequate intravascular volume (2) mild to moderate hypotension, and (3) low risk for tachyarrhythmias. Less effective than norepinephrine for raising MAP in septic shock. Lower doses (e.g., 1 to 3 mcg/kg/minute) should not be used for protective effect and can cause hypotension during weaning. Must be diluted (e.g., usual concentration is 10 mg in 250 mL D5W or NS [40 mcg/mL] or 100 mg in 250 mL D5W or NS [400 mcg/mL]); use of commercially available pre-diluted solution is preferred. |
| **Dopamine**                                 | 2 to 5 mcg/kg/minute                                                          | 2 to 20 mcg/kg/minute                          | 20 mcg/kg/minute                                                                               | Alternative to norepinephrine in septic shock in highly selected patients (e.g., with absolute or relative bradycardia and a low risk of tachyarrhythmias). More adverse effects (e.g., tachycardia, arrhythmias) particularly at doses >20 mcg/kg/minute and less effective than norepinephrine for reversing hypotension in septic shock. Lower doses (e.g., 1 to 3 mcg/kg/minute) should not be used for protective effect and can cause hypotension during weaning. Must be diluted (e.g., usual concentration is 400 mg in 250 mL D5W [1.6 mg/mL] or 800 mg in 250 mL D5W [3.2 mg/mL]); use of commercially available pre-diluted solution is preferred.                           |

Not recommended as a replacement for first-line vasopressor. Pure vasoconstrictor; may decrease stroke volume and cardiac output in myocardial dysfunction or precipitate ischemia in coronary artery disease. Must be diluted (e.g., usual concentration is 20 units in 250 mL D5W or NS [0.1 units/mL]).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Increases cardiac contractility and modestly increases heart rate at high doses. May cause peripheral vasodilation, hypotension, and/or ventricular arrhythmias. Renally cleared; dose adjustment in renal impairment needed. Must be diluted (e.g., usual concentration is 40 mg in 200 mL D5W [200 mcg/mL]); use of commercially available pre-diluted solution is preferred.                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Naturally Occurring

#### Dopamine
- Acts both directly and indirectly.
- The absence of functional groups on the ethylamine sidechain allows it to enter sympathetic nerve terminals and displace noradrenaline from storage vesicles, causing an adrenergic effect, as long as noradrenaline stores have not been depleted.
- Direct function (at doses around 5 µg/kg/min) is via binding to dopamine receptors. Dopamine’s structure does not give it great affinity for α and β receptors, but at doses up to 10-20 µg/kg/min, β1 receptors may be stimulated, causing increased heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output.
- At even higher doses (>20 µg/kg/min), α effects predominate, with peripheral vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance and venous return.
- Dopamine is described as a general inotrope-vasopressor, but its wide and unpredictable dosage range, as well as reliance on indirect mechanisms of action, usually make it a suboptimal choice of inotrope. It is a potent emetogenic, suppresses prolactin release (impairing immunity) and TSH release.
- The “renoprotective” benefit of dopamine has been disproven, despite its continued use in certain centers. Urine output in these patients likely increased due to the diuretic effect of dopamine (inhibiting renal tubular reabsorption of sodium), rather than improved renal perfusion. Dopamine may cause maldistribution of blood flow from the renal medulla to the cortex and may worsen renal outcomes.

#### Noradrenaline
- Differs from dopamine by the addition of a single hydroxyl group on the ethylamine sidechain, making it a direct-acting drug with a high affinity for α receptors and moderate affinity for β1 receptors, without much β2 effect.
- This makes it a potent vasoconstrictor via α1 agonism (and lack of β2 vasodilatation) as well as a mild inotrope via a moderate β1 effect.
- It is the agent of choice in states of distributive shock, such as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis. It is available in South Africa but can be complicated to obtain for routine clinical use.

#### Adrenaline
- Formed from noradrenaline, with the addition of a methyl group on the terminal amine, greatly increasing affinity for both β1 and β2 receptors.
- At lower doses it acts predominantly as a β agonist and inotrope, with some vasopressor action. At higher doses (around 1 µg/kg/min) the α1 vasopressor activity dominates, but is not as potent as noradrenaline, due to the offset vasodilation via β2 activity.
- Adrenaline is readily available and in common use globally. Its positive chronotropic and inotropic action increases cardiac workload, and together with additional arrhythmogenicity, it may put patients with ischemic heart disease at risk.
- Plasma glucose is raised by stimulating glycogenolysis, lipolysis, and gluconeogenesis, and may also be affected by changes in insulin secretion (increased by β2, but overridden by α effects).
- Although it is a significant vasopressor, lactate rise is usually due to increased glycolytic flux rather than vasoconstriction and anaerobic metabolism.
- Adrenaline is recommended at a dose of 1 mg every 2-4 minutes as part of the resuscitation guidelines in cardiac arrest, functioning as a pure vasopressor intended to direct blood supply to vital organs.

### Synthetic

#### Isoprenaline
- It is a pure β agonist and was favored for its chronotropy (useful in chemical pacing of bradycardias and denervated hearts) and inotrope-vasodilator action (useful postoperatively in pediatric cardiac patients unable to tolerate increased afterload).

#### Dobutamine
- Resembles dopamine but has a large hydrocarbon tail which ensures it is direct-acting and increases β receptor selectivity. It was designed to be a pure β agonist and has been termed an “inodilator” due to the inotropic effect at β1 receptors, combined with the afterload-reducing vasodilatory effect of β2 receptor stimulation in the skeletal muscle vascular beds.
- It also increases atrioventricular conduction and may precipitate arrhythmias or increase the ventricular response rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. It is used in the treatment of low cardiac output states in heart failure and cardiac surgery, at a dose range of 1–20 µg/kg/min. It can also be used for cardiac stress testing as an alternative to exercise.

#### Phenylephrine
- Is not a catecholamine, due to the loss of a hydroxyl group from the benzene ring, but otherwise looks identical to adrenaline.
- This relatively minor structural change prevents it from binding at β receptors, and it is a pure α agonist, causing an increase in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.
- It is far less potent than adrenaline and must be given in 10-fold higher doses (50–100 µg boluses intravenously).
- Degradation by COMT is also less effective, meaning the duration of action is longer. It should be used with caution, or not at all, in the setting of relative bradycardia or decreased inotropic states, where a β agonist should be considered to avoid precipitating acute cardiac failure.

#### Ephedrine
- Is a naturally occurring stimulant in Ephedra plants, but is manufactured synthetically for clinical use.
- The absence of hydroxyl groups means that it is lipid-soluble enough to enter neurons and act indirectly by releasing noradrenaline, its major mechanism of action. It is far less potent as a direct agonist, and 1000-fold doses are required, also leading to rapid depletion of stored noradrenaline.
- It is not degraded by MAO or COMT and therefore has a longer duration of action.
- Ephedrine causes a mild increase in inotropy and vasoconstriction when given in intravenous boluses of 5–10 mg.
- It may become ineffective after repeated doses or in patients in whom noradrenaline stores are depleted.

#### Amphetamines
- Also have a benzene ring with no hydroxyl group, are highly lipid-soluble and penetrate the blood-brain barrier with ease.
- Although they have no direct adrenoreceptor effect, they displace catecholamines from neuronal storage vesicles and can cause central release of large amounts of catecholamines. Originally developed as medication for appetite suppression and mood disorder, they have subsequently mostly become drugs of abuse.

#### Phosphodiesterase (PDE) Inhibitors
- Positive inotropes that are not dependent on adrenoceptor activation, as they increase the intracellular action of cAMP and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by preventing their degradation.
- This may be particularly useful in cardiac failure when downregulation of β receptors has occurred.
- The selective PDE III inhibitor milrinone allows accumulation of cAMP in the cardiac myocyte, increasing cardiac contractility, enhancing left ventricular relaxation, and improving early ventricular filling.
- Conversely, in smooth muscle, increased cAMP prevents calcium release and promotes smooth muscle relaxation and reduced peripheral and pulmonary vascular resistance.

#### Digoxin
- Causes a modest increase in contractility by reversibly binding to Na+-K+-ATPase in the cardiac myocyte, which leads to increased availability of intracellular calcium and increased contractility.

#### Levosimendan
- Is a myocardial calcium sensitizer and inodilator, which improves contractility without increasing intracellular calcium or cAMP, and thereby doesn’t increase myocardial oxygen demand.
