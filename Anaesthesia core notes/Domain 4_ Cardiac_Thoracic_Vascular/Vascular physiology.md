# Systemic Circulation
- The systemic circulation is a ‘pressure-constant, flow-variable’ system.
- A ‘pump’, the left ventricle (LV), drives blood through the vessels.
- The arterial system consists of arteries and arterioles.
- Capillaries facilitate exchange.
- The venous system consists of venules and veins.

**Distribution of Circulating Blood Volume:**
- Arterial system: 15%
- Venous system: 65%
- Pulmonary circulation: 10%
- Cardiac chambers: 5%
- Capillaries: 5%
## Blood Flow and Velocity

### Blood Velocity and Flow

V=Q'/A

	- V (cm/s): blood velocity (distance travelled per unit time)

	- Q˙​ (mL/s): blood flow (volume of blood passing a point per unit time)

	- A (cm2): cross-sectional area of the vessel

**Example:**

- Aortic cross-sectional area: 4 cm<sup>2</sup>
- Mean blood velocity in the aorta: 20 cm/s
- Therefore, typical aortic blood flow: 80 cm<sup>3</sup> (i.e., 80 mL/s)
- At a heart rate (HR) of 60 bpm, there is one cardiac cycle per second, resulting in a stroke volume (SV) of 80 mL.
### Blood Flow Dynamics

- As blood passes along the arterial system, large arteries branch into smaller arteries, which further branch into arterioles. Although the cross-sectional area of each individual blood vessel decreases as its radius decreases, the overall cross-sectional area summed over all vessels at a given level of bifurcation increases dramatically.
- **Total Blood Flow:** Remains constant as the overall cross-sectional area increases.
- **Capillaries to Veins:** As blood moves from capillaries to venules and then to veins, the cross-sectional area of each individual vessel increases, but the total cross-sectional area decreases. Ultimately, veins from the lower half of the body combine to form the inferior vena cava (IVC), and veins from the upper half form the superior vena cava (SVC).
- **Blood Flow to Right Atrium:** The blood flow entering the right atrium approximately equals cardiac output (CO), accounting for some fluid filtered into the interstitial space and carried away by the lymphatics.
### Distant Factors

- **Direct sympathetic tone:** Does not affect denervated free flaps.
- **Humoral factors:**
	- Catecholamine release from adrenals and sympathetic nerve endings.
	- Vasopressin and angiotensin.
### Local Factors

- **Myogenic response:** Low hydrostatic pressure leads to dilatation and vice versa.
- **Metabolic factors:** Vasodilatation occurs secondary to raised K<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, osmolarity, CO2​, and adenosine, and reduced PO2​.
### Rheology

- Deformability of RBC and haematocrit (Hct).
- Factors described by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation.
## Arterial System

### Hagen–Poiseuille Equation

ΔP=8Q˙​ηl​/ πr<sup>4</sup>

- ΔP: pressure drop along the tube
- Q˙​: flow
- η: viscosity
- l: tube length
- r: radius
Rearranged form:
Q˙=ΔPπr<sup>4</sup>/8ηl
### Darcy's Law

Pressure equals flow times resistance.

Hence, if ΔP is pressure and Q˙ is flow, then resistance to flow is 8ηl/πr<sup>4</sup>

### Important Considerations

- The most important factor affecting flow is the tube radius.
- Hagen–Poiseuille equation provides only an approximation of blood flow due to:
	- Pressure drop along the vessel is not continuous; it has a pulsatile component.
	- Blood does not behave like a Newtonian fluid (blood viscosity varies with temperature and Hct).
	- **Fahraeus–Lindqvist effect:** In small vessels, RBCs stream towards the centre, leaving plasma at the walls. Plasma has lower viscosity than whole blood, reducing resistance to flow, opposing the tendency for resistance to increase as vessel radius decreases, especially in arterioles and capillaries.
	- Vessels are not uniform rigid tubes: Large vessels are distensible; an increase in pressure causes an increase in vessel radius, reducing resistance and increasing flow.
	- **Myogenic autoregulation:** Intrinsic ability of an arteriole to maintain constant blood flow despite changes in intraluminal pressure.
### Arteriole Function

- Pulsatile blood flow is damped, becoming continuous flow by the time the blood reaches the capillaries.
1. Control of blood flow distribution to different organs by altering organ vascular resistance.
2. Control of total systemic vascular resistance (SVR).
3. Alteration of capillary hydrostatic pressure, effectively controlling bulk flow of water between intravascular and interstitial fluid compartments.

# Arterial Pressure Wave Forms

![[image-160-x38-y42.png]]

- It is the arterial pressure wave that is felt as the ‘radial pulse’, not the blood flow wave (pressure wave moves much faster than the blood flow)
**As you move more distal:**
- The arterial upstroke is steeper and SBP is increased. DBP is decreased. MAP is constant
- Dicrotic notch changes: The dicrotic notch is positioned further down the pressure curve. Rather than being a sharp interruption in the pressure descent, the dicrotic notch becomes more of a dicrotic wave.
![[image-161-x20-y517.png]]
## Characteristic Waveforms

![[image-161-x25-y335.png]]

# Myocardial Contractility

- The slope of the waveform upstroke reflects myocardial contractility.
- An increased upstroke gradient suggests greater pressure generated per unit time.
- A reduced upstroke gradient may be seen in aortic stenosis.
# Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)

- The downstroke of the arterial pressure waveform provides information about SVR:
	- A steep downstroke with a low dicrotic notch indicates a low SVR, resulting in a thin and pointed arterial waveform.
	- A high dicrotic notch implies a high SVR.
# Windkessel Effect

- The elastic aortic walls expand to accommodate the stroke volume (SV), moderating the increase in intra-aortic pressure from a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 80 mmHg to a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 120 mmHg.
- The ejected blood possesses kinetic energy, and there is storage of potential energy in the stretched aortic wall.
- During diastole, the recoil of the aortic wall converts stored potential energy back into kinetic energy, maintaining the onward flow of blood and thereby maintaining DBP.
**Loss of Windkessel Effect with Ageing:**
- With advancing age, elastin in the aortic wall degenerates, reducing compliance.
- The aorta's ability to accommodate SV without a large pressure increase diminishes, contributing to the development of systolic hypertension in the elderly.
# Capillaries

## Functional Anatomy

- Capillaries deliver nutrients to and remove metabolites from tissues.
- They help distribute body water between intravascular and interstitial fluid compartments.
- The capillary wall, composed entirely of endothelium and supported by a basement membrane, is only one cell thick.
## Capillary–Tissue Exchange

### Simple Diffusion

- Gases (e.g., O2​, CO2) and small lipophilic molecules (e.g., anaesthetic agents) diffuse.
- Diffusion rate is primarily determined by partial pressure gradients (Fick's law of diffusion).
### Bulk Flow

- Water is filtered, and dissolved solutes (electrolytes) can be dragged along with it.
### Pinocytosis

- This energy-consuming process involves substances in the capillary lumen being enveloped by the endothelial cell membrane to form a vesicle for transport.
- It contributes minimally to capillary–tissue exchange.
## Starling Law

### Forces Influencing Fluid Movement

- **Forces moving fluid out of the capillary:**
	
	- Capillary hydrostatic pressure Pc​ (Arterial: 36 mmHg; Venous: 10 mmHg)
	- Interstitial fluid oncotic pressure πi​ (3 mmHg)
- **Forces moving fluid into the capillary:**
	
	- Interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure Pi​ (2 mmHg)
	- Plasma oncotic pressure πc(24 mmHg)
### Starling Filtration Equation

Net fluid filtration across capillary wall=Kf​[(Pc​−Pi​)−σ(πc​−πi​)]

- Kf is the filtration coefficient, a constant related to the permeability of the capillary wall (high Kf indicates high water-permeability, whilst low Kf indicates low water-permeability)
- σ is the reflection coefficient, a constant that represents the permeability of the capillary to proteins (σ = 1 implies that the capillary wall is 100% impermeable)
- Capillary walls normally impermeable to proteins and formula can be simplify as: (Pc–Pi)–(πc–πi).
- Pi; πc; πi usually constant. Pc is therefore the main determinant of whether fluid is filtered or reabsorbed
### Normal Conditions

- **Arterial (Filtration):**

	Net filtration pressure=(36−2)−(24−3)=13 mmHg

	- There is bulk flow out of the capillary (filtration).
- **Venous (Absorption):**

	Net filtration pressure=(10−2)−(24−3)=−13 mmHg

### Different Organs

![[image-165-x28-y75.png]]

- **Autotransfusion in haemorrhage:**
500 mL of fluid can be mobilized within 30 min from the interstitial space to the intravascular space. Reduced Cp and net absorption
# Endothelium

## Functions

### 1. Transfer

- Controls the movement of gases, nutrients, and metabolites across the capillary.
### 2. Synthesis of Vasoactive Substances

- **Vasodilators:** Nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin (PGI2​)
- **Vasoconstrictor:** Endothelin (ET)
### 3. Haemostasis

- **Anticoagulants:**
	- Endothelial cell surface receptor thrombomodulin binds thrombin. The thrombomodulin–thrombin complex activates protein C, a potent anticoagulant.
	- NO and PGI2​ inhibit platelet aggregation.
	- Heparin sulphate activates the plasma protein antithrombin III, which inactivates thrombin and factor Xa.
- **Coagulants:**
	- von Willebrand factor (vWF) binds to factor VIII and activates platelets.
### 4. Inflammation

- Interleukin 1 and tissue necrosis factor stimulate the endothelium to express adhesion molecules, attracting neutrophils and lymphocytes.
# Venous System

## Functions

### 1. Storage of Blood

- The venous system is 30 times more compliant than the arterial system, containing 65% of blood volume.
### 2. Venous Return to the Heart

#### Mechanism

1. **Valves**
	- One-way valves positioned every few centimetres along the vein.
2. **Venous Pressure (Systemic Filling Pressure)**
	- Increased venous pressure from filling the veins with a greater blood volume or increased venous tone through increased sympathetic nervous activity enhances venous return.
3. **Respiratory (or Abdominothoracic) Pump**
	- **Spontaneously Breathing Inspiration:** Negative intrathoracic pressure pulls open the distensible venae cavae, reducing resistance to flow. Increased intra-abdominal pressure propels blood towards the heart, increasing venous return.
	- **Positive-Pressure Ventilation Inspiration:** Increases intrathoracic pressure, reducing venous return, right ventricular preload, and cardiac output (CO).
4. **Cardiac Pump**
	- During ventricular contraction, the fibrous atrioventricular (AV) rings are pulled downwards, increasing atrial volume and decreasing atrial pressure, aiding blood flow from the venae cavae and pulmonary veins.
5. **Skeletal Muscle Pump**
	- Rhythmical contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle, especially in the calf, propels blood through deep veins.
6. **Body Position**
	- Venous pressure increases in the supine position, enhancing venous return.
### 3. Thermoregulation

## Resistance to Flow

- **Hagen–Poiseuille Equation:** Resistance to flow=8ηl/πr4
- **Shape of the Lumen with Intraluminal Pressure:**
	- High intraluminal pressure: Circular lumen, less resistance.
	- Low intraluminal pressure: Elliptical lumen, more resistance.
	- Intraluminal pressure decreases along the venous system: Venules: 10–15 mmHg; veins: 4–8 mmHg; inferior vena cava (IVC): 0–2 mmHg. Venules, therefore, have a circular lumen, providing minimal resistance to blood flow. A collapsed IVC can significantly increase flow resistance.
## CVP Waveform

- Normal CVP: 2–8 mmHg
### Components

- **a wave:** Increase in pressure during right atrial contraction.
- **c wave:** Coincides with carotid pulsation. During early systole, right ventricular contraction causes the tricuspid valve to bulge into the right atrium, leading to a small increase in CVP.
- **x descent:** Atrial relaxation and downward movement of the right atrium during right ventricular contraction, leading to rapid right atrial filling.
- **v wave:** Continued venous return to the right atrium during ventricular systole; right atrial filling with a closed tricuspid valve.
- **y descent:** Decrease in CVP after the tricuspid valve opens, allowing blood flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle.
### Abnormal Shapes

- **Atrial Fibrillation (AF):** Loss of a waves.
- **Third-degree Heart Block:** Independent atrial and ventricular contraction results in occasional large a waves ('cannon a waves') when atria contract with a closed tricuspid valve.
- **Tricuspid Regurgitation:** Ventricular systole ejects blood into the right atrium, increasing CVP. The CVP waveform has a ‘giant v wave’, replacing the c wave, x descent, and v wave.

# Physiological Changes in Haemorrhage

1. **Fall in Circulating Volume and Reduced Preload**
	- Fall in cardiac output (CO) results in decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP).
	- Organ perfusion pressure falls, leading to organ dysfunction. The cardiovascular, nervous, and endocrine systems act to redistribute blood flow to vital organs, namely the brain, the heart, and, to a lesser extent, the kidneys.
## 3 Stages
### Immediate

- **Duration:** Seconds
- **Mechanisms:** Cardiovascular reflexes
	- Detected by low-pressure mechanoreceptors in the right atrium and arterial baroreceptors of the carotid sinus and aortic arch.
	- Vasomotor centre increases sympathetic outflow, resulting in tachycardia and increased myocardial contractility.
	- Heart rate (HR) increases in proportion to the degree of blood loss.
	- Generalized arteriolar vasoconstriction. Initial fall in blood flow to the kidney, brain, and heart, but quick recovery to near normal due to autoregulation.
	- Dramatic fall in blood flow to the skin, gut, and skeletal muscle; anaerobic metabolism results in lactic acid production. Fall in arterial pH stimulates the respiratory centre (through the carotid bodies), leading to tachypnoea. Severe hypotension further activates the respiratory centre.
	- Venoconstriction of the capacitance veins reduces compliance, restoring venous return to the heart despite the reduction in total blood volume.
### Early

- **Duration:** Minutes to hours
- **Transcapillary Refill/Autotransfusion**
	- Arteriolar vasoconstriction decreases capillary hydrostatic pressure, altering the balance of Starling filtration forces, leading to interstitial fluid reabsorption into the capillaries.
	- Increased plasma glucose concentration through sympathetic nervous system-mediated glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver. Raised glucose concentration causes plasma to have a greater osmotic pressure, drawing water from the extracellular space (greater effect than autotransfusion).
- **Renal Conservation of Sodium and Water**
	- Reduced renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
	- Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).
- **Inhibition of Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)**
	- Decreased stretch of the atrial and ventricular walls reduces ANP and BNP secretion, which ordinarily promote sodium and water excretion.
- **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)**
	- Acts as a vasopressor, augmenting noradrenaline-mediated arteriolar vasoconstriction.
	- Increases water reabsorption and stimulates thirst.
- **Cortisol**
	- Promotes sodium and water reabsorption and gluconeogenesis.
### Late

- **Plasma Volume Restoration**
	- Over the next 2 days, plasma volume is restored by oral intake of water and renal reabsorption of electrolytes.
	- Only water and electrolytes are returned to normal; blood has a reduced haematocrit and plasma protein concentration.
	- The liver rapidly synthesizes albumin, restoring plasma albumin concentration to normal within 4–6 days.
	- Restoration of red blood cell (RBC) mass takes much longer. Erythropoietin (EPO) is released from the kidney in response to hypoxia, activating erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. Haemoglobin (Hb) concentration usually returns to normal within 8 weeks, provided sufficient iron is available.
### Decompensated Shock

- **Characteristics**
	- Extensive (>30%) and rapid blood loss without treatment leads to the failure of compensatory mechanisms to restore MAP, resulting in decompensated haemorrhage.
	- Reflects the change from stressed blood volume (contributing to vessel wall stretching) to unstressed blood volume (simply fills the vessel lumen).
	- Characterized by paradoxical vasodilatation and decrease in tachycardia, leading to myocardial ischaemia and cardiac depression, resulting in a rapid fall in MAP.
	- Mechanism for paradoxical vasodilatation remains unclear, though some studies implicate endogenous opioids in the pathophysiology.

## Haemorrhagic Shock Classification

|                                  | Class 1 | Class 2  | Class 3   | Class 4     |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| **Blood loss (%)**               | <15     | 15–30    | 30–40     | >40%        |
| **Blood loss (mL, 70 kg adult)** | <750    | 750–1500 | 1500–2000 | >2000       |
| **HR (bpm)**                     | <100    | >100     | >120      | >140        |

Class 1 and 2 haemorrhagic shock are referred to as compensated shock, where blood pressure is maintained. Class 3 and 4 haemorrhagic shock are decompensated, characterized by hypotension. Decompensated shock is associated with >50% mortality.

**Note**: 'Pure' haemorrhagic shock is unusual. Haemorrhage usually occurs in conjunction with trauma. Following trauma, tissue damage triggers a cascade of inflammatory mediators, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ dysfunction, further increasing mortality.
