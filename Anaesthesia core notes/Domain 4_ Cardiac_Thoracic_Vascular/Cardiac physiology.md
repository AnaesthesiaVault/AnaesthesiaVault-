# Basic Physiology

## Cardiac Function

- **Right Side:** Flow
- **Left Side:** Pressure
- **Endocrine Function:**
	- **Regulation of Plasma Volume:** Stretch receptors in the cardiac atria and ventricles sense increases in plasma volume, secreting atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in response.
	- **Effect on Kidneys:** ANP and BNP work on the kidneys to produce diuresis.
## Anatomy

- **Layers of the Heart:**
	- **Epicardium:** Outermost layer
	- **Pericardial Fluid:** Between the epicardium and pericardium
	- **Pericardium:** Encloses the pericardial fluid and heart
	- **Myocardium:** Middle layer composed of cardiac muscle
		- Arranged in networks of striated cardiac muscle cells joined together by intercalated discs
	- **Endocardium:** Innermost layer
		- Layer of epithelial cells in contact with blood
		- Continuous with the endothelial layer of the blood vessels
## Functional Syncytium

- **Cardiac Muscle Coupling:**
	- Electrically
	- Chemically
	- Mechanically
# Coronary Circulation

## Overview

- **Diffusion Limitation:**
	- Ventricular wall is too thick for effective diffusion of O2 to occur; only the endocardium is nourished directly.
- **Coronary Arteries:**
	- Classified as ‘end arteries’.
## Sinuses of Valsalva and Eddy Currents

- **Anatomy:**
	- Aortic root has three dilatations just above the aortic valve, known as the aortic sinuses (or sinuses of Valsalva).
	- They produce eddy currents that keep the valve cusps away from the aortic walls, facilitating smooth valve closure.
- **Coronary Artery Origins:**
	- Left and right coronary arteries originate from the left posterior and anterior coronary sinus respectively.
	- Eddy currents prevent their occlusion.
## Coronary Arteries

![](Pasted%20image%2020240616205144.png)

## Variants

- **Left Dominance (15%):**
	- Posterior interventricular artery is not a branch of the right coronary artery, but is instead a branch of the left circumflex artery.
![[image-123-x33-y447.png]]

## Coronary Veins

- **Coronary Sinus (85%)**: Collected by the cardiac veins, which coalesce to form the coronary sinus. Opens into the right atrium (RA) between the inferior vena cava (IVC) and tricuspid valve (TV).
- **Thebesian Veins**: The smallest cardiac veins, drain directly into the four chambers of the heart. Predominantly found in the right atrium and ventricle. Contributes to physiological shunt by draining deoxygenated blood into the left ventricle (LV).
## Supply and Demand

- The resting heart receives 250 mL/min of blood, constituting 5% of the cardiac output (CO). This may increase up to five times during exercise.
- Oxygen (O2) extraction is higher in the heart (around 70% at rest) compared to other organs; in contrast, resting skeletal muscle O2 extraction is only 25%.
- High blood flow and efficient O2 extraction make the heart susceptible to ischaemia.
- **Left Ventricle (LV)**: Intermittent blood flow. Coronary arteries penetrate at right angles. During systole, arteries are forced closed by high LV pressure. Blood flow continues during diastole.
- **Right Ventricle (RV)**: Blood flow occurs throughout the cardiac cycle due to lower pressures generated in the RV.

## Factors Affecting Coronary Blood Flow

## Cardiac Output

- **Cardiac Output (CO)**: Volume of blood ejected by the left or right ventricle per minute. CO = Stroke Volume (SV) x Heart Rate (HR).
	- Normal CO: 5.25 L/min, may increase up to four times during stress.
	- Normal Cardiac Index (CI): 3–3.5 L/(min m²).
### Stroke Volume (SV)

- Volume of blood ejected from the LV per heartbeat.
- Calculation: LVEDV - LVESV (e.g., 120-50 = 70 mL for a 70 kg man).
- Normal SV: 55–100 mL. Stroke Volume Index (SVI): 33–47 mL/m² per beat.
### Ejection Fraction (EF)

- Proportion of blood ejected from the LV per heartbeat.
- Normal EF: 55–70%.
### Heart Rate (HR)

- Set by the sinoatrial (SA) node, modulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). A denervated heart has a basal HR of around 100–120 bpm.
- At rest, the Vagus nerve is tonically active, reducing HR to 60–70 bpm through acetylcholine (ACh) effects at muscarinic M2 receptors.
- During exercise, parasympathetic tone is withdrawn, increasing HR via sympathetic fibres and noradrenaline (NA) release.
- At rest, a single cardiac cycle lasts 0.8 seconds (systole 0.3 s, diastole 0.5 s).
- CO increases up to around 140 bpm; above 150 bpm, diastolic time becomes very short (~0.15 s), reducing SV and CO.
- HR below 40 bpm decreases CO despite a moderate increase in SV.
- Optimal sinus HR: 50–150 bpm.
- HRmax = 208 - (0.7 × age).
### Preload

- Intraluminal pressure stretching the right or left ventricle to its end-diastolic dimensions.
- Venous return to the right ventricle is the main determinant of LV and RV preload.
#### Starling's Law

- The force of cardiac myocyte contraction depends on the preceding diastolic length of the ventricular fibres: increased preload produces an increased SV.
- Attributed to the degree of overlap of the actin and myosin myofilaments in diastole (crossbridge formation).
- Matching of RV and LV preload: Increased venous return to the right ventricle increases its SV, resulting in greater pulmonary blood flow, LVEDV, and thus greater LV SV.
##### Length–Tension Relationship for Contractility

- **Stretch Too Far**: Fewer actin-myosin crossbridges form, reducing the force of contraction. This occurs in ventricular failure.
##### Length-Independent Mechanism

- Due to Ca²⁺ sensitive troponin muscle.
- Increased preload stretches the cardiac sarcomere, increasing the sensitivity of troponin C for Ca²⁺ ions, thus enhancing contractility.
### Contractility

- Intrinsic ability of cardiac myocytes to generate mechanical power at a given preload and afterload.
### Afterload

- Stress developed in the left ventricular wall during ejection, reflecting the force opposing the shortening of cardiac myocytes.
- Increased afterload reduces the rate and extent of sarcomere shortening, decreasing SV.
- **Why CO is Maintained with Increased Afterload**:
	1. Starling Mechanism: Less blood is ejected per beat, increasing end-systolic volume (ESV), leading to greater LVEDV and thus greater subsequent SV.
	2. Anrep Effect: Intrinsic increase in inotropy with increased afterload.
### Measurement of Cardiac Output

#### Invasive Methods

- Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC), central line, or arterial line.
#### Minimally Invasive Methods

- Oesophageal Doppler.
#### Non-Invasive Methods

- Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and bioimpedance.
#### Fick's Principle

##### Applied to Blood Flow to an Organ

- Blood flow to an organ = (Rate of uptake or excretion of substance) / (Arterio-venous concentration difference) or Q = M / (A - V).
	- **Q**: Blood flow to the organ per minute.
	- **M**: Number of moles of substance added or removed per minute.
	- **A**: Arterial concentration of the substance.
	- **V**: Venous concentration of the substance.
##### Applied to O₂

- CO (L/min) = VO₂ / {(CaO₂) - (CvO₂)}
	- **CO**: Cardiac output.
	- **VO₂**: Rate of O₂ uptake.
	- **CaO₂**: Arterial O₂ content.
	- **CvO₂**: Mixed venous O₂ content.
#### Dye Dilution Method

- Indicator dye (Indocyanine green - short half-life) is injected into PAC, and its concentration is continuously sampled at a peripheral arterial line (lithium can also be used).
- Recirculation causes a second peak; logarithmic transformation is used to analyze the area under the curve (AUC).
##### Stewart-Hamilton Equation

- CO = (amount of indicator) / (area under concentration-time graph).
#### Thermodilution

- Gold standard, no recirculation peak.
- Inflating the balloon at the tip of the PAC allows it to be 'floated' through the right atrium and right ventricle to the pulmonary artery.
- 10-15 mL of cold saline is injected through the most proximal lumen of the PAC (located in the right atrium).
- The change in pulmonary arterial blood temperature is measured by the thermistor, resulting in a temperature-time graph.
##### Modified Steward Hamilton

CO= {V(Tb-Ti) x 60} / tf(Tt-Tb)dt

Where:

- **CO** is the cardiac output (liters per minute).
- **V** is the volume of injectate (ml).
- **T_b** is the baseline blood temperature (°C).
- **T_i** is the temperature of the injectate (°C).
- **T_t** is the temperature of blood over time after injection (°C).
- **t_0** is the time at the beginning of the measurement.
- **t_f** is the time at the end of the measurement.
#### Pulse Contour Analysis

The morphology of the arterial pressure waveform is related to stroke volume (SV) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). A continuous estimate of cardiac output (CO) is produced through a computer-based algorithm.

##### Calibrated Methods: PiCCO and LiDCO

**General:** Recalibration should be performed every 8 hours or whenever major hemodynamic changes occur.
###### PiCCO

- **Setup:** Involves central venous pressure (CVP) and a thermistor-tipped arterial line, typically sited at the femoral, brachial, or axillary artery.
- **Mechanism:** CO is estimated by analyzing the arterial pressure waveform, calibrated using the transpulmonary thermodilution method. Cold saline is injected into the central line, and the resulting blood temperature change is detected at the arterial line.
- **Considerations:** This method introduces an element of error compared to the thermodilution method using a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC), as heat dissipates while the cold injectate passes through the lungs.
###### LiDCO (Lithium Dilution Cardiac Output)

- **Setup:** Requires only a standard arterial line.
- **Mechanism:** Calibrated by the lithium dilution method, where lithium chloride is injected into a peripheral or central vein. The fall in arterial concentration of lithium is measured by a lithium electrode sampling the arterial line.
- **Advantages:** Avoids errors introduced by heat dissipation.
- **Considerations:** Cannot be used in patients on therapeutic lithium. Frequent calibration results in inaccuracies. Muscle relaxants may cross-react with the lithium electrode.
##### Non-calibrated Methods: FloTrac/Vigileo and LiDCOrapid

###### FloTrac/Vigileo

- **Setup:** A specialized pressure sensor (FloTrac) is attached to a standard arterial line. The pressure transducer is connected to a Vigileo monitor, which analyses the arterial pressure waveform.
- **Mechanism:** It is not externally calibrated; instead, it estimates aortic vascular compliance based on population demographics and the patient’s age, height, gender, and weight.
- **Correlation:** Shows good correlation with PAC thermodilution methods.
- **Limitations:** Not suitable for use in conditions with overor under-damped arterial line traces, cardiac arrhythmias, aortic regurgitation, or the presence of an intra-aortic balloon pump.
#### Oesophageal Doppler (CardioQ)

V= (c x Delta f)/ (2 x f0 x cos)

##### Doppler Equation
- **v** is the blood flow velocity.
- **c** is the speed of sound in blood (approximately 1540 m/s).
- **\Delta f** is the Doppler frequency shift.
- **f_0** is the transmitted frequency of the ultrasound.
- *cos* is the angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow.
## Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)

**Formula:**

- Pressure and flow are related by Darcy’s law: Pressure = Flow × Resistance
- MAP ≈ CO × SVR

**Factors affecting MAP:**

- Increased by vasoconstriction and increased blood viscosity.
- Decreased by vasodilation and decreased blood viscosity.
# Cardiac Cycle Phases

**Diastole (4 stages):**

1. Isovolumetric relaxation
2. Rapid ventricular filling
3. Slow ventricular filling
4. Atrial contraction

**Systole (2 stages):**

1. Isovolumetric contraction
2. Ejection

Described from late diastole (atria and ventricles are relaxed and the AV valves are open).

## 1. Slow Ventricular Filling

- **Pressure Dynamics:** Atrial pressure is higher than intraventricular pressure.
- **Valve Status:** AV valves are open.
- **Blood Flow:** Blood flows slowly from atrium to ventricle, with 90% of left ventricular filling being passive at rest.
## 2. Atrial Contraction

- **Filling Contribution:** 10% of ventricular filling at rest; 40% during exercise.
- **CVP Waveform:** A-wave represents pressure generated and transmitted along the venae cavae and pulmonary veins.
- **End-Diastolic Volume (EDV):** Volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of atrial contraction.
## 3. Isovolumetric Contraction

- **Pressure Changes:** Rapid rise in intraventricular pressure.
- **Valve Dynamics:** AV valves close when intraventricular pressure exceeds atrial pressure, producing the first heart sound (S1). The mitral valve (MV) closes before the tricuspid valve (TV), causing splitting of S1.
- **CVP Waveform:** C-wave occurs as the tricuspid valve bulges into the right atrium.
- **Key Feature:** Period between AV valve closure and semilunar valve opening, during which ventricular pressure rises without a change in volume.
## 4. Ejection

- **Valve Dynamics:** Semilunar valves open when ventricular pressure exceeds aortic and pulmonary artery pressures.
- **Blood Flow:** Initially rapid, then slows as ventricular repolarization occurs.
- **CVP Waveform:** X-descent as the right ventricle contraction pulls the tricuspid valve downward, increasing right atrium volume and reducing its pressure.
- **End-Systolic Volume (ESV):** Volume of blood in the ventricle after ejection.
- **Second Heart Sound (S2):** Semilunar valves close, producing S2, with a physiological split during inspiration.
- **Dicrotic Notch:** Positive deflection on the aortic pressure waveform caused by elastic recoil of the aortic valve and the aorta.
## 5. Isovolumetric Relaxation

- **Valve Dynamics:** Semilunar valves close, and there is a delay before ventricular pressure falls below atrial pressure.
- **CVP Waveform:** V-wave as atrial pressure rises due to venous return from the lungs and venae cavae.
## 6. Rapid Filling

- **Pressure Dynamics:** Atrial pressure exceeds ventricular pressure, leading to AV valve opening.
- **Blood Flow:** Blood flows down its pressure gradient from the atria to the ventricles.
- **CVP Waveform:** Y-descent as atrial pressure falls due to blood flowing into the ventricle.
- **Third Heart Sound (S3):** Normally absent. If present, it indicates increased atrial blood volume (e.g., mitral regurgitation) entering a poorly compliant left ventricle, causing reverberation of the ventricular wall.

# Pressure Volume Loops

## Phases of the Cardiac Cycle

1. **Isovolumetric Contraction:**
	- Represented as a vertical line indicating the increase in intraventricular pressure without a change in ventricular volume.
2. **Ventricular Ejection:**
	- Stroke volume (SV) is ejected into the aorta.
3. **Isovolumetric Relaxation:**
	- Represented as a vertical line indicating the fall in intraventricular pressure without a change in ventricular volume.
4. **Diastolic Ventricular Filling:**
	- The ventricle fills with blood, preparing for the next contraction.
![[image-145-x26-y37.png]]
### Increased Preload

- **Width of the Loop:** The width of the pressure–volume loop, representing SV, is increased due to the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV).
- **Left Ventricular End-Systolic Volume (LVESV):** Increases slightly due to an increase in afterload (aortic pressure) caused by the greater cardiac output (CO).
- **End-Diastolic Pressure-Volume Relationship (EDPVR):** Reflects the passive diastolic compliance of the left ventricle (LV). Beyond a certain preload, LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) increases sharply, reflecting the nonlinear compliance of the LV wall due to the elastic proteins and connective tissue within the myocardium reaching their elastic limit.
![[image-146-x39-y383.png]]
### Increased Afterload

- **Ejection Volume:** Reduced volume of blood is ejected from the LV, leading to an increased LVESV.
- **LVEDV:** Increases due to the addition of venous return. According to Starling’s law, an increase in LVEDV causes an increase in myocardial contractility.
- **Stroke Volume:** Initially decreases, but returns to near normal levels as myocardial contractility increases. The pressure–volume loop becomes taller and thinner.
-![[image-147-x25-y293.png]]
### Relation to Cardiac Work
#### External Work (Stroke Work)

- **Definition:** The kinetic energy expended when blood is ejected under pressure from the ventricle.
- **Representation:** The area enclosed by the ventricular pressure–volume loop (pressure times volume) represents the external work done during a single cardiac cycle.
#### Internal Work (Pressure Work)

- **Definition:** Energy expended during isovolumetric contraction.
- **Mechanism:** As contractile protein shortening does not occur, the energy expended is converted to heat energy during diastole. This energy is termed potential energy.
- **Representation:** The area enclosed within the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR), the EDPVR, and the isovolumetric relaxation lines represents the internal work.
#### Total Cardiac Work

- **Definition:** The total work done, which is the sum of external and internal work, known as the pressure–volume area (PVA).
- **Correlation:** PVA correlates well with myocardial oxygen (O2) consumption.
#### Effect of Preload on Cardiac Work

- **Increased Preload:** Leads to increased external work, thus increasing myocardial O2 demand.
#### Effect of Afterload on Cardiac Work

- **Increased Afterload:** May not significantly increase external work but does increase internal work, leading to higher myocardial O2 demand.
#### Effect of Contractility on Cardiac Work

- **Increased Myocardial Contractility:** May not increase internal work but does increase external work.
![[image-149-x28-y363.png]]
## Right Ventricular Pressure-Volume Loop

- **Lower Pressure:** The right ventricle operates at lower pressures compared to the left ventricle.
- **Afterload and Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR):** The afterload and PVR are lower for the right ventricle.
- **Stroke Volume (SV):** Despite ejecting the same volume of blood as the left ventricle, the area enclosed by the right ventricular pressure–volume loop, which represents the stroke work, is only 20–25% of that of the left ventricular loop.
- **Ejection Timing:** Blood ejection from the right ventricle begins early in systole, with right ventricular volume starting to decrease shortly after right ventricular pressure increases.
- **Stroke Work Proportion:** In the right ventricle, stroke work comprises a greater proportion of the total work compared to the left ventricle.
- **Susceptibility to Failure:** The right ventricle is more susceptible to failure in the presence of pulmonary hypertension compared to the left ventricle's response to systemic hypertension.

# Cardiac Failure

Cardiac failure occurs when the heart is unable to provide sufficient cardiac output (CO) to meet the metabolic demands of the body's tissues.

## Types of Cardiac Failure

#### High-Output Heart Failure

- **Description:** CO is normal or elevated, but tissue oxygen (O2) demand is excessively high.
- **Examples:** Thyrotoxicosis, pregnancy.
#### Low-Output Heart Failure

- **Description:** Tissue O2 demand is normal, but CO is insufficient to meet it.
## Consequences of Cardiac Failure

#### Forward Heart Failure

- **Effects:** Decreased O2 delivery to tissues.
- **Symptoms:** Renal failure (RF), fatigue, ischemic heart disease (IHD).
### Backward Heart Failure

- **Effects:** Increased left atrial pressure (LAP) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP).
- **Mechanism:** Increased hydrostatic pressure leads to fluid extravasation, resulting in pulmonary edema.
- **Progression:** Elevated right ventricular (RV) afterload leads to right heart failure.
- **Symptoms:** Peripheral edema, ascites, hepatomegaly.

## Frank-Starling Mechanism and Cardiac Failure

The Frank-Starling law describes the relationship between the length of cardiac muscle fibers (sarcomeres) and the force of contraction. In cardiac failure, sarcomeres are stretched beyond their optimal length, reducing the tension generated during contraction and impairing cardiac function.

![[image-141-x25-y406.png]]

### Laplace's Law and Cardiac Failure

In the context of cardiac failure, an enlarged heart (increased radius) leads to higher wall tension for a given pressure, further exacerbating the heart's workload and contributing to worsening cardiac function.

#### Laplace's Law

P=2T/r

where:

- **P** is the transmural pressure.
- **T** is the surface tension.
- **r** is the radius.
- Greater ventricular radius: For the same active tension generated in the ventricular wall, an LV of greater radius will produce a lower pressure than a ventricle of smaller radius. This again increases the myocardial work required to generate the same pressure
## Compensation Mechanisms in Cardiac Failure

### Sympathetic Stimulation

- **Effects:** Increases myocardial contractility and heart rate (HR), thereby maintaining cardiac output (CO) despite reduced stroke volume (SV).
- **Consequence:** Over time, the heart becomes less responsive due to downregulation of β-receptors.
### Expansion of Blood Volume

- **Mechanism:** Reduced CO leads to decreased renal blood flow (RBF).
- **RAAS Activation:** The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated, resulting in increased sodium (Na) and water (H₂O) retention and increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV).
- **Opposition:** Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) counteract this mechanism.
## Cardiac Reflexes

### Bowditch Effect (‘Staircase Effect’)

- **Mechanism:** An intrinsic autoregulatory phenomenon where tachycardia leads to increased myocardial contractility.
- **Details:** As HR increases, the diastolic interval shortens. At high HR, increased systolic calcium (Ca²⁺) influx through L-type Ca²⁺ channels and insufficient diastolic sodium (Na⁺) efflux via the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase lead to Ca²⁺ accumulation, enhancing contractility. This mechanism is similar to the effect of digoxin, which blocks the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase.
### Arterial Baroreceptor Reflex

- **Mechanism:** Changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) are detected by mechanoreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus, altering sympathetic outflow from the CNS to modify HR and systemic vascular resistance (SVR).
- **Response to Increased MAP:** Increased action potential frequency from baroreceptors leads to reduced HR.
- **Response to Decreased MAP:** Decreased action potential frequency from baroreceptors leads to increased HR.
- **Neural Pathway:** Baroreceptors transmit signals to the vasomotor center in the medulla oblongata via the glossopharyngeal (carotid sinus) and vagus nerves (aortic arch).
### Bainbridge Reflex

- **Mechanism:** Low-pressure mechanoreceptors in the great veins and right atrium respond to increased central venous pressure (CVP) by increasing HR.
- **Details:** Increased CVP distends these mechanoreceptors, which send signals via the vagus nerve to the CNS, resulting in increased sympathetic outflow to the sinoatrial (SA) node and isolated tachycardia.
- **Examples:** Observed in respiratory sinus arrhythmia and uterine autotransfusion.
### Chemoreceptor Reflex

- **Mechanism:** Peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies respond to low arterial oxygen tension (PaO₂), high carbon dioxide tension (PaCO₂), and low arterial pH, as well as severe hypotension (MAP < 60 mmHg).
- **Response:** Activation of chemoreceptors increases sympathetic nervous activity, elevating HR and MAP. Action potentials are relayed to the respiratory center in the medulla and pons, which is neurally connected to the vasomotor center.
- **Stimuli:** Pain, emotion, or temperature changes.
## Valsalva Manoeuvre

### Description

- **Awake:** Forced expiration against a closed glottis, increasing intrathoracic pressure to ~40 cmH₂O for 10 seconds.
- **Anaesthetized:** Airway pressure increased to 40 cmH₂O with the APL valve closed for 10 seconds.
### Phases

**Phase 1:**

- **Effect:** Increased intrathoracic pressure compresses pulmonary vessels, transiently increasing SV and MAP, and decreasing HR via the baroreceptor reflex.

**Phase 2:**

- **Effect:** Sustained high intrathoracic pressure reduces venous return, decreasing SV and MAP, triggering reflex tachycardia to normalize MAP.

**Phase 3:**

- **Effect:** Release of airway pressure fills intrathoracic vessels, decreasing SV and MAP further, with a reflex increase in HR.

**Phase 4:**

- **Effect:** Restored LV preload increases MAP, with an overshoot corrected by reflex bradycardia. Both MAP and HR then return to normal.
### Uses

- **Termination of Supraventricular Tachycardia:** Phase 4 vagal stimulation slows AV node conduction.
- **Diagnosis of Murmurs:** Increases intensity of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy murmur while decreasing most other murmurs, including aortic stenosis.
- **Test of Autonomic Function:** Lack of reflex responses in Phase 2 and Phase 4 indicates autonomic dysfunction.
- **Diagnosis of High Venous Pressure:** A square-wave response indicates conditions like congestive heart failure and constrictive pericarditis, showing elevated MAP without reflex changes.

# Cardiac Physical Examination

## Pulsus Paradoxus

[Pulses paradoxis](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Pulsus-Paradoxus/)

### Pulsus Paradoxus

		- No room in the pericardial sac for the left ventricle to expand and maintain normal end diastolic volume (i.e., ↓↓ Left ventricle filling)
	- **Result:**
		- ↓↓ Left heart stroke volume/cardiac output
3. **With Vascular Pathology (Rare)**
	- **Mechanism:**
		- **Vena Cava Obstruction:**
			- Obstruction by neoplasm or external compression by masses/fibrosis (e.g., obesity, pregnancy)
			- ↓↓ Venous return to right heart
		- **Pulmonary Embolism:**
			- Thrombi in the pulmonary arteries ↓ Blood filling
			- On inspiration, as pulmonary intra-vascular volume expands and blood pools within, flow into the left heart ↓↓↓
	- **Result:**
		- ↓↓↓ Left heart stroke volume/cardiac output

### Kussmaul's Sign Explained

#### Mechanism of Kussmaul's Sign

1. **Inspiration:**
	
	- ↓ Pressure in thoracic cavity
	- More venous blood tries to enter the low-pressure thoracic cavity via the right ventricle
2. **Pathologies:**
- **Restrictive Cardiomyopathy:**
	- Myocardium of the right ventricle becomes fibrotic and stiffer
	- ↓ Right ventricle wall compliance
	- ↓ Ability of the right ventricle to accommodate higher venous return
- **Right Ventricle Myocardial Infarct:**
	- Myocardium of the right ventricle becomes fibrotic and stiffer
	- ↓ Right ventricle wall compliance
	- ↓ Ability of the right ventricle to accommodate higher venous return
- **Constrictive Pericarditis:**
	- Inflamed, fibrotic pericardium restricts expansion of the heart
	- Right ventricle prevented from fully expanding
	- ↓ Ability of the right ventricle to accommodate higher venous return
- **Cardiac Tamponade (Rare):**
	- Excessive pericardial fluid compresses heart walls on all sides
	- Right ventricle prevented from fully expanding
	- ↓ Ability of the right ventricle to accommodate higher venous return
3. **Result:**
	- Backup of venous blood into the right atrium and preceding internal jugular veins
	- **Kussmaul's sign:**
		- JVP increases with inspiration
### Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP): Physical Exam Features

#### The Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP)

- **Definition:**
	- Blood pressure in the internal jugular veins
#### Exam Features
1. **Normal Physiology:**
	- Venous blood pressure is normally very low
	- Jugular venous pulse (JVP) is visible and corresponds to the stages of the cardiac cycle
2. **Palpation:**
	- Non-palpable jugular veins
3. **Compression Test:**
	- Occludable internal jugular veins
4. **Waveform:**
	- A-wave: Pressure in the right atrium is transmitted into internal jugular veins
	- V-wave: Blood passively fills the right atrium during ventricular systole
	- Biphasic waveform
5. **Pressure Points:**
	- Pressing hard on the abdomen (overlying the liver)
	- Blood is forced up into the right atrium → venous blood backup into internal jugular veins
	- ↑ JVP
6. **Positional Changes:**
	- Tilting the head of the bed:
		- Up: Blood in internal jugular veins settles to the bottom of the internal jugular vein (analogy: half-full tube of water is turned vertically) → ↑ JVP
		- Down: Blood in internal jugular veins settles along the side of the internal jugular vein (analogy: half-full tube of water is turned horizontally) → ↓ JVP
7. **Breathing:**
	- Intrathoracic pressure changes with respiration:
		- **Inspiration:**
			- ↓ Intrathoracic pressure
			- Blood enters the internal jugular veins more readily
			- Filling pressure of the right atrium and internal jugular veins ↓
			- ↓ JVP
		- **Expiration:**
			- ↑ Intrathoracic pressure
			- Blood is pumped into the pulmonary circulation
			- Filling pressure of the right atrium and internal jugular veins ↑
			- ↑ JVP
8. **Body Position:**
	- Pulmonary circulation accepts more venous blood (↑ Preload), ↑ stroke volume of next heart-beat, shifting more blood into arteries
	- JVP changes with body position
9. **Observation:**
	- Since the internal jugular veins are continuous with the right atrium, the JVP is a reliable estimate of right atrial blood pressure (Central Venous Pressure). The JVP on the right side is a better "barometer" than the JVP on the left, because the right internal jugular communicates more directly with the right atrium.
	- JVP should return to normal within 3 respiration cycles
## Orthostatic Hypotension

[Orthostatic hypotension](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Orthostatic-Hypotension-Pathogenesis-and-clinical-findings/)

### Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

#### Pathophysiology
1. **Normal Physiology:**
	
	- Venous return → Stroke volume → Arterial blood pressure
	- Appropriate baroreceptor reflex response
	- Stretch of arterial baroreceptors → Baroreceptor firing → Output from nucleus tractus solitarius in the medulla:
		- ↓ Vagus nerve activity
		- ↓ Parasympathetic activity
		- ↑ Sympathetic activity
		- ↑ Heart rate and contractility
		- ↑ Peripheral vasoconstriction
	- **Result:**
		- Minimal change in arterial blood pressure
2. **Abnormal Physiology:**
	- Cardiac output is diminished, or the effective arterial blood volume is decreased:
		- ↓ Venous return
		- Appropriate, but inadequate baroreceptor reflex response:
			- Impaired baroreceptor reflex response
			- Impaired ability to ↑ Sympathetic activity
	- **Result:**
		- Minimal heart rate change
		- ↓ SAP and/or ↓ DAP
		- Orthostatic hypotension: Sustained reduction in SAP of at least 20 mmHg or DAP of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing
#### Mechanism of Orthostatic Hypotension

1. **Non-neurogenic:**
	- Hypovolemia, cardiac pump impairments (e.g., aortic stenosis), medications (e.g., diuretics, vasodilators, direct vasodilators, and tricyclic anti-depressants)
2. **Neurogenic:**

	- Spinal cord injury, autonomic neuropathies, pure autonomic failure, Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy
#### Symptoms

- Dizziness, visual blurring, cerebral hypoperfusion resulting from ↓ Arterial blood pressure
