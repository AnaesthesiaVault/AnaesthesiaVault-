## Monomorphic VT

[Monomorphic VT_Calgary Guide](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Sustained-Monomorphic-Ventricular-Tachycardia-Clinical-findings/)

**Definition:**
- A wide QRS complex tachycardia originating from the ventricles lasting > 30 seconds. Mechanisms include re-entry (e.g., scar-mediated) or increased automaticity.

**Pathophysiology:**
- The sinoatrial node continues to depolarize the atria while the ventricles depolarize independently.
- Re-entrant circuits or ectopic focus uniformly depolarize ventricular myocytes.

**Mechanism and Symptoms:**
- **Heart Rate > 100 beats/minute:** Decreased ventricular filling time, preload, and stroke volume, leading to palpitations and hypotension.
- **Right Atrium:** Contracts against a closed tricuspid valve causing Cannon A waves.

**ECG Findings:**
- AV dissociation
- Uniform morphology of QRS complexes
- Wide QRS complexes (≥ 120 milliseconds)

**Complications:**
- Inadequate organ perfusion, general malaise, chest pain, syncope, shortness of breath, hemodynamic collapse, and potentially sudden cardiac arrest or death.

**Illustrated Flow:**
- Loss of coordination between atria and ventricles → AV dissociation → Capture beat/Fusion beat.
- Symptoms: Palpitations, hypotension, Cannon A waves.
- Organs affected: Muscles, heart, brain.

**Outcome:**
- Inability to respond to increased cardiac demand, leading to severe complications, including death.

# WPW

[WPW_Calgary Guide](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Wolff-Parkinson-White---Pathogenesis-and-clinical-findings/)

**Pathophysiology:**
- **Congenital Accessory Pathway:** An alternative electrical conduction pathway from the atria to the ventricles.
- **Wolff-Parkinson-White Pattern:** ECG findings showing isolated ventricular pre-excitation.
- **Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome:** ECG findings associated with supraventricular arrhythmias.

**Mechanism:**
- Impulse travels faster along the accessory pathway, shortening the time between atrial and ventricular depolarization (Short PR interval <0.12 sec).
- Early ventricular depolarization (preexcitation) leads to wide QRS complex with a delta wave.
- Altered ventricular repolarization results in ST and T-wave changes.

**Arrhythmias:**
- **Orthodromic AVRT:** Narrow QRS complex tachycardia.
- **Antidromic AVRT:** Wide QRS complex tachycardia.
- **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** Wide, irregular QRS complex tachycardia.

**Clinical Notes:**
- WPW pattern is more common than WPW syndrome.
- Patients may also experience atrial flutter, AVNRT, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.

## Management of Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome

### Acute Management
- **Unstable:** Synchronized DC shock.
- **Stable:** Anti-arrhythmic to prolong the accessory pathway refractory period:
  - Sotalol
  - Amiodarone
  - Flecainide
  - Procainamide
- **Contraindicated Drugs:**
  - Digoxin (shortens refractory period)
  - Verapamil and lignocaine (increase ventricular rate)
  - Beta-blockers (no effect on accessory pathway refractory period)
### Long-term Management
- Radio-frequency ablation

# Atrial Flutter

[Atrial Flutter_Calgory Guide](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Atrial-Flutter/)

### Atrial Flutter: Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings
**Pathophysiology:**
- **Causes:** Rheumatic heart disease, idiopathic, LV dysfunction, iatrogenic (cardiac surgery).
- **Mechanism:**
  - Spontaneous premature depolarization of atrial tissue.
  - Depolarization wave propagates around atrial free-wall myocardium.
  - The "re-entry loop" electrical impulse circulates at a rate of 180-350/min, usually in the right atrium.
**Electrical Conduction:**
- Tissue of the tricuspid valve annulus conducts the wave.
- Conduction of depolarization wave through atrial septum.
- AV node conducts only if not in a refractory state.
**ECG Findings:**
- Saw-tooth P waves (waves inverted in leads II, III, and aVF).
- Short PR interval (<0.12 sec).
- 1 QRS complex per 2-5 atrial P waves.
**Clinical Manifestations:**
- **Heart Rate:** Pulse of 60-200 bpm.
- **Symptoms:** Dyspnea, presyncope, fatigue.
- Carotid massage or vagal maneuvers decrease AV node conductivity, leading to transient decreases in ventricular rate.
- If high ventricular rate decreases diastolic filling time, cardiac output decreases, leading to ineffective perfusion of body tissues.
**Other Notes:**
- WPW pattern is more common than WPW syndrome, both rare (<1%).
- Other arrhythmias can occur with WPW: atrial flutter, AVNRT, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.
- ST and T wave changes present in the opposite direction to the QRS complex and delta wave.

# Torsade's Des Points

[Torsades_Calgary](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Torsades-de-Pointes-(TdP)--Pathogenesis-and-Clinical-Findings/)

## Pathophysiology
- **Causes:**
	- **Acquired Long QT Syndrome:** Drugs (Class 1A, Class III, TCAs, erythromycin), sinus bradycardia, AV block, metabolic abnormalities (hypo K+/Ca2+/Mg2+), primary heart disease (ischemic, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy).
	- **Congenital Long QT Syndrome:** Mutated cardiac ion channels, leading to decreased repolarizing current/increased depolarizing current in cardiomyocytes.
- **Mechanism:** Prolonged ventricular action potential duration → Early after depolarization (EAD) → Triggering PVC → Functional re-entry.
## ECG Findings
- **QTc Interval:** Prolonged.
- **ECG Changes:** Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with shifting QRS morphology.
## Clinical Manifestations
- **Non-sustained TdP:** Asymptomatic, palpitations, syncope.
- **Sustained TdP:** Degeneration to ventricular fibrillation (VF), sudden cardiac death.
## Management
**Unstable:**
	Defibrillation (200J biphasic)- may not be able to lock onto a QRS complex so may need to be unsynchronised.
**Stable:**
	IV magnesium 2g over 15 mins, followed by 1g per hour.
	Treat any hypokalaemia.
	Stop all medications that prolong QT.
**If refractory:**
	Speed up the heart:
	Chemicallyadrenaline infusion, dobutamine or isoproterenol.
	Electricallytranscutaneous pacing.
	Lignocaine 1-1.5mg/kg
# Ventricular Fibrillation

[VF_Calgaory_guide](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/ventricular-fibrillation-pathogenesis-and-clinical-findings/)

## Pathophysiology
- **Channelopathies:** Alterations in ion transport (e.g., Long QT or Brugada Syndromes).
- **Accessory Pathway:** Alternatives for impulse conduction.
- **Structural Abnormalities:** Congenital or acquired heart defects (e.g., cardiomyopathy, MI, cardiac surgery, ARVD).
## Trigger Events
- Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
- Dysrhythmias
- Electrolyte abnormalities (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+)
- Hypoperfusion
- Hypothermia
- Hypoglycemia
- Trauma
- Drugs
## Mechanism
- An acute trigger event can precipitate ectopic electrical activity and multiple micro-re-entry circuits.
- Disorganized electrical activity interferes with normal conduction, causing uncoordinated ventricular contraction.
### Clinical Findings
- **ECG:** Disorganized without identifiable QRS or T waves.
- **Symptoms:** Loss of consciousness, no palpable pulse, no heart rate (HR), no blood pressure (BP).
- **Complications:** Clinical cardiac arrest, global hypoperfusion, multi-system organ failure, hypoxic brain, brain damage, brain death, death.
**Note:** Ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency requiring CPR and defibrillation.
