# Acute Coronary Syndrome

- Major non-cardiac surgery is associated with an incidence of perioperative cardiac death of 0.5–1.5% and major cardiovascular complications (e.g., myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke) of 2–3.5%.

## Definitions

- **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS):** A spectrum of conditions characterized by varying myocardial ischemic states.
	
	- ACS is broadly categorized based on evidence of myocardial ischemia on an electrocardiogram (ECG) and myocardial necrosis from serum levels of cardiac biochemical markers (e.g., troponin):
		- **ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)**
		- **Non-ST-Elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS):**
			- Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) (associated troponin rise)
			- Unstable Angina (no myocardial cell necrosis/troponin increase)
- In general, STEMI is associated with more prolonged duration of ischemia and a larger territory of myocardial necrosis (e.g., after a complete coronary artery occlusion) than NSTEMI.
- The short-term mortality from STEMI is marginally higher than that from NSTEMI, but the 4-year mortality rate for patients with NSTEMI is twice that of STEMI patients.
	
### STEMI

- ST-segment elevation >1 mm in two consecutive limb leads, 2 mm in two consecutive chest leads, or new onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) is indicative of STEMI and should be promptly managed.
- NSTE-ACS usually presents as ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion. The ECG may be normal, especially if the pain has resolved.

## Risk Factors

- **Non-Modifiable:**
	
	- Advancing age
	- Male gender
	- Family history of premature coronary artery disease (males <55 years and females <65 years)
	- Premature menopause
	- Ethnicity (e.g., higher risk in individuals from the Indian subcontinent)
- **Modifiable:**
	
	- Smoking
	- Diabetes mellitus
	- Hypertension
	- Obesity
	- Sedentary lifestyle
	- High cholesterol, specifically a high ratio of low-density to high-density lipoprotein
## Management of ACS

### STEMI
#### Initial Steps
1. **Offer aspirin** (unless already given).
2. **Assess eligibility for reperfusion therapy**:
   - **Eligible**: Proceed to next steps.
   - **Not eligible**: Offer medical therapy.
#### Eligibility Assessment
- **Presentation within 12 hours of symptom onset?**
  - **Yes**: Proceed to PPCI assessment.
  - **No**: Check for continuing ischaemia.
	- **Continuing ischaemia?**
	  - **Yes**: Consider angiography/PCI.
	  - **No**: Offer medical therapy.
#### Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PPCI)
- **PPCI anticipated within 120 min of potential fibrinolysis?**
  - **Yes**: Activate PPCI pathway.
	- **PPCI Pathway**:
	  - Transfer to PPCI centre immediately.
	  - Do not offer routine glycoprotein inhibitors/fibrinolysis.
	  - Offer additional antiplatelet agents (choose one):
		- Clopidogrel
		- Prasugrel
		- Ticagrelor
	  - Take to catheter laboratory for angiography and coronary angiography.
		- Offer bivalirudin or heparin (UFH or LMWH).
		- Consider radial over femoral access.
		- Consider thrombus aspiration.
  - **No**: Offer fibrinolysis with antithrombin.
#### Fibrinolysis
- Offer in compliance with NICE.
- **Post-fibrinolysis Electrocardiogram (60–90 min after)**
  - **Residual ST-segment elevation (failed reperfusion)**:
	- Offer immediate angiography (with follow-on PCI if indicated). Do not repeat fibrinolysis.
  - **No residual ST-segment elevation (successful reperfusion)**:
	- **Clinically stable**: Consider angiography during the same hospital admission.
	- **Recurrent myocardial ischaemia**: Seek specialist cardiological advice and consider coronary angiography with follow-on PCI if indicated.
#### Secondary Prevention and Support
- Offer written and oral information, advice, support, and treatment on related conditions and secondary prevention (including lifestyle advice) as per NICE guidelines.

### NSTEMI and UA

### NICE Guidelines 2010: Early Management for Unstable Angina and NSTEMI

#### Initial Treatment Steps
1. **Aspirin**:
   - Offer a single loading dose of 300 mg and continue indefinitely.
2. **Antithrombin Therapy**:
   - Fondaparinux if no high bleeding risk and angiography planned within 24 h.
   - Unfractionated heparin if angiography likely within 24 h or if creatinine > 265 µmol/L.
   - Adjust dose to clotting function.
3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Use scoring systems such as GRACE to predict 6-month mortality.
   - Assess future adverse cardiovascular events, bleeding risk, and comorbidities.
#### Factors for Assessing
- Full clinical history
- Physical examination
- Twelve-lead resting ECG
- Blood tests (troponin I or T, creatinine, glucose, hemoglobin)
#### Factors Associated with High Bleeding Risk
- Increasing age
- Known bleeding complications
- Renal impairment
- Low body weight
#### Risk Categories and Management
**1. Lowest Risk (<1.5%)**
- **Management**:
  - Initial conservative management.
  - If recurrent spontaneous ischaemia, proceed to coronary angiography.

**2. Low Risk (1.5–3.0%)**
- **Management**:
  - Single 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel and continue for 12 months.

**3. Intermediate Risk (3.0–6.0%)**
- **Management**:
  - Single 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel and continue for 12 months.
  - Consider additional antiplatelet (GPI or bivalirudin) based on ischemic vs bleeding risk.
  - Offer coronary angiography with follow-on PCI if indicated.

**4. High Risk (6.0–9.0%)**
- **Management**:
  - Same as intermediate risk but prioritize angiography if unstable.

**5. Highest Risk (>9.0%)**
- **Management**:
  - Single 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel and continue for 12 months.
  - Consider additional antiplatelet (GPI or bivalirudin) based on ischemic vs bleeding risk.
  - Offer coronary angiography with follow-on PCI if indicated.
#### Post-Angiography
- **PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention)**:
  - Consider abciximab if not on GPI.
  - Offer unfractionated heparin to patients on fondaparinux.
  - Consider bivalirudin as an alternative.
- **CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting)**:
  - Stop clopidogrel 5 days before CABG.
  - Offer surgery to patients with adverse cardiovascular events.
#### Additional Considerations
- Discuss management strategy with an interventional cardiologist and cardiac surgeon.
- Consider comorbidities, risks, and benefits when discussing revascularization strategies.

# Perioperative Myocardial Infarction (MINS)

## Overview
- **Timing and Symptoms**: Most PMIs occur early after surgery and are often asymptomatic.
- **ECG Findings**: Commonly preceded by ST-segment depression. ST-elevation is rare (<2% of cases).
- **Histological Findings**: Both circumferential infarction (due to myocardial oxygen supply mismatch) and transmural infarctions are commonly found.
### Mechanisms
1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) due to a Primary Coronary Event**:
	- **Pathophysiology**:
		- Occurs when coronary plaques rupture or fissure, leading to coronary thrombosis.
		- Postoperative increases in catecholamines and cortisol, especially with anaemia, hypothermia, or pain.
		- Tachycardia and hypertension post-surgery cause shear stresses, leading to plaque rupture.
		- Pro-coagulant and pro-thrombotic state with elevated fibrinogen, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, increased platelet activation, and decreased protein C and antithrombin levels.
	- **Classification**:
		- According to the universal classification of myocardial infarction, this is defined as a **type 1 myocardial infarction**.
2. **Reduced Myocardial Oxygen Supply to Demand Ratio**:
	- **Pathophysiology**:
		- Associated with intraoperative and postoperative hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, anaemia, hypoxaemia, hypercarbia, and hypothermia.
		- Represents a spectrum from minor myocardial ischaemia with low-level troponin increase to prolonged overt ischaemia in multiple ECG leads, resulting in significant myocardial necrosis and high troponin elevation.
	- **Classification**:
		- Defined as a **type 2 myocardial infarction**.
#### Key Points
- PMIs typically occur early post-surgery and are often asymptomatic.
- ECG findings are usually ST-segment depression, with ST-elevation being rare.
- Mechanisms include ACS due to plaque rupture (type 1 MI) and reduced myocardial oxygen supply to demand ratio (type 2 MI).
# Management of Antiplatelet Therapy

		- Endoscopy
		- Eye anterior chamber
		- Dental extraction and surgery
- **Intermediate Risk**
	- **Blood Transfusion Requirement**: Frequently required
	- **Type of Surgery**:
		- Visceral surgery
		- Cardiovascular surgery
		- Major orthopaedic surgery
		- Otolaryngology
		- Urological surgery

	- <2 weeks PTCA
	- <6 weeks MI
	- <6 weeks BMS
	- <6 months DES
	- <12 months DES with increased risk of ST
	- **Emergency Surgery**
		- Continue with treatment
	- **Urgent Surgery**
		- High risk for bleeding
			- Stop ADP inhibitors and ASA
			- Bridging therapy
		- Intermediate Risk of Bleeding
			- Stop ADP inhibitors, continue ASA
		- Low risk of bleeding
			- Continue with treatment
	- **Elective Surgery**
		- Delay surgery
- **Low-Risk Situations**
	- Stop ADP inhibitors, continue ASA

# Biomarkers

## Significant Studies

### VISION Study
- **Key Finding**: High sensitivity troponin level post non-cardiac surgery is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality.
- **Diagnostic Threshold**: Peak levels of 0.03 ng/ml are judged to be diagnostic of myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS).

- **Key Finding**: Post-operative NT-proBNP levels in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery are the strongest independent predictor of outcomes at 30 days and ≥180 days post-operation.
### Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines
- **Application**: Use NT-proBNP levels for risk stratification in pre-operative cardiac assessment for non-cardiac surgery.

## ProBNP

### Introduction

- The most commonly used clinical risk stratification tool, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), is recommended by both the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESC/ESA) guidelines for pre-operative cardiac risk assessment. However, the RCRI misclassifies a substantial number of patients in mixed cohorts of non-cardiac surgical patients.
- The association between pre-operative natriuretic peptides (NPs) and major postoperative cardiovascular complications has been extensively validated in prospective studies.

## Trop T

### Introduction

- Pre-operative troponin elevation may be useful to risk stratify vascular surgery patients pre-operatively, demonstrating prospective validation.
- A prospective observational study of patients with a history of coronary artery disease or at risk of coronary artery disease undergoing major non-cardiac surgery has shown that a pre-operative high-sensitivity troponin T above the upper reference limit (> 14 ng/ml) is independently associated with early postoperative and 3-year mortality.
- In all non-cardiac surgical patients with known cardiovascular risk or undergoing major surgery, we recommend postoperative troponin monitoring.

### Postoperative Troponin Monitoring

- An analysis of the first 15,133 patients in the study found that patients with a peak postoperative troponin T elevation ≤ 0.01 ng/ml had a mortality rate of 1%. In contrast, patients with a peak troponin T value of 0.02, 0.03-0.29, and ≥ 0.3 ng/ml had mortality rates of 4%, 9.3%, and 16.9%, respectively.
- In summary, postoperative troponin elevation, with and without myocardial infarction defining features, is associated with a significant increase in mortality risk.

#### Interpretation of Postoperative Troponin Thresholds for Predicting 30-day Mortality After Non-Cardiac Surgery

- **< 0.01 µg/l:** Low 30-day mortality (1%) with a low likelihood ratio (0.53).
	
- **0.02 µg/l:** Moderate 30-day mortality (4%) with an increased likelihood ratio (2.22).
	
- **0.03-0.29 µg/l:** High 30-day mortality (9.3%) with a significantly higher likelihood ratio (5.39).
	
- **≥ 0.30 µg/l:** Very high 30-day mortality (16.9%) with the highest likelihood ratio (10.71).
	
- The cardiac troponins (cTn) T and I are the most commonly used biomarkers of myocardial damage. They become elevated around 3–6 hours, peak at around 12–24 hours, and can remain elevated for up to 2 weeks, depending on renal function.
	
- Abnormal levels of cTn are defined as those above the 99th percentile of the normal population or upper reference limit for that laboratory assay, and most local cardiology services will issue a ‘positive’ result range.
	
- Elevated levels of cTn must be interpreted in the clinical context. Serial cTn levels may aid diagnosis (e.g., a rapid increase within 24 hours, peak levels >50× upper reference limit, and rapid decrease of >50% within 72 hours are indicative of acute myocardial infarction).
	
- In ACS, higher troponin levels (peak values and area under the cTn–time curve) correlate with infarct size and consequent risk of mortality and morbidity. In the postoperative population, an elevated troponin, peaking in the first 3 days after operation, is strongly associated with increased 30-day mortality.
### Causes for Raise Trop T Levels
#### Demand Ischemia (In the Absence of ACS)
- Supraventricular tachycardia/atrial fibrillation
- Left ventricular hypertrophy
- Anemia
- Hypotension
- Hypovolemia

- Cardiac infiltrative disorders
- Chemotherapy
- Myocarditis
- Cardiac transplantation(immune-mediated reactions)
#### Myocardial Strain
