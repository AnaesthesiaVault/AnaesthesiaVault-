# Lung Resection
## Morbidity and Mortality

- In 2015, **pneumonectomy** accounted for 5% of surgeries for lung cancer in England. The survival rates post-pneumonectomy are:
    
    - **30-day**: 92.3%
    - **90-day**: 88.4%
    - **1-year**: 74.6%
    
    These rates are significantly lower compared to combined bilobectomy, lobectomy, and sleeve resection procedures, which show survival rates of:
    
    - **30-day**: 98.5%
    - **90-day**: 96.8%
    - **1-year**: 89%
- **Postoperative mortality** increases with age, possibly due to the right ventricle's inability to adapt to the increased **pulmonary vascular resistance** (PVR) following resection. The right-sided pneumonectomy presents a higher mortality risk than left-sided due to:
    
    - Higher pulmonary vascular resistance in the smaller left lung
    - Increased incidence of **right ventricular failure**
    - Higher rates of **bronchopleural fistula (BPF)**
- **Quality of life** after pneumonectomy is poorer than after lobectomy or bilobectomy.
    
Given these concerns, thoracic surgeons reserve pneumonectomy as a **last resort**, after excluding other surgical options such as sleeve lobectomy or non-anatomical resections. When pneumonectomy is considered, careful evaluation of the patient's **physiological reserve** and predicted postoperative (ppo) respiratory function is crucial. Patients should also be fully informed of alternative approaches, including those that may carry a higher risk of **cancer recurrence**
#### Indications

The primary indication for pneumonectomy is **bronchial carcinoma**, particularly when:

- The tumor is located at the **main stem bronchus**, proximal to the **bronchus intermedius**, or involves the **hilar structures**.

Other indications for pneumonectomy include:

- **Traumatic lung injury** with uncontrolled hemorrhage
- **Chronic infectious diseases** like tuberculosis
- **Fungal infections** causing significant lung destruction

## Types of Pneumonectomy

1. **Standard Pneumonectomy**
    
    - Most common approach involving the removal of the affected lung.
    - Ensures a **safe bronchial margin** for closure of the bronchial stump.
    - Pulmonary artery and veins are ligated **without intrapericardial access**.
2. **Intrapericardial Pneumonectomy**
    
    - Required when:
        - The **right or left main pulmonary artery** is involved.
        - Tumor proximity to the pulmonary veins necessitates isolation and division at the **left atrium** to ensure clear vascular margins.
    - Close coordination between the surgeon and anesthetist is essential during **pulmonary artery clamping** to maintain stable **cardiac output**.
3. **Extrapleural Pneumonectomy**
    
    - A more radical procedure, typically reserved for **mesothelioma**.
    - Involves excision of:
        - Affected lung
        - **Ipsilateral pleura**
        - **Hemidiaphragm**
        - **Hemipericardium**
    - Reconstruction with patches may be required.
    - Rarely performed after the **Mesothelioma and Radical Surgery trial** showed worse outcomes compared to medical management.
4. **Completion Pneumonectomy**
    
    - Refers to excision of remaining lung tissue after prior resection surgery.
5. **Carinal Pneumonectomy**
    
    - Rarely performed, involving the excision of the lung and **carina**.
    - Typically done for patients with tumors at the **distal trachea** or **carina**.

## Goals
- **Determine suitability for resection with the “3-legged stool” approach**:
  - Respiratory mechanics
  - Gas exchange
  - Cardio-respiratory interaction
- **Preoperative optimization**:
  - Smoking cessation
  - Pulmonary rehabilitation
  - Treatment of lung infections and bronchospasm
- **Pristine intraoperative management**:
  - Thoracic epidural analgesia
  - Fluid restriction
  - Lung-protective ventilation
  - Avoidance of hypothermia

## Preoperative Assessment for Pneumonectomy

### Lung Cancer Staging

Lung cancers are categorized into:

- **Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)** (85% of cases), further divided into:
    - **Adenocarcinoma**
    - **Squamous cell carcinoma**
    - **Large-cell carcinoma**
- **Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)**

Staging of lung cancer follows the **eighth edition of the tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classification**. All patients should undergo:

1. **CT scan**
2. **Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT)** to evaluate lymph node status.

- If **PET-CT positive mediastinal lymph nodes** are found, further sampling via **endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)** or **mediastinoscopy** is required.
- Surgery is typically offered to patients with **T1-3 N0-1 M0** disease. In select cases, patients with **T4 or N2** disease may also undergo radical multimodal treatment after discussion within the multidisciplinary team (MDT).

### Suitability for Surgery

According to the **British Thoracic Society (BTS)**, preoperative risk assessment for lung resection is divided into three domains:

1. **Operative mortality**
2. **Perioperative myocardial events**
3. **Postoperative dyspnoea**
#### Operative Mortality
- **Thoracoscore** can estimate postoperative mortality based on nine factors: age, sex, ASA score, performance status, dyspnoea score, surgical priority, extent of surgery, malignancy, and co-morbidity.
- Thoracoscore has limitations, and therefore, more emphasis is placed on evaluating **exercise capacity** and **physiological reserve**.
#### Perioperative Myocardial Events
- Patients with **active cardiac conditions** (e.g., unstable angina, heart failure, arrhythmias) should consult a cardiologist for medical optimization.
- In patients without active cardiac conditions, use the **Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)**. If RCRI ≥ 3 or poor functional capacity is noted, refer for **exercise stress testing** and cardiology review.
- **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is recommended for all patients undergoing pneumonectomy, especially for those with **unexplained dyspnoea** or **audible heart murmur**. **Pulmonary hypertension** is a relative contraindication, particularly for **right pneumonectomy** due to the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.
##### Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)
- **Number of Factors and Risk of Major Cardiac Complication**:
  - 0: 0.4%
  - 1: 1%
  - 2: 7%
  - ≥3: 11%
- **Risk Factors**:
  - High-risk type of surgery (includes all thoracic surgery)
  - Ischaemic heart disease
  - History of congestive cardiac failure
  - History of cerebrovascular disease
  - Insulin therapy for diabetes
  - Preoperative serum creatinine > 177 μmol/L

Cardiac complications include myocardial infarction, pulmonary oedema, ventricular fibrillation, primary cardiac arrest, and complete heart block.
##### Thoracic Revised Cardiac Risk Index (ThRCRI)
- **ThRCRI and Major Cardiac Complications (%)**:
  - 0: 1.5%
  - 1–1.5: 5.8%
  - 2–2.5: 19%
  - more than 2.5: 23%
- **Criteria**:
  - Serum creatinine > 180 μmol/L (1 point)
  - Cerebrovascular disease (1.5 points)
  - Cardiac ischemia (1.5 points)
  - Pneumonectomy (1.5 points)

**Surgical Options**:
- Lobectomy or pneumonectomy usually not recommended if <35% or <10 ml/kg/min
- Consider other options if risk is high

#### Postoperative Dyspnoea
Preoperative lung function testing assesses **respiratory mechanics** and **lung parenchymal function**:
- **Respiratory Mechanics (ppo FEV1)**: Predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppo FEV1) can be calculated using the formula:
	- ppo FEV1 = preop FEV1 × (19 - number of segments to be resected) / 19
- Scintigraphy can be used in borderline cases to estimate lung function based on perfusion data
	- % ppo FEV1 = preop FEV1 × (100 - % perfusion to lung to be resected) / predicted FEV1
- **Lung Parenchymal Function (DLCO)**: Measures gas transfer effectiveness at the alveolar-capillary unit. A **ppo DLCO** < 30% predicts increased risk of postoperative complications and should prompt further testing such as **cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)**.
##### Segment Methods for Predicting Postoperative Pulmonary Function

**Ppo is predicted by**:
- Calculating the portion of all bronchopulmonary segments (BPS) that will remain after resection.
- Multiplying this portion by the preoperative lung function value.

**Segments**:
- Total pulmonary segments: 19
  - Right lung: 10 segments (3/2/5): 55%
  - Left lung: 9 segments (3 upper, 2 lingula, 4 lower): 45%

**Calculate Predicted Postoperative FEV1 (ppoFEV1):**
- ppoFEV1=Preoperative FEV1×(Number of Remaining Lung Segments/Total Number of Lung Segments)
- ppoFEV1%= (ppoFEV1/Predicted Normal FEV1​)×100
- *FEV1 in litres*
###### Example
- **Preoperative values**:
	- Preoperative FEV1: 2.5 liters
	- Predicted normal FEV1 for the patient (based on age, sex, height): 3.0 L
	- Surgery involves resection of the right lower lobe (which contains 5 segments).
	- After resection, the remaining lung segments are 14 out of 19.
- **Calculate ppoFEV1**:
	- ppoFEV1 = 2.5 liters × (14 / 19) = 1.84 liters
- **Calculate ppoFEV1 as a percentage**:
	- ppoFEV1% = (1.84 liters / 3.0 liters) × 100 = 61.3%

**Risk Categories**:
- Low risk: ≥40% ppoFEV1
- Moderate risk: 30% to 40% ppoFEV1
- High risk: <30% ppoFEV1
##### Functional Assessment of Cardiopulmonary Interaction
- **Shuttle Walk Test**: Patients walk between two 10 m spaced cones at an increasing pace. A distance >400 m correlates with a **peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak)** > 15 mL O₂/kg/min. Patients covering <400 m should be referred for **CPET**.
- **Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET)**: The most critical measure is **V_O2 peak**:
    - **VO2 peak >20 mL O₂/kg/min**: Suitable for pneumonectomy.
    - **VO2 peak <10 mL O₂/kg/min**: Contraindication for surgery.

#### Determine Physiological Suitability for Procedure by Assessing Predicted Postpneumonectomy Pulmonary Function
- ppoFEV1 > 40%
- ppoDLCO > 40%
- VO2 max > 15 mL/kg/min (> 4 METS)
- Consider V/Q scanning for all pneumonectomies &/or if ppoFEV1 < 40%

## Conduct of Anaesthesia for Lung Resection

### Surgical Approach

1. **Preoperative Rigid Bronchoscopy**:
    
    - Performed after induction of anesthesia to confirm sufficient bronchus length free of tumor, ensuring the feasibility of the procedure.
    - **Sleeve lobectomy** is considered if a portion of the bronchus or pulmonary artery is involved, eliminating the need for pneumonectomy by excising the affected lobe and bronchus/artery with anastomosis of the remaining structures.
2. **Common Surgical Approach**:
    
    - The most common access is a **posterolateral thoracotomy** at the fifth intercostal space, sometimes requiring excision of the fifth rib for exposure.
    - Alternatively, **video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)** can be used.
    - The chest is explored for **pleural effusions** and **metastatic deposits** on the pleura or diaphragm before continuing.
    - Once confirmed, the lung is retracted, and the superior and inferior pulmonary veins and pulmonary artery are sequentially ligated and divided.
    - The **bronchus** is stapled and cut, with the patency tested by filling the thorax with warm saline and performing a leak test.
    - A **thoracostomy tube** is placed in the postpneumonectomy space.

### Anaesthesia
1. **Induction**:
    
    - Confirm availability of a **level 2 postoperative care bed** and crossmatch two units of blood.
    - Postoperative analgesia options include **midthoracic epidural** or **paravertebral catheter**.
    - **Invasive arterial pressure monitoring** and **central venous catheterisation** are recommended for fluid and vasopressor management.
    - **Temperature probes** and **urinary catheter** should be placed.
    - **Antibiotics** are administered per local guidelines.
    - Anesthesia maintenance may use a **volatile agent** or **total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA)**, especially during rigid bronchoscopy.
2. **Position**:
    
    - The patient is positioned in **lateral decubitus** with careful attention to eye protection, pressure points, and neck alignment.
    - **Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis** is provided using graduated compression stockings, and **normothermia** is maintained with a warming blanket and fluid warmer.
3. **Lung Isolation**:
    
    - The operative lung is collapsed, typically with a **double lumen tube (DLT)**, or alternatively a **bronchial blocker** if DLT placement is difficult.
    - **Fibreoptic bronchoscopy** is used to confirm positioning, with particular attention to the **right upper lobe** in right-sided DLTs.
    - **One-lung ventilation (OLV)** should begin before thoracotomy. Lung-protective strategies during OLV include low tidal volumes and sufficient PEEP.
    
    **Suggested OLV ventilatory targets**:
    
    - Tidal volume: 5–6 mL/kg (ideal body weight)
    - Peak airway pressure: <35 cm H₂O
    - Plateau airway pressure: <25 cm H₂O
    - PEEP: 5 cm H₂O
    - Maintain oxygen saturation at 94–98% (avoid hyperoxia)

### Haemodynamic Management

- **Clamping of the pulmonary artery** causes the entire pulmonary circulation to divert through the remaining lung. **Fluid management** is crucial to avoid both hypovolemia and excessive fluid, which increases the risk of post-pneumonectomy pulmonary oedema (PPO). Fluid restriction targets include:
    - Positive fluid balance within 24 hours not exceeding 20 mL/kg
    - Urine output ≥0.5 mL/kg/h should be accepted
    - Intraoperative fluid restricted to the previous hour's urine output plus 20 mL/h
    - Hypotension due to **epidural** should be treated with **vasoactive drugs**, not fluids.

### Pulmonary Artery Clamping Test

- **Final test** for suitability for pneumonectomy is clamping of the ipsilateral pulmonary artery.
    - Significant **cardiovascular collapse** or elevated **central venous pressure (CVP)** indicates right ventricular failure and a high risk of postoperative cardiac complications.
    - If physiological deterioration occurs and other causes (e.g., surgical compression) are excluded, the surgical team must reconsider continuing the procedure.

### Postoperative Care

1. **Extubation**:
    
    - The patient should be extubated awake, warm, and comfortable before transfer to a **postoperative care unit**.
2. **Pain Management and Monitoring**:
    
    - Adequate analgesia (epidural/paravertebral) is essential for effective coughing and secretion clearance.
    - **Invasive monitoring** for blood pressure allows for titration of **vasoconstrictors**.
    - Early detection and treatment of complications such as haemorrhage, PPO, and cardiac arrhythmias are crucial.
3. **Chest Drain Management**:
    
    - The drain is clamped at the end of surgery and opened briefly every hour to check for bleeding.
    - Prolonged drain opening can cause **mediastinal shift** and cardiovascular instability.
    - The drain is usually removed on postoperative day 1, allowing the hemithorax to accumulate serous fluid.
4. **Ward Transfer and Recovery**:
    
    - Uncomplicated patients typically step down to a **thoracic surgical ward** by day 2 and are discharged within 7–10 days.
    - **Physiotherapy** and **incentive spirometry** help reduce postoperative pulmonary complications.
