# Pulmonary Edema
## Basic Mechanism and Classification

- **Definition**: Pulmonary edema is the accumulation of fluid in the lung interstitium and alveoli, caused by leakage of intravascular fluid.
- **Types**:
	1. **Hydrostatic (Cardiogenic) Pulmonary Edema**:
		- **Cause**: Increased capillary pressure due to elevated hydrostatic forces.
		- **Mechanism**: Commonly occurs due to left ventricular failure, leading to increased pulmonary venous pressure and fluid translocation into the alveoli.
	2. **Increased Capillary Permeability (Non-Cardiogenic) Pulmonary Edema**:
		- **Cause**: Increased permeability of the pulmonary capillaries.
		- **Mechanism**: Often a result of direct injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane from factors such as infections, inhaled toxins, or systemic inflammatory responses.
	3. **Pulmonary Vasoconstriction**:
		- **Mechanism**: Increases capillary pressure, leading to fluid translocation into the alveoli.
		- **Examples**:
			- **Neurogenic**: Can occur following acute brain injuries.
			- **Drugs**: Certain substances like cocaine can induce vasoconstriction and subsequent pulmonary edema.

## CXR Features

- **Cardiomegaly**
	- Cardiothoracic Ratio (CTR) = 18/30 (>50%)
- **Upper Zone Vessel Enlargement**
	- Sign of pulmonary venous hypertension
- **Septal (Kerley B) Lines**
	- Sign of interstitial oedema
- **Airspace Shadowing**
	- Due to alveolar oedema, acutely in a peri-hilar (bat's wing) distribution
- **Blunt Costophrenic Angles**
	- Due to pleural effusions

# Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema

## Pathophysiology
- Acutely reduced forward flow and subsequent neurohumoral activation augment LAP; pulmonary capillary engorgement promotes alveolar haemorrhage and oedema
### Understanding the Ventricular Pressure-Volume Loops in Normal and Pathological Conditions

#### Key Points

- **End-Systolic Elastance (Ees)**:
	
	- Steeper slope indicates higher contractility.
	- Depressed ventricular contractility leads to a reduced Ees, and thus, a reduced stroke volume.
- **Effective Arterial Elastance (Ea)**:
	
	- Represents the arterial load the ventricle must overcome to eject blood.
	- Increased Ea indicates increased arterial impedance, resulting in higher ventricular pressure to eject the same volume of blood.
	- Therapies that reduce arterial impedance can decrease Ea and restore SV.

#### Pathological Implications

- **Reduced Ventricular Compliance**:
	
	- Reduces EDV and SV while EDV is maintained at the expense of elevated end-diastolic pressure (frequently seen in heart failure).
	- Nitrates and diuretics lower EDV and hence end-diastolic pressure (EDP); this has the desired effect of lowering left atrial pressure (LAP) and limiting pulmonary congestion but may reduce preload and SV.
- **Increased Arterial Impedance**:
	
	- Increases the ventricular pressure required to eject blood and decreases SV.
	- Therapies that reduce arterial impedance (e.g., nitrates, restoration of coronary perfusion) can reduce Ea and restore SV.
- **Depressed Ventricular Contractility**:
	
	- Leads to reduced Ees and thus a reduced SV.
	- Therapies that improve contractility (e.g., inotropes) can restore Ees and ventricular ejection pressure, decreasing ESV and boosting SV.
- **Elevated Left Atrial Pressure (LAP)**:
	
	- Seen in the right shift of the EDV due to elevated LAP, indicative of heart failure and fluid overload.

#### Summary

- **Normal Conditions**: Balance between ventricular contractility (Ees) and arterial impedance (Ea) ensures effective stroke volume and pressure.
- **Pathological Conditions**: Disruptions in Ees or Ea lead to reduced SV and elevated ventricular pressures.
- **Therapeutic Interventions**: Aim to restore the balance by reducing arterial impedance, improving ventricular contractility, and managing preload and afterload to optimize cardiac output and reduce congestion.

# Negative Pressure Pulmonary Edema (NPPE)

## Pathogenesis

- **Cause**: Generation of high negative intrathoracic pressures in an attempt to overcome airway obstruction.
- **Hydrostatic Mechanism**:
	- **Increased Preload and LV Afterload**: Augmented venous return due to high negative pressures.
	- **Hypoxia**: Causes hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) and decreased myocardial contractility, increasing pulmonary pressure.
	- **Sympathetic Tone**: Increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) due to sympathetic stimulation.
- **Mechanical Stress Mechanism**:
	- Reduced microvascular integrity leads to increased permeability.

## Pathophysiology

1. **Hypoxia**:
	- Detected by peripheral chemoreceptors, triggering sympathetic stimulation.
2. **Airway Obstruction**:
	- Commonly due to involuntary biting of the endotracheal (ET) tube or laryngospasm.
	- Patient attempts to inspire forcefully against the obstruction, causing highly negative intrathoracic pressure.
3. **Acute Increase in Systemic Venous Return to Right Heart**:
	- Increases pulmonary blood volume, raising pulmonary arterial and capillary pressure.
	- Leads to increased pulmonary interstitial pressure and trans-capillary pressure gradient.
4. **Fluid Movement**:
	- Fluid is pushed out of pulmonary capillaries into the interstitium, causing NPPE.

## Mechanisms and Effects

- **Fluid Surrounds Alveoli**:
	- Decreases diffusion of alveolar O2 into pulmonary capillaries.
- **Severe Cases**:
	- Pressure and fluid build-up damage capillaries and alveolar walls.
	- Fluid and red blood cells enter alveoli, potentially being coughed up as frothy pink sputum.

## Signs, Symptoms, and Lab Findings

- **Chest X-Ray (CXR)**:
	- Shows diffuse bilateral infiltrates.
- **Blood Gases**:
	- Decreased PaO2 and oxygen saturation (Sats).
## Management of NPPE

1. **Maintain a Patent Airway**:
	- Oxygen supplementation.
	- PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) / NIV (Noninvasive Ventilation) guided by physical examination and ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) results.
2. **Mechanical Ventilation**:
	- Reserved for severe cases that do not respond to NIV.
3. **Preload Reduction**:
	- Use GTN (Glyceryl Trinitrate) if adequate blood pressure (e.g., SBP >100 mmHg).
	- May also provide beneficial afterload reduction effects.
4. **Diuretics**:
	- Often used, but there is no evidence of their utility and may exacerbate hypovolemia and hypoperfusion.
5. **Clinical Course**:
	- NPPE usually resolves rapidly within 12-48 hours when recognized early and treated immediately.

This comprehensive understanding of NPPE, from pathogenesis to management, is crucial for effective intervention and improved patient outcomes.
