# Acute Rheumatic Fever

[Acute rheumatic fever](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Acute-Rheumatic-Fever--Pathogenesis-and-Clinical-Findings/)

## Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

### Overview

- **Pathogenesis**:
	- Untreated GAS Pharyngitis
	- Environmental Factors
	- Genetic Susceptibility

### Pathogenesis

1. **Initial Event**:
	- Untreated Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis
2. **Delayed Autoimmune Reaction**:
	- Triggered by molecular mimicry where GAS antigen cross-reacts with host tissues
3. **Activation of Immune Response**:
	- Activation of auto-reactive B and CD-4+ T cells
4. **Tissue Injury and Inflammation**:
	- **Outcomes**:
		- **Clinical Findings**:
			- Fever
			- Arthralgia
			- Erythema Marginatum
			- Subcutaneous Nodules (Osler’s Nodes)
			- Increased ESR and CRP
		- **Mechanisms**:
			- Antibodies recognize ganglioside and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine, targeting neuronal cell surfaces, leading to Sydenham's Chorea via cell signaling and dopamine release.
			- Antibodies attach to myosin and other cardiac proteins. Lymphocytes adhere to these proteins causing pancarditis and valvular injury, resulting in carditis and prolonged PR interval.

### Genetic and Environmental Factors

- **Genetic Susceptibility**:
	- Polygenic, involving HLA-DR7 and other class II MHC alleles.
	- Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for TNF-alpha and Mannan-binding lectin.
- **Environmental Risk Factors**:
	- Overcrowding
	- Poverty
	- Malnutrition
	- Maternal unemployment
	- Low level of maternal education

### Prevention

- Treatment of GAS pharyngitis with a full course of antibiotics can reduce the risk of developing rheumatic fever.

### Long-term Sequelae

- Rheumatic heart disease, commonly valvulopathy.
- Jaccoud arthropathy: a benign chronic arthropathy causing joint and tendon loosening in hands/feet.

## Diagnosis

- **Definition of Low-Risk Population**:
	- Cases of acute RF ≤ 2/100,000 school-age children or rheumatic heart disease.

### Echocardiographic Criteria (AHA 2012)

#### Doppler Criteria

- **Pathological Mitral Regurgitation** (all must be met):
	
	1. Visible in at least 2 projections.
	2. Regurgitation jet length ≥ 2 cm in at least 1 projection.
	3. Regurgitation peak velocity > 3 m/s.
	4. Regurgitation pansystolic.
- **Pathological Aortic Regurgitation** (all must be met):
	
	1. Visible in at least 2 projections.
	2. Regurgitation jet length ≥ 1 cm in at least 1 projection.
	3. Regurgitation peak velocity > 3 m/s.
	4. Regurgitation pandiastolic.

#### Morphological Criteria

- **Acute Mitral Valve Involvement**:
	
	1. Dilatation of mitral annulus.
	2. Elongation of chordae tendineae.
	3. Rupture of chorda tendinea with acute mitral regurgitation.
	4. Prolapse of anterior (less often posterior) leaflet.
	5. Nodular lesions on leaflets.
- **Chronic Mitral Valve Involvement**:
	
	1. Thickening of leaflets.
	2. Thickening and fusion of chordae tendineae.
	3. Limited leaflet mobility.
	4. Calcifications.
- **Acute and Chronic Aortic Valve Involvement**:
	
	1. Symmetrical or focal thickening of leaflets.
	2. Disturbed leaflet coaptation.
	3. Limited leaflet mobility.
	4. Prolapse of leaflets.

## Treatment

### Anti-streptococcal Treatment (Primary and Secondary Prevention)

- **Primary**:
	
	- Phenoxymethylpenicillin for 10 days.
	- Allergy: First-generation cephalosporins.
	- Alternative: Macrolides.
- **Secondary Prevention**:
	
	- Phenoxymethylpenicillin, benzathine benzylpenicillin, or macrolide.
	- Duration: from the last RF relapse or up to 21 years of age (whichever is longer).
	- In cases with carditis leading to chronic valvular heart disease: 10 years or until 40 years of age (whichever is longer).
	- Dosage: Phenoxymethylpenicillin orally at 2 × 250 mg.

### Anti-inflammatory Treatment

- **Prednisone**:
	- Dosage: 1–2 mg/kg/day for 2–3 weeks, then taper gradually.
	- Total duration: 6 weeks.
