## Donor Management

### Conventional Management

- **Adjust Volume Status:**
	- Target CVP: 6-10 mmHg
- **Correct Acidosis:**
	- Target pH: 7.40-7.45
- **Correct Hypoxemia:**
	- Target pO₂: >80 mmHg
	- O₂ saturation: >95%

### Obtain Initial Echo

- **Rule Out Structural Abnormalities:**
	- Substantial left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
	- Valvular dysfunction
	- Congenital lesions

### Evaluate Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF)

- **LVEF ≥45%:**
	- Proceed with recovery for transplantation
- **LVEF <45%:**
	- **Hormonal Resuscitation:**
		- **T3:** 4 µg bolus + infusion at 3 µg/hour
		- **Vasopressin:** 1 unit bolus + infusion at 0.5-4 units/hour
			- Titrate to SVR: 800-1200

### Decision Making Based on Criteria

- **Criteria Met:**
	- Proceed with recovery
- **Criteria Not Met:**
	- Do not recover heart for transplantation

## Conduct of Anaesthesia

### Pre-op
- Review investigations and imaging: Any change since last evaluation?
- Coagulation status: Reverse if necessary
- Implantable devices: Reprogram as required
- Commence antibiotics and immunosuppressants pre-op
#### Side Effects of Immunosuppressive Therapy

- Cyclosporine-induced hypertension and nephrotoxicity
- Steroids causing glucose intolerance and skeletal demineralization
- Possible pacemaker in situ for bradyarrhythmia

### Monitors
- Standard / LBIV / IBP / CVC
	- Adjust CVP when heart removed and donor inserted
	- Left IJ for CVP (allows easy access for biopsies via right IJ in post-op period)
- PAC can be used to evaluate PVR (↑ PVR indicates high risk of RV failure post-transplant)
- Redo's: Defib pads and blood ready
### Intra-op

- **Aspiration:**
	- Likely full stomach
- **Drugs Intra-op:**
	- Avoid nitrous (risk of pulmonary hypertension and air embolism)
	- Immunosuppressive therapy initiated intraoperatively with strict asepsis
- **Coagulation:**
	- Address coagulation disturbances due to liver congestion

#### Haemodynamic Principles
- **Aim:** Minimize changes in preload, contractility, and afterload
	- End-stage CMO patients have ↓ contractility, preload dependence, and afterload sensitivity
- **Blood and Blood Products:** Address acquired factor XIII and vWF deficiency
- **TXA:** For coagulation support
- **RV Dysfunction:** (dilation, ↓WM, TR ± leftward intra-atrial septal shift on TOE)
	- Source: Lung TXP
- **Denervated Heart:** Initially paced at 100 bpm and supported with catecholamines

### Physiology of the Transplanted Heart

- The transplanted heart is a denervated organ, but intrinsic cardiac mechanisms are preserved.
- **Key Points:**
	- Sensitive to changes in filling conditions
	- Starling volume–pressure relationship paramount in adjusting contractility
	- High resting heart rate (90–100 bpm)
	- Blunted tachycardia response to physiological stress
	- No response to atropine or glycopyrrolate
	- Possible reinnervation over time
	- Increased risk of bradycardia and hypotension due to intrinsic stretch-related impairment or acute ischaemia of the sinoatrial node
	- Higher rate of cardiac dysrhythmias
	- Frequent conduction abnormalities

#### Haemodynamic Responses Summary

- **Denervated:**
	- Blunted responses to pain
	- Slow tachycardiac response to hypovolemia
	- No experience of angina
	- Direct sympathomimetics work normally
- **Preload Dependent:**
	- Adequate preoperative hydration and maintained intraoperative intravascular volume
	- Haemodynamic monitoring and TOE
	- Regional anesthesia usually avoided due to impaired hypotensive response

[View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.](https://whimsical.com/cardiac-transplanted-patient-EyMmeJjhbH3aoeexRc1cy6?ref=chatgpt)

### Key Points

1. **Full Cardiac Assessment:**
   - Includes echocardiography (ECHO).

2. **Anatomical Issues:**
   - Patency of great veins and central venous access.

3. **Accelerated Atherosclerosis:**
   - Possible stent presence, impacting anti-platelet management.

4. **Peri-operative Management:**
   - Comorbidities and chronic medications.

5. **Autonomic Denervation:**
   - Fixed moderately elevated resting HR, partial re-innervation over time, and responsiveness to catecholamines.

6. **Psychological Morbidity:**
   - Management with antidepressants or antipsychotics.

### Extended Version

A transplant team will carefully monitor each heart transplant recipient and should be contacted whenever possible to seek information on the patient’s overall status.

#### Preoperative

- **History:**
  - Consult the transplant team for recent investigations (ECG for graft function, recent biopsy for rejection, angiography for coronaries).
  - Determine CMV status and inform the blood bank.
  - By 3 months, most recipients achieve NYHA I class.
  - UK national survey indicates quality of life improvement post-transplant: 60% much better, 28% somewhat better, with no general health deterioration at 3-5 years, though many experience depression.
- **Electrophysiology:**
  - Preoperative ECG and continuous monitoring during the operation and recovery.
  - Presence of double P waves; one from the remnant recipient atrium.
  - Up to 5% may have a pacemaker.
- **Echocardiography:**
  - Assess left and right ventricular function.
- **Laboratory:**
  - U&E, inflammatory markers, coagulation, FBC.
  - BNP measurement may be considered for allograft rejection surveillance.
- **Miscellaneous:**
  - If ciclosporin cannot be administered enterally post-surgery, the IV dose is a third to a quarter of the oral dose.
  - Monitor renal function and liaise with the transplant team for minimizing toxicity.

#### Intraoperative Management

- **Anaesthetic Technique:**
  - Premedication as usual.
  - Choice of technique (general or loco-regional) should maintain preload.
  - Epidural may offer better control of vascular tone than subarachnoid block.
- **Airway Management and Ventilation:**
  - Oral intubation preferred due to infection risk from nasal flora.
  - Gingival hyperplasia from ciclosporin increases bleeding risk during airway manipulation.
  - Airway obstructions may result from diabetes and lymphoproliferative disorders.
  - No formal contraindication to LMA use.
  - Avoid hyperventilation; ciclosporin and tacrolimus lower seizure threshold.
  - Use muscle relaxants like cisatracurium, which are not affected by renal or liver dysfunction.
- **Haemodynamic Control:**
  - Monitor for large fluid shifts; consider cardiac output monitoring and IBP.
  - Noninvasive cardiac output monitoring may be useful.
  - Transoesophageal echocardiography recommended.
  - Use drugs with direct pressor or chronotropic effects: isoproterenol, ephedrine, metaraminol, adrenaline.
  - Amiodarone or verapamil for tachyarrhythmias.
  - Levosimendan may improve ejection fraction without altering intracellular calcium.
  - Avoid beta-blockers; use nitroglycerin or nitroprusside with caution.
- **Miscellaneous:**
  - Careful positioning due to frail musculoskeletal structure.
  - Intraoperative steroid supplementation may be required for patients on long-term steroids.

#### Postoperative Care

- Similar to non-transplanted patients with enhanced attention to preload, renal function, infection, and coagulation.
- Administer thromboprophylaxis due to high DVT risk.
- Continue and monitor immunosuppression therapy.
#### Complications

- Infection
- Rejection
- Antirejection drug effects: diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension
- Cholelithiasis, pancreatitis
- Pre-eclampsia in pregnant patients
- Chronic allograft vasculopathy

#### Rejection

- Up to 40% experience acute rejection in the first year
- Less frequent after the first year but can occur with non-compliance

##### Diagnosis

- Bradycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, fatigue, fever, unexplained weight gain, peripheral edema, dyspnea

##### Investigations

- Endomyocardial biopsy (confirm diagnosis, graded by ISHLT guidelines)

##### Prevention

- Immunosuppression as cornerstone
- Novel strategies: statins, apolipoproteins, omega-3 fatty acids
- Regular surveillance biopsies

##### Treatment

- Increased immunosuppression
- IV immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis for antibody-mediated rejection
- Mechanical support for severe cases until recovery

## Contraindications to Lung Transplantation

### Absolute Contraindications

- Recent malignancy (5-year disease-free period for any major malignancy)
- Untreatable major organ dysfunction not paired with another transplant
- Uncorrected atherosclerotic disease with end-organ dysfunction and CAD not amenable to revascularization
- Acute medical instability (e.g., sepsis, myocardial infarction, liver failure)
- Uncorrectable bleeding diathesis
- Chronic infection with highly virulent and/or resistant microbe that is poorly controlled pre-transplant
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection
- Significant chest wall deformity expected to cause severe restriction
- BMI ≥35
- Current or prolonged past medical non-adherence
- Psychiatric or psychological condition that results in an inability to cooperate with medical care
- Absence of an adequate social support system
- Severely limited functional status with poor rehabilitation potential

### Relative Contraindications

- Age >65 with low physiologic reserve and age >75 is unlikely to be successful
## Pulmonary Concerns

- **Pulmonary Dysfunction in Liver Disease:** Affects up to 50% of patients with liver disease.
  - Major concerns include:
	- Refractory hepatic hydrothorax
	- Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS)
	- Porto pulmonary hypertension (POPH)
	- Hemorrhagic hereditary telangiectasia
	- Interstitial lung disease
	- Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency-related emphysema
- **Pulmonary Vascular Endothelium:**
  - Vital for Vaso regulation, fluidity, antithrombosis, laminar blood flow, permeability, and growth of surrounding smooth muscle.
  - Exposed to inflammatory cytokines and stress forces due to portal hypertension, leading to endothelial dysfunction:
	- Vasodilatory pulmonary circulation (HPS)
	- Restrictive, vasoconstrictive circulation (POPH)
- **Hepatopulmonary Syndrome (HPS):**
  - Characterized by:
	- Decreased oxygen saturation
	- Presence of advanced liver disease
	- Intrapulmonary vascular dilatation
  - Present in 5% to 30% of patients evaluated for liver transplant.
  - Pulmonary arteriovenous shunts and capillary vasodilation lead to reduced capillary transit time and diminished oxygen diffusion, resulting in unsaturated red cells.
  - **Screening and Diagnosis:**
	- Pulse oximetry: Oxygen saturations (SpO₂) <96% require further evaluation.
	- Transthoracic echocardiography: Shows delayed right-to-left shunt using agitated saline (contrast microbubbles appear in the left heart after 3-6 heartbeats).
	- Increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient ≥15 mm Hg while breathing room air in the sitting position.
	- Clinical signs: Digital clubbing, cyanosis, platypnea (dyspnea worse when upright).
  - **Prognosis and Treatment:**
	- Patients with HPS have a two-fold increased risk of mortality compared to cirrhotic patients without HPS.
	- Granted MELD exception points for higher waitlist priority.
	- No medical treatment; condition is reversible after liver transplant.

|                                                                  | Severe hypercapnia                                              | May require higher airway pressures                                        |
|                                                                  | Difficult dissection due to prior thoracic procedures           | May require higher level of PEEP (8-10 cm H₂O) and frequent suctioning     |
| **Restrictive (pulmonary fibrosis, hypersensitivity pneumonia)** | Severe pulmonary hypertension                                   | May need high peak inspiratory pressures (40 cm H₂O)                       |
|                                                                  | May not tolerate OLV                                            | Maximize inspiratory time (I:E = 1:1-1:2)                                  |

|                                                                  |                                                                 | Inotropic/vasopressor/inhaled pulmonary vasodilators on induction          |
|                                                                  |                                                                 | Continue perioperative intravenous prostanoids                             |
|                                                                  |                                                                 | Mechanical circulatory support if necessary                                |

**If unable to tolerate induction**, consider ECMO, pulmonary artery clamping, OLV, or intra-op CPB.

#### Ventilation of Transplanted Lungs

- **Tidal Volume:** 6 mL/kg ideal body weight (IBW). Adjust for one-lung ventilation (OLV) if needed. Consider using donor body weight if the allograft is undersized.
- **PEEP:** 6 to 8 cm H₂O.
- **PIP:** Less than 30 cm H₂O.
- **Recruitment Maneuvers:** Careful recruitment maneuvers.
- **FiO₂:** Lowest FiO₂ to maintain PaO₂ ≥70 mm Hg.
- **Permissive Hypercapnia:** Normocapnia or low levels of permissive hypercapnia if it allows for low tidal volume (Vt) and is not associated with acidosis.
- **Airway Clearance:** Bronchoscopic airway clearance.

#### OLV in Recipient
1. Tidal volumes of 4-6 ml/kg of ideal body weight.
2. Titrate PEEP to best compliance (e.g., 3-10 cm H₂O).
3. Target Plateau pressure < 30 cm H₂O or driving pressure < 14 cm H₂O.

#### CPB

##### Advantages
1. Familiar, effective, well-tolerated technique.
2. Allows for simultaneous cardiac surgery.
3. Capacity to add volume and manage emergency bleeding.

##### Disadvantages
1. Associated with prolonged post-op ventilation.
2. Associated with pulmonary edema.
3. Linked to primary graft dysfunction.

#### ECMO

##### Advantages
1. Full heparinization not required.
2. Reduced bleeding.
3. Reduced blood product utilization.
4. Reduced re-operation rates.
5. Can be used as a bridge to transplantation.

##### Disadvantages

1. Decreased survival, especially if bridging for >14 days.
2. Increased primary graft dysfunction.
3. Reduced capacity to add volume and manage emergency bleeding (vs. bypass).

#### Immunosuppression
1. **Tacrolimus:** 1 mg sublingual (or 0.5 mg for patients >65 years) before transplantation at the time the donor lungs are deemed acceptable and the decision to proceed with transplant is made.
2. **Basiliximab:** 20 mg administered intraoperatively.
3. **Mycophenolate mofetil:** 1000 mg administered intraoperatively.
4. **Solumedrol:** 500 mg IV on induction.

### Complications
#### Reperfusion Injury
- The most common cause of death in the immediate postoperative period is graft dysfunction from reperfusion injury.
- Approximately 90% of transplanted patients develop various degrees of ischemia-reperfusion injury in the first postoperative hours, presenting as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema with:
  - Hypoxemia
  - Pulmonary infiltrates
  - Poor lung compliance
  - Pulmonary hypertension
  - Right ventricular failure (exclude pulmonary vein thrombosis)
- **Treatment:** Supportive with high levels of PEEP and FiO2, inhaled nitric oxide, other pulmonary vasodilators (e.g., nitroglycerin, PGE1), and ECMO in severe cases.

## Anaesthetic Concerns in Recipients of Lung Transplants Presenting for Non-Transplant Surgery

1. **Opportunistic Infections**
2. **Bronchiolitis Obliterans:** Pulmonary function test usually preserved.
3. **Anatomical Derangement**
4. **Renal Function Decline:** Possibly due to calcineurin inhibitors.

### Considerations
- **Allograft Physiology:** Heterogeneous compliance, impaired cough, disrupted lymphatics.
- **Differential Lung Ventilation:** If single lung transplant.
- **Extrapulmonary Features:** Pulmonary hypertension, RV failure from underlying disease (e.g., sarcoidosis, cystic fibrosis).
- **Complications:** Allograft rejection, vascular and bronchial anastomotic complications.
- **Immunosuppression:** Strict aseptic techniques, watch for infection, side effects on hematologic, renal, and hepatic systems.

### Goals/Conflict
- Assess allograft function, anastomotic integrity, and end-organ function.
- Employ regional/neuraxial anesthesia if feasible.
- **If Endotracheal Intubation & PPV Required:**
  - Consider differential lung ventilation.
  - Lung protective ventilation to allograft and CPAP with 100% oxygen to native lung.
  - Restrictive fluid strategy.
- Use strict aseptic techniques, avoid manipulation of airways, and administer prophylactic antibiotics.
