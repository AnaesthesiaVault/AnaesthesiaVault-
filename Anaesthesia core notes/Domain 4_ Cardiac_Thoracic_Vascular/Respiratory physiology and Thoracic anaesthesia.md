# Function Anatomy

## Rib Cage & Muscles of Respiration

### Inhalation
- **Diaphragm Contraction:** The diaphragm, the principal pulmonary muscle, descends 1.5 to 7 cm during contraction, expanding the lungs and increasing the thoracic cavity volume. Diaphragmatic movement accounts for 75% of the chest volume change.
- **Accessory Respiratory Muscles:** The external intercostal muscles, sternocleidomastoid, scalene, and pectoralis muscles assist in increasing chest volume by their actions on the ribs.
- **Rib Articulation and Movement:** Each rib, except the last two, articulates posteriorly with a vertebra and is angled downward anteriorly. Upward and outward rib movement expands the chest.
- **Muscle Role in Breathing:** During normal breathing, the diaphragm and, to a lesser extent, the external intercostal muscles are primarily responsible for inspiration, while expiration is generally passive. Some pharyngeal muscles maintain airway patency.
### Exhalation
- **Passive:** Normal exhalation is generally passive.
- **Facilitated Exhalation:** Exhalation can be aided by the abdominal muscles (rectus abdominis, external and internal oblique, transversus) and possibly by the internal intercostal muscles, which help in rib downward movement.
## Tracheobronchial Tree
- **Trachea:** Serves as a conduit for ventilation and secretion clearance, beginning at the cricoid cartilage and extending to the carina, with an average length of 10 to 13 cm.
- **Anatomy:** Composed of C-shaped cartilaginous rings connected by the membranous wall posteriorly. The cricoid cartilage is the narrowest part in adults.
- **Bronchi:** The trachea bifurcates into the right and left mainstem bronchi at the sternal angle. The right bronchus lies more linear with the trachea, while the left bronchus is more angular.
- **Branching:** The right mainstem bronchus continues as the bronchus intermedius after the right upper lobe bronchus take-off, while the left mainstem bronchus divides into the left upper and lower lobe bronchi.
- **Function:** Humidification and filtering of inspired air occur in the upper airway, and gas flow conduction occurs in the tracheobronchial tree. The tree undergoes approximately 23 divisions or generations from the trachea to the alveolar sacs.
### Histology
- **Mucosa Transition:** From ciliated columnar to cuboidal and finally to flat alveolar epithelium, where gas exchange occurs.
- **Structural Support:** Cartilaginous support is lost at the bronchioles, and airway patency depends on radial traction from the elastic recoil of surrounding tissue.
- **Cilia Function:** Beat synchronously to move mucus and debris toward the mouth.
## Alveoli
- **Size Variation:** Alveolar size depends on gravity and lung volume, with the largest alveoli at the pulmonary apex in the upright position.
- **Gas Exchange:** Occurs primarily on the thin side of the alveolocapillary membrane, less than 0.4 μm thick, while the thick side provides structural support.
- **Pneumocytes:** Type I pneumocytes form tight junctions, preventing large molecules' passage. Type II pneumocytes produce surfactant and can divide to replace type I cells.
- **Other Cells:** Include macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes, APUD cells, and neutrophils (in smokers and patients with pneumonia or acute lung injury).
## Circulation and Lymphatics
- **Pulmonary and Bronchial Circulations:** The bronchial circulation arises from the thoracic aorta and supplies the tracheobronchial tree, while the pulmonary circulation receives the total output of the right heart and facilitates gas exchange in the alveoli.
- **Capillaries:** Incorporated into alveolar walls, with an average diameter allowing single red cell passage. Flow is affected by gravity and alveolar size.
- **Lymphatics:** Originate in interstitial spaces and return fluids, proteins, and cells to blood circulation. Pulmonary lymph has high protein content, and lymphatic vessels travel alongside airways to form the tracheobronchial chain of lymph nodes.
## Innervation
- **Diaphragm Innervation:** Motor and sensory innervation by the phrenic nerves (C3–C5). Peripheral diaphragm sensory innervation by the sixth through eleventh intercostal nerves.
- **Tracheobronchial Tree Innervation:** Sensory innervation by the vagus nerves. Autonomic innervation includes parasympathetic (bronchoconstriction and secretion increase) and sympathetic (bronchodilation and secretion decrease) influences.
- **Vascular Innervation:** Sympathetic activity (T1–T4) influences bronchodilation via β2-receptors, while parasympathetic vasodilatory activity is mediated by nitric oxide release.
# Mechanism of Breathing
- **Gas Exchange:** Alveolar gas exchange with fresh upper airway gas reoxygenates blood and eliminates CO2, driven by small cyclic pressure gradients.
- **Pressure Gradients:** During spontaneous ventilation, intrathoracic pressure variations create these gradients. During mechanical ventilation, positive pressure in the upper airway produces them.
## Spontaneous Ventilation
- **Pressure Variations:** Intrathoracic and alveolar pressures change during normal breathing. At end-inspiration, alveolar pressure is atmospheric, and intrapleural pressure is about–8 to–9 cm H2O.
- **Transpulmonary Pressure:** Defined as the difference between alveolar and intrapleural pressure. Diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle activation during inspiration decreases intrapleural pressure, establishing an alveolar-upper airway gradient.
# Lung Mechanics
- **Passive Movement:** Determined by respiratory system impedance, divided into elastic and nonelastic resistance.
## Elastic Resistance
- **Chest Wall and Lungs:** The chest tends to expand outward, and the lungs tend to collapse. Elastic recoil properties stem from structural components and muscle tone for the chest, and elastin fibers and surface tension forces for the lungs.
- **Surface Tension Forces:** Alveoli behave like bubbles, with surfactant reducing surface tension in proportion to its concentration, stabilizing alveolar size.
### Compliance
- **Definition:** Elastic recoil measured as the change in volume divided by the change in distending pressure.
- **Lung Compliance (CL):** Affected by lung volume, blood volume, extravascular lung water, and pathological processes. Normal CL is 150 to 200 mL/cm H2O.
- **Chest Wall Compliance (CW):** Reduced in the supine position due to abdominal contents' weight. Total compliance (lung and chest wall) is expressed by 1/Ctotal = 1/CW + 1/CL, with normal chest wall compliance being 200 mL/cm H2O and total compliance being 100 mL/cm H2O.
### Lung Volumes

| Measurement                            | Definition                                                         | Average Adult Values (mL) |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>)**       | Each normal breath                                                 | 500                       |
| **Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)**   | Maximal additional volume that can be inspired above V<sub>T</sub> | 3000                      |
| **Expiratory reserve volume (ERV)**    | Maximal volume that can be expired below V<sub>T</sub>             | 1100                      |
| **Residual volume (RV)**               | Volume remaining after maximal exhalation                          | 1200                      |
| **Total lung capacity (TLC)**          | RV + ERV + V<sub>T</sub> + IRV                                     | 5800                      |
| **Functional residual capacity (FRC)** | RV + ERV                                                           | 2300                      |

#### Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)
- The lung volume at the end of a normal exhalation is called functional residual capacity (FRC).
  - At this volume, the inward elastic recoil of the lung approximates the outward elastic recoil of the chest (including resting diaphragmatic tone).
  - The elastic properties of both the chest and lung define the point from which normal breathing takes place.
  - FRC can be measured by nitrogen washout, helium wash-in technique, or body plethysmography.
- **Factors Affecting FRC:**
  - **Body Habitus:**
	- FRC is directly proportional to height.
	- Obesity can markedly decrease FRC due to reduced chest wall compliance and increased abdominal pressure on the diaphragm.
	- Kyphosis can adversely impact both lung volumes and rib mobility.
  - **Sex:**
	- FRC is reduced by about 10% in females compared with males.
  - **Increased Intraabdominal Pressure:**
	- Decreased FRC is associated with laparoscopic procedures, pregnancy, and significant ascites due to increased pressure on the diaphragm from the laparoscopy pneumoperitoneum, the gravid uterus, or ascitic fluid.
  - **Posture:**
	- FRC decreases as a patient is moved from an upright to a supine or prone position.
	- This is due to reduced chest compliance as the abdominal contents push up against the diaphragm. The greatest change occurs between 0° and 60° of inclination.
  - **Lung Disease:**
	- Decreased compliance of the lung, chest, or both is characteristic of restrictive pulmonary disorders, all associated with a low FRC.
  - **Diaphragmatic Tone:**
	- Normally contributes to FRC, evident with unilateral or bilateral phrenic nerve paralysis.
#### Closing Capacity
- The lung volumes at which the smallest airways (respiratory bronchioles) collapse.
  - Small airways lacking cartilaginous support depend on radial traction from the elastic recoil of surrounding tissue to keep them open; patency of these airways, particularly in dependent areas of the lung, is highly dependent on lung volume.
  - The volume at which these airways begin to close in dependent areas of the lung is called the closing capacity.
  - At lower lung volumes, alveoli in dependent areas continue to be perfused but are no longer ventilated, leading to intrapulmonary shunting of deoxygenated blood (venous admixture), promoting hypoxemia.
- **Measurement:**
  - Closing capacity is measured with 100% oxygen, inhaled near residual volume and then exhaled from total lung capacity.
  - Changes in nitrogen concentration of the exhaled gas following oxygen inhalation are measured.
  - The nitrogen concentration from alveoli at the base of the lungs is lower than that at the apex because any air remaining in the lungs at the residual volume is in the nondependent alveoli.
  - Closing volume is discerned when the concentration of expired nitrogen rises, indicating that the alveoli from the dependent regions of the lung are no longer contributing to the exhaled gas because their airways have closed.
- **Changes with Age and Posture:**
  - Closing capacity is normally well below FRC but rises steadily with age.
  - This increase is probably responsible for the normal age-related decline in arterial O2 tension. For individuals around age 44, closing capacity equals FRC in the supine position; by age 66, closing capacity equals or exceeds FRC in the upright position for most individuals.
  - Unlike FRC, closing capacity is unaffected by posture. Closing capacity also approaches or exceeds FRC in morbid obesity.
### Vital Capacity (VC)
- **Definition:** Vital capacity (VC) is the maximum volume of gas that can be exhaled following maximal inspiration.
- **Dependence Factors:**
  - Body habitus
  - Respiratory muscle strength
  - Chest-lung compliance
- **Normal Values:** Normal VC is approximately 60 to 70 mL/kg.
## Nonelastic Resistances

### Airway Resistance to Gas Flow
- **Gas Flow in Lungs:** Gas flow in the lungs is a mixture of laminar and turbulent flow.
  - **Laminar Flow:** Consists of concentric cylinders of gas flowing at different velocities, with velocity greatest in the center and decreasing toward the periphery.
  - **Flow Equation:**
	Flow = Pressure/ Resistance
- **Resistance**
Raw​=(8 x Length ×Gas viscosity​)/ π×(Radius)<sup>4</sup>
#### Turbulent Flow

- **Characteristics:** Turbulent flow is characterized by the random movement of gas molecules down the air passages.
	- Mathematical description of turbulent flow is considerably more complex than that of laminar flow.
	- **Resistance in Turbulent Flow:** Resistance is not constant but increases in proportion to gas flow. It is directly proportional to gas density and inversely proportional to the fifth power of the radius.
		- This sensitivity to airway caliber makes turbulent gas flow extremely responsive to changes in airway diameter.
	- **Occurrence:** Turbulence generally occurs at high gas flows, at sharp angles or branching points, and in response to abrupt changes in airway diameter.
- **Reynolds Number:** Whether turbulent or laminar flow occurs can be predicted by the Reynolds number
Pressure gradient= (Flow<sup>2</sup> x Gas density}/ Radius<sup>5</sup>
#### Reynolds Number
- **Definition and Flow Type:**
  - A low Reynolds number (<1000) is associated with laminar flow.
  - A high Reynolds number (>1500) produces turbulent flow.
- **Location of Flow Types:**
  - Laminar flow normally occurs only distal to small bronchioles (<1 mm).
  - Flow in larger airways is probably turbulent.
- **Clinical Application:**
  - Helium has a significantly lower density-to-viscosity ratio compared to other gases used clinically.
  - Helium–O2 mixtures are useful in severe turbulent flow conditions, such as upper airway obstruction.
  - These mixtures are less likely to cause turbulent flow compared to pure O2 and reduce airway resistance when turbulent flow is present.
#### Airway Resistance
- **Normal Values:** Normal total airway resistance is about 0.5 to 2 cm H2O/L/s.
  - **Contributions to Resistance:**
	- The largest contribution to airway resistance comes from medium-sized bronchi (before the seventh generation).
	- Resistance in large bronchi is low due to their large diameters.
	- Resistance in small bronchi is low due to their large total cross-sectional area.
- **Causes of Increased Airway Resistance:**
  - Bronchospasm
  - Secretions
  - Mucosal edema
  - Volume-related or flow-related airway collapse
Reynolds number= (Linear velocity x Diameter x Gas density)/ (Gas viscosity)]
### Volume-Related Airway Collapse

- **Low Lung Volumes:**
  - At low lung volumes, the loss of radial traction increases the contribution of small airways to total resistance.
  - As a result, airway resistance becomes inversely proportional to lung volume.
- **Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP):**
  - Increasing lung volume up to normal levels using PEEP can reduce airway resistance.
### Volume-Related Airway Collapse

- **Low Lung Volumes:**
	
	- At low lung volumes, the loss of radial traction increases the contribution of small airways to total resistance.
	- As a result, airway resistance becomes inversely proportional to lung volume.
- **Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP):**
	
	- Increasing lung volume up to normal levels using PEEP can reduce airway resistance.
### Gas Flow Dynamics During Forced Exhalation

- **Forced Exhalation Characteristics:**
  - **Gas Flow (A):** During forced exhalation from total lung capacity with varying effort.
  - **Gas Flow (B):** During maximal effort from different lung volumes.
  - Terminal expiratory flows are effort independent, regardless of initial lung volume or effort.
- **Equal Pressure Point:**
  - The point along the airways where dynamic compression occurs.
  - Typically located beyond the 11th to 13th generation of bronchioles where cartilaginous support is absent.
  - Moves toward smaller airways as lung volume decreases.
  - Conditions like emphysema and asthma predispose patients to dynamic airway compression.
	- **Emphysema:** Destroys the elastic tissues supporting smaller airways.
	- **Asthma:** Bronchoconstriction and mucosal edema intensify airway collapse and promote reversal of transmural pressure gradients across airways.
	- Patients may terminate exhalation prematurely or purse their lips to increase expiratory resistance at the mouth.
	- Premature termination of exhalation may increase FRC above normal, resulting in air trapping and auto-PEEP.
### Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)

- **Measuring FVC:**
  - Measuring vital capacity as an exhalation that is as forceful and rapid as possible provides important information about airway resistance.
  - **FEV1/FVC Ratio:** The ratio of the forced expiratory volume in the first second of exhalation (FEV1) to the total forced vital capacity (FVC) is proportional to the degree of airway obstruction.
	- Normally, FEV1/FVC is 80% or greater.
	- Both FEV1 and FVC are effort dependent, but forced mid-expiratory flow (FEF25–75%) is more effort independent and may be a more reliable measurement of obstruction.
## Tissue Resistance
- **Nonelastic Resistance:**
  - Often underestimated and overlooked.
  - May account for up to half of total airway resistance.
  - Primarily due to viscoelastic (frictional) resistance of tissues to gas flow.
# Work of Breathing
- **General Characteristics:**
  - Expiration is normally entirely passive.
  - Both inspiratory and expiratory work of breathing is accomplished by the inspiratory muscles, primarily the diaphragm.
  - Three factors must be overcome during ventilation:
	1. Elastic recoil of the chest and lung.
	2. Frictional resistance to gas flow in the airways.
	3. Tissue frictional resistance.
  - Respiratory work can be expressed as the product of volume and pressure.
- **During Inhalation:**
  - Both inspiratory airway resistance and pulmonary elastic recoil must be overcome.
  - Nearly 50% of the energy expended is stored in pulmonary elastic recoil.
- **During Exhalation:**
  - Stored potential energy is released, overcoming expiratory airway resistance.
  - Increases in inspiratory or expiratory resistance are compensated by increased inspiratory muscle effort.
  - When expiratory resistance increases, the normal compensatory response is to increase lung volume so that tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) breathing occurs at an abnormally high functional residual capacity (FRC).
	- Greater elastic recoil energy stored at a higher lung volume overcomes the added expiratory resistance.
	- Excessive expiratory resistance also activates expiratory muscles.
- **Respiratory Muscle Efficiency:**
  - Normally, respiratory muscles account for only 2% to 3% of O<sub>2</sub> consumption, operating at about 10% efficiency.
  - Ninety percent of the work is dissipated as heat due to elastic and airflow resistance.
  - In pathological conditions that increase the load on the diaphragm, muscle efficiency decreases progressively, and contraction may become uncoordinated with increasing ventilatory effort.
  - A point may be reached whereby any increase in O<sub>2</sub> uptake, due to augmented ventilation, is consumed by the respiratory muscles themselves.
- **Work of Breathing Dynamics:**
  - The work required to overcome elastic resistance increases as V<sub>T</sub> increases.
  - The work required to overcome airflow resistance increases as respiratory rate (and, necessarily, expiratory flow) increases.
  - Patients minimize the work of breathing by altering respiratory rate and V<sub>T</sub>:
	- Patients with reduced compliance tend to have rapid, shallow breaths.
	- Patients with increased airflow resistance tend to have a slow, deep breathing pattern.
# Effects of Anesthesia on Pulmonary Mechanics

- **General Overview:**
  - The effects of anesthesia on breathing are complex and involve changes due to both position and anesthetic agents.
## Effects on Lung Volumes and Compliance
- **Initial Changes:**
  - General anesthesia induces changes in lung mechanics shortly after induction.
  - The supine position reduces FRC by 0.8 to 1.0 L.
  - Induction of general anesthesia further reduces FRC by 0.4 to 0.5 L.
- **Mechanisms:**
  - FRC reduction results from alveolar collapse and compression atelectasis due to loss of inspiratory muscle tone, change in chest wall rigidity, and upward shift of the diaphragm.
  - Only the dependent (dorsal) part of the diaphragm moves cephalad in the supine position.
  - Increased blood volume in the lung and changes in chest wall shape also contribute.
- **Long-term Effects:**
  - The decrease in FRC is not related to anesthetic depth and may persist for several hours or days post-anesthesia.
- **Position Effects:**
  - Trendelenburg position (>30°) further reduces FRC due to increased intrathoracic blood volume.
  - Anesthesia induction in the sitting position has little effect on FRC.
  - Muscle paralysis does not significantly change FRC in anesthetized patients.
- **Closing Capacity:**
  - Both FRC and closing capacity are reduced under anesthesia.
  - The risk of increased intrapulmonary shunting under anesthesia is similar to that in the conscious state, particularly in obese, older adult patients and those with pulmonary disease.
## Effects on Airway Resistance
- **FRC and Airway Resistance:**
  - Reduced FRC with general anesthesia might increase airway resistance.
  - However, inhalation anesthetics' bronchodilating properties usually prevent this.
  
- **Pathological Factors:**
  - Increased airway resistance is more commonly due to:
	- Posterior displacement of the tongue.
	- Laryngospasm.
	- Bronchoconstriction.
	- Secretions, blood, or tumors in the airway.
  - Equipment problems like small tracheal tubes, malfunctioning valves, or obstructions in the breathing circuit can also increase resistance.
## Effects on the Work of Breathing
- **Increased Work of Breathing:**
  - Primarily due to reduced lung and chest wall compliance.
  - Less commonly due to increased airway resistance.
  - Controlled mechanical ventilation typically mitigates increased work of breathing.
## Effects on the Respiratory Pattern
- **Anesthesia and Breathing Patterns:**
  - Light anesthesia often results in irregular breathing patterns, with breath holding being common.
  - Breaths become regular with deeper anesthesia levels.
  - Inhalation agents generally produce rapid, shallow breaths.
  - Nitrous–opioid techniques result in slow, deep breaths.
## Effects of Anesthesia on Gas Exchange

- **Abnormalities in Gas Exchange**: Common during anesthesia, including increased dead space, hypoventilation, and increased intrapulmonary shunting.
- **Increased Dead Space**: Most commonly seen during controlled ventilation but may also occur during spontaneous ventilation.
- **Increased Venous Admixture**: General anesthesia typically increases venous admixture to 5% to 10%, likely due to atelectasis and airway collapse in dependent lung areas.
- **Inhibition of Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction**: Inhalation agents, vasodilators, and inodilators can inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction; for volatile agents, the ED50 is about twice the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC).
- **Age-Related Changes**: Older adults tend to have the largest increases in venous admixture. Inspired O2 tensions of 30% to 40% usually prevent hypoxemia, suggesting anesthesia increases relative shunt.
- **Use of PEEP**: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is often effective in reducing venous admixture and preventing hypoxemia during general anesthesia, as long as cardiac output is maintained.
- **High Inspired O2 Concentrations**: Prolonged administration may lead to atelectasis and increased absolute shunt, known as resorption atelectasis, occurring in areas with a low V/Q ratio ventilated at an O2-inspired concentration close to 100%. Perfusion results in O2 being transported out of the alveoli faster than it enters, causing alveoli to empty and collapse.
# Ventilation-Perfusion Relationships

## Ventilation
- **Minute Ventilation:**
  - Defined as the sum of all exhaled gas volumes in one minute.
  - Minute ventilation (\(\dot{V}\)) = Respiratory rate × Tidal volume (\(V_T\)).
  - For the average adult at rest, minute ventilation is about 5 L/min.
- **Dead Space:**
  - Not all inspired gas reaches the alveoli; some remains in the airways and is exhaled without gas exchange.
  - The part of the \(V_T\) not participating in alveolar gas exchange is known as dead space (V_D).
  - Alveolar ventilation (V_A) is the volume of inspired gases taking part in gas exchange in one minute.
  - VA = Respiratory rate x (V_T - V_D)
## Dead Space
- **Components:**
  - Composed of gases in non-respiratory airways (anatomic dead space) and alveoli that are not perfused (alveolar dead space).
  - The sum of anatomic and alveolar dead space is referred to as physiological dead space.
  - In the upright position, dead space is about 150 mL for most adults (approximately 2 mL/kg) and is nearly all anatomic.
- **Influencing Factors:**
  - Dead space can be affected by various factors.
### Factors Affecting Dead Space

| Factor                            | Effect |
| --------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Posture**                       |        |
| Upright                           | ↑      |
| Supine                            | ↓      |
| **Position of airway**            |        |
| Neck extension                    | ↑      |
| Neck flexion                      | ↓      |
| **Age**                           | ↑      |
| **Artificial airway**             | ↓      |
| **Positive-pressure ventilation** | ↑      |
| **Drugs—anticholinergic**         | ↑      |
| **Pulmonary perfusion**           |        |
| Pulmonary emboli                  | ↑      |
| Hypotension                       | ↑      |
| **Pulmonary vascular disease**    |        |
| Emphysema                         | ↑      |

- Because VT in the average adult is approximately 450 mL (6 mL/kg), VD/VT is normally 33%. This ratio can be derived by the Bohr equation:
VD/VT = (PACO2 - PECO2) / PACO2

- where PACO2 is the alveolar CO2 tension and PECO2 is the mixed expired CO2 tension. This equation is useful clinically if arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) is used the approximate the alveolar concentration and the CO2 tension in expired air gases is the average measured over several minutes.
## Distribution of Ventilation

- **General Distribution:**
  - Regardless of body position, alveolar ventilation is unevenly distributed in the lungs.
  - The right lung receives more ventilation than the left lung (53% vs. 47%).
- **Dependent vs. Non-dependent Areas:**
  - Lower (dependent) areas of both lungs tend to be better ventilated than the upper areas due to a gravitationally induced gradient in intrapleural pressure (transpulmonary pressure).
  - Pleural pressure decreases by approximately 1 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (becomes less negative) per 3-cm decrease in lung height.
  
- **Effect of Transpulmonary Pressure:**
  - Different areas of the lungs are placed at different points on the pulmonary compliance curve due to varying transpulmonary pressures.
  - Alveoli in the upper lung areas have higher transpulmonary pressure, are near-maximally inflated, and relatively noncompliant, undergoing little expansion during inspiration.
  - In contrast, smaller alveoli in dependent areas have lower transpulmonary pressure, are more compliant, and undergo greater expansion during inspiration.
## Distribution of Ventilation

- **Uneven Distribution:**
  - Alveolar ventilation is unevenly distributed in the lungs, regardless of body position.
  - The right lung receives more ventilation than the left lung (53% vs. 47%).
  - Lower (dependent) areas of both lungs are better ventilated than upper areas due to a gravitational gradient in intrapleural pressure (transpulmonary pressure).
  - Pleural pressure decreases by about 1 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (becomes less negative) per 3 cm decrease in lung height.
- **Alveolar Characteristics:**
  - Alveoli in upper lung areas are near-maximally inflated due to higher transpulmonary pressure and are relatively noncompliant, undergoing little expansion during inspiration.
  - Smaller alveoli in dependent areas have lower transpulmonary pressure, are more compliant, and undergo greater expansion during inspiration.
- **Airway Resistance:**
  - Airway resistance can also contribute to regional differences in pulmonary ventilation.
  - Final alveolar inspiratory volume depends on compliance only if inspiratory time is unlimited.
  - An excessively short inspiratory time prevents alveoli from reaching expected volume change.
  - Alveolar filling follows an exponential function dependent on both compliance and airway resistance.
## Time Constants

- **Definition:**
  - Lung inflation can be described by the time constant, τ:
	tau = Total compliance x Airway resistance
  - Regional variations in resistance or compliance can interfere with alveolar filling and cause asynchrony in alveolar filling during inspiration.
- **Effects of Rapid Breathing:**
  - Variations in time constants within the normal lung can be demonstrated in individuals breathing at abnormally high respiratory rates.
  - Rapid shallow breathing reverses the normal distribution of ventilation, favoring upper (nondependent) areas over lower areas
# Pulmonary Perfusion

- **General Overview:**
  - Of the approximately 5 L/min of blood flowing through the lungs, only about 70 to 100 mL at any one time are within the pulmonary capillaries undergoing gas exchange.
  - At the alveolar–capillary membrane, this small volume forms a 50 to 100 m² sheet of blood, approximately one red cell thick.
- **Capillary Perfusion:**
  - Each capillary perfuses more than one alveolus, ensuring optimal gas exchange.
  - Capillary volume remains relatively constant, but total pulmonary blood volume can vary between 500 mL and 1000 mL.
  - Large increases in cardiac output or blood volume are tolerated with little change in pressure due to passive dilation and some recruitment of collapsed pulmonary vessels.
  - Small increases in pulmonary blood volume occur during cardiac systole and with each normal (spontaneous) inspiration.
- **Posture and Pulmonary Blood Volume:**
  - A shift from supine to erect decreases pulmonary blood volume (up to 27%).
  - Trendelenburg positioning has the opposite effect.
  - Changes in systemic capacitance influence pulmonary blood volume.
  - Systemic venoconstriction shifts blood from the systemic to the pulmonary circulation, while vasodilation causes a pulmonary-to-systemic redistribution.
- **Pulmonary Vascular Tone:**
  - Local factors are more important than the autonomic system in influencing pulmonary vascular tone.
  - Hypoxia is a powerful stimulus for pulmonary vasoconstriction, the opposite of its systemic effect.
  - Both pulmonary arterial (mixed venous) and alveolar hypoxia induce vasoconstriction, with the latter being more powerful.
  - Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction reduces intrapulmonary shunting and prevents hypoxemia.
  - Hyperoxia has little effect on pulmonary circulation in normal individuals.
  - Hypercapnia and acidosis have a constrictor effect, while hypocapnia causes pulmonary vasodilation, the opposite of what occurs in the systemic circulation.
## Distribution of Pulmonary Perfusion (West Zones)

- **General Distribution:**
  - Pulmonary blood flow is not uniform.
  - Dependent areas of the lung receive greater blood flow than nondependent areas due to gravitational gradients.
  - Low pressures in the pulmonary circulation allow gravity to significantly influence blood flow.
  - Perfusion scanning shows an "onion-like" layering distribution, with reduced flow at the periphery and increased perfusion toward the hilum.
  - Alveolar distending pressure is relatively constant across the lung, while pulmonary perfusion pressure varies.
- **West Zones of the Lung:**
  - **Zone 1 (P<sub>A</sub> > P<sub>a</sub> > P<sub>V</sub>):**
	- Alveolar pressure (P<sub>A</sub>) exceeds both arterial pulmonary pressure (P<sub>a</sub>) and venous pulmonary pressure (P<sub>V</sub>), resulting in obstruction of blood flow and creation of alveolar dead space.
	- Zone 1 is small in spontaneously breathing individuals but can enlarge during positive pressure ventilation.
  - **Zone 2 (P<sub>a</sub> > P<sub>A</sub> > P<sub>V</sub>):**
	- Arterial pulmonary pressure (P<sub>a</sub>) exceeds alveolar pressure (P<sub>A</sub>), but venous pulmonary pressure (P<sub>V</sub>) is less than both, resulting in blood flow dependent on the differential between P<sub>a</sub> and P<sub>A</sub>.
  - **Zone 3 (P<sub>a</sub> > P<sub>V</sub> > P<sub>A</sub>):**
	- Both arterial and venous pulmonary pressures (P<sub>a</sub> and P<sub>V</sub>) exceed alveolar pressure (P<sub>A</sub>), resulting in blood flow independent of alveolar pressure.
  - **Zone 4:**
	- The most dependent part of the lung, where atelectasis and interstitial pulmonary edema occur, resulting in blood flow dependent on the differential between arterial pulmonary pressure (P<sub>a</sub>) and pulmonary interstitial pressure.
## Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio

- **Normal Values:**
  - Alveolar ventilation (\(\dot{V}_A\)) is normally about 4 L/min.
  - Pulmonary capillary perfusion (\(\dot{Q}\)) is about 5 L/min.
  - The overall ventilation-perfusion ratio (\(\dot{V}/\dot{Q}\)) is approximately 0.8.
- **Range of Ratios:**
  - For individual lung units (each alveolus and its capillary), the ratio can range from 0 (no ventilation) to infinity (no perfusion).
	- A ratio of 0 refers to an intrapulmonary shunt.
	- A ratio of infinity constitutes alveolar dead space.
  - Normally, V/Q ranges between 0.3 and 3.0, with the majority of lung areas close to 1.0.
- **Distribution:**
  - Because perfusion increases at a greater rate than ventilation, nondependent (apical) areas tend to have higher ratios than dependent (basal) areas.
- **Physiological Importance:**
  - The V/Q ratio is crucial for the efficiency with which lung units resaturate venous blood with O2 and eliminate CO2
  - Pulmonary venous blood (the effluent) from areas with low \(\dot{V}/\dot{Q}\) ratios has low O2 tension and high CO2 tension—similar to systemic mixed venous blood.
  - Blood from these units tends to depress arterial O2 tension and elevate arterial CO2
	- The effect on arterial O2 tension is much more profound than on CO2 tension.
	- Arterial CO2 tension often decreases due to a hypoxemia-induced reflex increase in alveolar ventilation.
- **Compensatory Mechanisms:**
  - An appreciable compensatory increase in O2 uptake cannot take place in remaining areas where V/Q is normal because pulmonary end-capillary blood is usually already maximally saturated with O2
- **COVID-19 Implications:**
  - COVID-19 is associated with increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch, resulting in reduced oxygenation.
	- Alveolar and interstitial damage contribute to impaired ventilation of alveoli.
	- Prothrombotic effects of COVID-19 contribute to the development of pulmonary emboli, reducing lung perfusion and increasing dead space ventilation.
## Shunts

- **Definition:**
  - Shunting refers to the process where desaturated, mixed venous blood from the right heart returns to the left heart without being oxygenated in the lungs.
  - The overall effect of shunting is to decrease (dilute) arterial O2
- **Types of Shunts:**
  - **Right-to-Left Shunt:**
	- This type of shunt decreases arterial O2 content and leads to hypoxemia.
  - **Left-to-Right Shunt:**
	- This type of shunt, in the absence of pulmonary congestion, does not produce hypoxemia.
### Intrapulmonary Shunts

Intrapulmonary shunts are often classified as absolute or relative:

- **Absolute Shunt**: Refers to anatomic shunts and lung units where the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio is zero. In this case, blood passes through the lung without being oxygenated.
- **Relative Shunt**: An area of the lung with a low V/Q ratio. Some oxygenation occurs, but it is less efficient than normal.
Clinically, hypoxemia resulting from a relative shunt can usually be partially corrected by increasing the inspired O2 concentration. However, hypoxemia caused by an absolute shunt cannot be corrected by increasing the inspired O2 concentration.
## Venous Admixture

- **Venous Admixture**: The amount of mixed venous blood that would have to be mixed with pulmonary end-capillary blood to account for the difference in O2 tension between arterial and pulmonary end-capillary blood.
- Pulmonary end-capillary blood is considered to have the same concentrations as alveolar gas.
- Venous admixture is usually expressed as a fraction of total cardiac output (Q̇).
- The equation for venous admixture (Q_s/Q_t) can be derived using the law for the conservation of mass for O2 across the pulmonary bed:

Qs/QT = (Cc'O2 - CaO2) / (Cc'O2 - CvO2)

Qs = blood flow through the physiologic shunt compartment

QT = total cardiac output

Qc' = blood flow across normally ventilated pulmonary capillaries

QT = Qc' + Qs

Cc'O2 = oxygen content of ideal pulmonary end-capillary blood

CaO2 = arterial oxygen content

CvO2 = mixed venous oxygen content

- Venous admixture can be calculated clinically by obtaining mixed venous and arterial blood gas measurements; the former requires a pulmonary artery catheter.
- The alveolar gas equation is used to derive pulmonary end-capillary O2 tension:

PAO2=FIO2×(PB−PH2O)−(PaCO2/R)

- PAO2 = alveolar oxygen tension
- FIO2 = fraction of inspired oxygen
- PB = barometric pressure
- PH2O = water vapor pressure (usually 47 mmHg at body temperature)
- PaCO2 = arterial carbon dioxide tension
- R = respiratory quotient (usually 0.8)
- Pulmonary capillary blood is usually assumed to be 100% saturated for an FIO2 of 0.21 or greater.
- The calculated venous admixture assumes that all shunting is intrapulmonary and due to absolute shunts. In reality, neither is ever the case; nonetheless, the concept is useful clinically.
- Normal venous admixture is primarily due to communication between deep bronchial veins and pulmonary veins, the thebesian circulation in the heart, and areas of low V/Q ratios in the lungs.
- The venous admixture in normal individuals (physiological shunt) is typically less than 5% of the cardiac output.

### Summary
- **Absolute Shunt**: No ventilation, V/Q = 0. Hypoxemia not corrected by increasing FIO2.
- **Relative Shunt**: Low V/Q ratio. Hypoxemia partially corrected by increasing FIO2.
- **Venous Admixture**: The amount of mixed venous blood needed to explain the arterial O2 tension. Calculated using mixed venous and arterial blood gases and the alveolar gas equation. Assumes 100% saturation of pulmonary capillary blood and intrapulmonary shunting. Normal physiological shunt is less than 5%.
# Alveolar, Arterial, and Venous Gas Tension
- **Gas Mixtures and Partial Pressure**: Each gas in a mixture contributes separately to total gas pressure, with its partial pressure proportional to its concentration. Air, with 21% O2, at a barometric pressure of 760 mm Hg, has an O2 partial pressure (PO2) of 159.6 mm Hg: 760 mm Hg × 0.21 = 159.6 mm Hg.
- **General Equation for Partial Pressure**:
\[PIO2 = PB × FiO2 \]
  - PB = barometric pressure
  - FiO2 = fraction of inspired O2
## Oxygen Alveolar Oxygen Tension

- **Humidification and Water Vapor**: Inspired gas is humidified at 37°C, reducing PIO2 by the water vapor pressure of 47 mm Hg at this temperature. The normal PO2 at sea level in humidified air is 150 mm Hg:
\[(760–47) × 0.21 = 150 mm Hg \]
- **General Equation for Alveolar O2 Tension**:
\[PIO2 = (PB–PH2O) × FiO2 \]
  - PH2O = vapor pressure of water at body temperature
- **Estimation of Alveolar O2 Tension (PAO2)**:
\[PAO2 = FIO2 × (PB - PH2O) - (PaCO2 / RQ) \]
  - PaCO2 = arterial CO2 tension
  - RQ = respiratory quotient, usually not measured
- **Hypoxia and PaCO2**: Large increases in PaCO2 (>75 mm Hg) can cause hypoxia (PaO2 <60 mm Hg) at room air but not at high inspired O2 concentrations.
## Pulmonary End-Capillary Oxygen Tension

- **PAO2 and Pc'O2 Gradient**: For practical purposes, pulmonary end-capillary O2 tension (Pc'O2) is considered identical to PAO2; the gradient is normally minute.
- **Factors Affecting Pc'O2**: Rate of O2 diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane, pulmonary capillary blood volume, and transit time. The large surface area and thin membrane facilitate O2 diffusion. Enhanced O2 binding to hemoglobin at saturations above 80% augments O2 diffusion.
- **Capillary Transit Time**: Estimated by dividing pulmonary capillary blood volume by cardiac output; normal transit time is 70 mL ÷ 5000 mL/min (0.8 s). Maximum Pc'O2 is usually attained after 0.3 s, providing a large safety margin.
- **O2 Transfer and Binding**: O2 binding to hemoglobin is the principal rate-limiting factor in O2 transfer. Pulmonary diffusing capacity reflects alveolar-capillary membrane capacity, permeability, and pulmonary blood flow. O2 uptake is normally limited by pulmonary blood flow, not O2 diffusion, which may become significant during exercise at high altitudes and in patients with extensive membrane destruction.
- **O2 Diffusing Capacity (DLO2)**: Pc'O2 cannot be accurately measured; carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) is used to assess gas transfer, as carbon monoxide has a high affinity for hemoglobin, making Pc'CO effectively zero.
- **Reductions in DLCO**: Imply impediments in gas transfer, due to abnormal V/Q ratios, extensive membrane destruction, or short capillary transit times. Abnormalities are accentuated by increased O2 consumption and cardiac output during exercise.
## Arterial Oxygen Tension
- **Measurement of PaO2**: Must be measured at room air, not calculated like PAO2. The alveolar-to-arterial O2 partial pressure gradient (A–a gradient) is normally less than 15 mm Hg but increases with age up to 20 to 30 mm Hg. Arterial O2 tension can be approximated by the following formula (in mm Hg):
\[PaO2 = PIO2 - (PaCO2 / RQ) \]
- **Age-Related Changes**: Decreases in PaO2 are likely due to a progressive increase in closing capacity relative to functional residual capacity (FRC).
## Hypoxemia

[Calgary- Hypoxemia](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Hypoxemia--Pathogenesis-and-clinical-findings/)

### Mechanisms

- **Low Alveolar Oxygen Tension**
	- Low inspired oxygen tension
	- Low fractional inspired concentration
	- High altitude
	- Alveolar hypoventilation
	- Diffusion hypoxia
	- Increased oxygen consumption
- **Increased Alveolar-Arterial Gradient**
	- Right-to-left shunting
	- Increased areas of low \(V/Q \) ratios

**Low Mixed Venous Oxygen Tension**
**Decreased Cardiac Output**
 **Increased Oxygen Consumption**
**Decreased Hemoglobin Concentration**
#### Key Points on Hypoxemia Mechanisms

1. **Increased Alveolar-Arterial (A–a) Gradient**:
   - **Common Mechanism**: The most common mechanism for hypoxemia is an increased A–a gradient.
   - **Dependence Factors**: The A–a gradient for O2 depends on right-to-left shunting, the amount of scatter, and mixed venous O2 tension.
   - **Shunt Relationship**: The A–a gradient for O2 is directly proportional to shunt but inversely proportional to mixed venous O\(_2\) tension.
   - **FiO2 and Shunt**: Greater shunts decrease the likelihood that an increase in FiO2 will correct hypoxemia. Iso-shunt lines are most useful for O2 concentrations between 35% and 100%. Lower O concentrations require modifications to account for scatter effects.

2. **Cardiac Output and A–a Gradient**:
   - **Impact on Mixed Venous O2**: Cardiac output affects the A–a gradient through its impact on mixed venous O2 tension and a direct relationship with intrapulmonary shunting.
   - **Low Cardiac Output**: Low cardiac output accentuates the effect of shunt on PaO2.
   - **Pulmonary Vasoconstriction**: A reduction in venous admixture may occur with low-normal cardiac outputs due to increased pulmonary vasoconstriction from lower mixed venous O2 tension.
   - **High Cardiac Output**: High cardiac outputs can increase venous admixture by raising mixed venous O2 tension, inhibiting hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.

3. **O2 Consumption and Hemoglobin Concentration**:
   - **Secondary Effects**: O2 consumption and hemoglobin concentration affect PaO2 through their impact on mixed venous O2 tension.
   - **High O2 Consumption and Low Hemoglobin**: High O2 consumption rates and low hemoglobin concentrations can increase the A–a gradient and decrease PaO2
## Mixed Venous Oxygen Tension

- Normal mixed venous O2 tension is about 40 mm Hg and represents the overall balance between O2 consumption and O2 delivery
- A true mixed venous blood sample contains venous drainage from the superior vena cava, the inferior vena cava, and the heart; it must therefore be obtained from a pulmonary artery catheter.

## Carbon Dioxide

- **Production**: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced by aerobic metabolism in mitochondria.
- **Gradients**: There are gradients for CO2 tension from mitochondria to cell cytoplasm, extracellular fluid, venous blood, and alveoli, where CO2 is finally eliminated.
### Mixed Venous Carbon Dioxide Tension
- **Normal Values**: Normal mixed venous CO2 tension is about 46 mm Hg.
- **End Result**: This value is the result of the mixing of blood from tissues with varying metabolic activities.
  - **Low Metabolic Activity**: Venous CO2 tension is lower in tissues with low metabolic activity (e.g., skin).
  - **High Metabolic Activity**: Venous CO2tension is higher in blood from tissues with relatively high activity (e.g., heart).
### Alveolar Carbon Dioxide Tension
- **PACO2**: Alveolar CO2 tension (PACO2generally represents the balance between total CO2 production and alveolar ventilation (elimination).
- PAC02 = VC02/ VA
![[image-835-x245-y34.png]]
- where A is alveolar ventilation.
- During periods of acute hypoventilation or hypoperfusion, body content of carbon dioxide increases.
- Clinically, PACO2 is more dependent on variations in alveolar ventilation than in CO2 production, because
- CO2 production does not vary appreciably under most circumstances. However, conditions such as malignant hyperthermia can lead to dramatic increases in CO2 production, which can overwhelm the body’s buffering system
### Pulmonary End-Capillary Carbon Dioxide Tension
- Pulmonary end-capillary CO2 tension (Pc′CO2) is virtually identical to PACO2 for the same reasons as those discussed in the section about O2.
- In addition, the diffusion rate for CO2 across the alveolar–capillary membrane is 20 times that of O2.
- Arterial Carbon Dioxide Tension Arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2), which is readily measurable, is identical to Pc′CO2, and, necessarily, PACO2. Normal PaCO2 is 38 ± 4 mm Hg (5.1 ± 0.5 kPa); in practice, 40 mm Hg is usually considered normal. Although low ratios tend to increase PaCO2, whereas high ratios tend to decrease it, significant arterial-to-alveolar gradients for CO2 develop only in the presence of marked abnormalities (>30% venous admixture); even then, the gradient is relatively small (2–3 mm Hg).
- Moreover, small increases in the gradient appreciably increase CO2 output into alveoli with relatively normal. Even moderate to severe disturbances usually fail to appreciably alter arterial CO2 because of a reflex increase in ventilation from concomitant hypoxemia.
- End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide Tension Because end-tidal gas is primarily alveolar gas and PACO2 is virtually identical to PaCO2, end-tidal CO2 tension (PETCO2) is used clinically as an estimate of PaCO2. T
- The PACO2–PETCO2 gradient is normally less than 5 mm Hg and represents the dilution of alveolar gas with CO2-free gas from nonperfused alveoli (alveolar dead space).
# Transport of Respiratory Gasses in Blood
- Oxygen O2 is carried in blood in two forms: dissolved in solution and in reversible association with hemoglobin. Dissolved Oxygen The amount of O2 dissolved in blood can be derived from Henry’s law, which states that the concentration of any gas in solution is proportional to its partial pressure.
- The mathematical expression is as follows:
	- Gas concentration = α × Partial pressure where α = the gas solubility coefficient for a given solution at a given temperature.
		- The solubility coefficient for O2 at normal body temperature is 0.003 mL/dL/mm Hg. Even with a PaO2 of 100 mm Hg, the maximum amount of O 2 dissolved in blood is very small (0.3 mL/dL) compared with that bound to hemoglobin.
## Hemoglobin
- Hemoglobin is a complex molecule consisting of four heme and four protein subunit
	- Heme is an iron–porphyrin compound that is an essential part of the 2 O-binding sites; only the divalent form (+2 charge) of iron can bind O2.
	- The normal hemoglobin molecule (hemoglobin A1) consists of two α and two β chains (subunits); the four subunits are held together by weak bonds between the amino acid residues.Each gram of hemoglobin can theoretically carry up to 1.39 mL of 2 O.
### Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve
- Each hemoglobin molecule binds up to four O2 molecules.
- The complex interaction between the hemoglobin subunits results in nonlinear (an elongated S shape) binding with O2.
- Hemoglobin saturation is the amount of O2 bound as a percentage of its total O2-binding capacity. Four separate chemical reactions are involved in binding each of the four O2 molecules.
- The change in molecular conformation induced by the binding of the first three molecules greatly accelerates binding of the fourth O2 molecule.
- The last reaction is responsible for the accelerated binding between 25% and 100% saturation.
- At about 90% saturation, the decrease in available O2 receptors flattens the curve until full saturation is reached.
#### Factors Influencing the HB Diss Curve

The hemoglobin (Hb) dissociation curve illustrates the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen (O2) and hemoglobin saturation. Several clinically important factors can influence this curve, shifting it either to the right or left, thereby altering O2 binding affinity. The curve’s position can be quantitatively described by the P50 value, which is the partial pressure of O2 at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated. The normal P50 in adults is 26.6 mm Hg.

1. **Hydrogen Ion Concentration (pH)**
	- **Bohr Effect**: An increase in hydrogen ion concentration (decrease in pH) shifts the dissociation curve to the right, reducing O2 binding to hemoglobin. This is known as the Bohr effect.
	- **Impact on Blood**: This effect is more significant in venous blood due to its lower pH compared to arterial blood. It facilitates O2 release to tissues while minimally impairing O2 uptake unless severe hypoxia is present.
2. **CO2 Tension (Partial Pressure of CO2)**
	- **Mechanism**: Elevated CO2 levels increase hydrogen ion concentration, thus reducing hemoglobin's affinity for O2. This is critical in venous capillary blood where high CO2 levels facilitate O2 release to tissues.
	- **Pulmonary Capillaries**: In the lungs, lower CO2 levels increase hemoglobin's affinity for O2, aiding in O2 uptake from alveoli.
3. **Temperature**
	- Higher temperatures shift the curve to the right, decreasing O2 affinity and enhancing O2 release to tissues.
	- Lower temperatures shift the curve to the left, increasing O2 affinity and reducing O2 availability to tissues.
4. **2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG)**
	- **Role**: 2,3-DPG is a byproduct of glycolysis that accumulates during anaerobic metabolism. It binds to deoxygenated hemoglobin, stabilizing it and promoting O2 release.
	- **Clinical Relevance**: While its effects are generally minor under normal conditions, 2,3-DPG levels can play a compensatory role in chronic anemia and impact the O2-carrying capacity of blood transfusions.
#### Abnormal Ligands

1. **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**
	- **Affinity for Hemoglobin**: CO has 200 to 300 times the affinity for hemoglobin compared to oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin.
	- **Impact**: CO binding decreases hemoglobin’s oxygen-carrying capacity and impairs the release of oxygen to tissues, leading to hypoxia.
2. **Cyanide (CN−), Sulfur Monoxide (SO), and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)**
	- **Binding Sites**: These ligands can bind to the oxygen-binding sites on hemoglobin, similarly reducing its ability to carry and release oxygen.
3. **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**
	- **Binding Mechanism**: CO2 binds to a different site on the heme molecule, not the oxygen-binding site. This binding allosterically favors the unloading of oxygen, thereby facilitating oxygen release to tissues.
4. **Nitric Oxide (NO)**
	- **Complex Interaction**: The interaction of NO with hemoglobin is complex. It is hypothesized that hemoglobin may transport and deliver NO to regulate oxygen delivery to tissues.
#### Abnormal Forms of Hemoglobin

1. **Methemoglobin**
	- **Formation**: Occurs when the iron in the heme group is oxidized from the ferrous (+2) to the ferric (+3) state.
	- **Causes**: Can be caused by exposure to nitrates, nitrites, sulfonamides, and certain other drugs.
	- **Impact**: Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen, and it shifts the hemoglobin saturation curve to the left, impairing oxygen release. This condition decreases the overall oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
	- **Treatment**: Reduction of methemoglobin back to normal hemoglobin can be facilitated by agents such as methylene blue or ascorbic acid.
2. **Abnormal Hemoglobins**
	- **Variants**: Variations in the protein subunit composition of hemoglobin can result in different forms, each with unique oxygen-saturation characteristics.
		- **Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF)**: Has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, facilitating oxygen transfer from the mother to the fetus.
		- **Hemoglobin A2 (HbA2)**: A minor component of adult hemoglobin, typically accounting for about 2-3% of total hemoglobin.
		- **Sickle Hemoglobin (HbS)**: Found in individuals with sickle cell disease, it causes red blood cells to deform under low oxygen conditions, leading to various complications and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues.
## Oxygen Content
- The total oxygen (O2) content of blood is the sum of that dissolved in plasma plus that carried by hemoglobin. In reality, O2 binding to hemoglobin never achieves the theoretical maximum, but it is close to 1.31 mL O2/dL blood per millimeter of mercury. Total O2 content is expressed by the following equation:
O2 content = (0.003 x PO2) + (SO2 x Hb x 1.31 mL/dL blood)
- PO2: Partial pressure of oxygen
- SO2: Oxygen saturation
- Hb: Hemoglobin concentration
where Hb is hemoglobin concentration in g/dL blood, and SO2 is hemoglobin saturation at the given PO2. Using this formula and a hemoglobin of 15 g/dL, the normal O2 content for both arterial and mixed venous blood and the arteriovenous difference can be calculated as follows:

### Oxygen Transport
- O2 transport is dependent on both respiratory and circulatory function. Total O2 delivery to tissues is the product of arterial O2 content and cardiac output:
	- CaO2 = (0.003 * 100) + (0.975 * 15 * 1.31) = 19.5 mL/dL blood
	- CvO2 = (0.003 * 40) + (0.75 * 15 * 1.31) = 14.8 mL/dL blood
	- CaO2 - CvO2 = 4.7 mL/dL blood
- Note that arterial O2 content is dependent on PaO2 as well as hemoglobin concentration. As a result, deficiencies in O2 delivery may be due to a low PaO2, a low hemoglobin concentration, or an inadequate cardiac output. Normal O2 delivery can be calculated as follows:
	- DO2 = CaO2 * QT
- The Fick equation expresses the relationship between O2 consumption, O2 content, and cardiac output:
	- O2 delivery = 20 mL O2/dL blood * 50 dL blood/min = 1000 mL O2/min
	- O2 consumption = VO2 = QT * (CaO2 - CvO2)
- Rearranging the equation:
	- CaO2 = VO2/QT + CvO2
- Consequently, the arteriovenous difference is a good measure of the overall adequacy of O2 delivery. As calculated above, the arteriovenous difference is about 5 mL O2/dL blood (20 mL O2/dL–15 mL O2/dL). Note that the normal extraction fraction is 5 mL ÷ 20 mL, or 25%; thus, the body normally consumes only 25% of the O2 carried on hemoglobin.
- When O2 demand exceeds supply, the extraction fraction exceeds 25%. Conversely, if O2 supply exceeds demand, the extraction fraction falls below 25%. When O2 delivery is even moderately reduced, VO2 usually remains normal because of increased O2 extraction (mixed venous O2 saturation decreases); VO2 remains independent of delivery. With further reductions in DO2, however, a critical point is reached beyond which VO2 becomes directly proportional to DO2. This state of supply-dependent O2 is typically associated with progressive lactic acidosis caused by cellular hypoxia.
### Oxygen Stores

- The concept of O2 stores is important in anesthesia. When the normal flux of O2 is interrupted by apnea, existing O2 stores are consumed by cellular metabolism; if stores are depleted, hypoxia and eventual cell death follow.
- Theoretically, adults normally store about 1500 mL of O2. This includes the O2 remaining in the lungs, that bound to hemoglobin (and myoglobin), and that dissolved in body fluids. Unfortunately, the high affinity of hemoglobin for O2 (the affinity of myoglobin is even higher), and the very limited quantity of O2 in solution, restrict the availability of these stores.
- The O2 contained within the lungs at functional residual capacity (FRC), therefore, becomes the most important source of O2. Apnea in a patient previously breathing room air leaves approximately 480 mL of O2 in the lungs (if FiO2 = 0.21 and FRC = 2300 mL, O2 content = FiO2 × FRC). The metabolic activity of tissues rapidly depletes this reservoir (presumably at a rate equivalent to VO2); severe hypoxemia usually occurs within 90 seconds. The onset of hypoxemia can be delayed by increasing the FiO2 prior to the apnea.
- Following ventilation with 100% O2, FRC contains about 2300 mL of O2; this delays hypoxemia following apnea for 4 to 5 minutes. This concept is the basis for preoxygenation (denitrogenation) prior to induction of anesthesia.
## Carbon Dioxide

Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is transported in the blood in three forms: dissolved in solution, as bicarbonate, and with proteins as carbamino compounds. The sum of all three forms constitutes the total CO₂ content of blood, which is routinely reported with electrolyte measurements.

- **Reaction:**
	- H2O + CO2 ↔ H2CO3 ↔ H+ + HCO3-

### Plasma CO₂ Reaction and Role of Carbonic Anhydrase
- Less than 1% of dissolved CO₂ in plasma undergoes the above reaction. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase, present in erythrocytes and endothelium, significantly accelerates this reaction. Consequently, bicarbonate forms the largest fraction of CO₂ in blood.
- **Effect of Acetazolamide:** Administration of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, can impair CO₂ transport between tissues and alveoli.
- **Chloride (Hamburger) Shift:** On the venous side of systemic capillaries, CO₂ enters red blood cells and converts to bicarbonate, which diffuses into plasma; chloride ions move into red cells to maintain electrical balance. In pulmonary capillaries, the reverse occurs: chloride ions exit red cells as bicarbonate re-enters, converting back to CO₂ and diffusing into alveoli.
### Carbamino Compounds
- CO₂ reacts with amino groups on proteins:
	- R-NH2 + CO2 → RNH-CO2- + H+
- At physiological pH, a small amount of CO₂ is carried in this form, mainly as carbaminohaemoglobin. Deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyhemoglobin) has a 3.5 times greater affinity for CO₂ than oxyhemoglobin, resulting in venous blood carrying more CO₂ than arterial blood (Haldane effect).
- PCO₂ normally has little effect on the fraction of CO₂ carried as carbaminohaemoglobin.

### Effects of Hemoglobin Buffering on Carbon Dioxide Transport
- **Hemoglobin as a Buffer:** Hemoglobin can act as a buffer at physiological pH due to its high histidine content. Its acid-base behavior is influenced by its oxygenation state.
- **Oxygenation and CO₂ Transport:**
	- In tissue capillaries, removal of O₂ from hemoglobin causes it to behave more like a base, taking up hydrogen ions and shifting the CO₂–bicarbonate equilibrium toward greater bicarbonate formation:
		- H+ + HbO2 → HbH+ + O2
	- Deoxyhemoglobin increases the amount of CO₂ carried:
		- CO2 + H2O + HbO2 → HbH+ + HCO3- + O2
	- In venous blood, CO₂ is primarily transported as bicarbonate. As CO₂ is taken up from tissues and converted to bicarbonate, the total CO₂ content of blood increases. The reverse process occurs in the lungs, where oxygenation of hemoglobin favors its action as an acid, releasing hydrogen ions and shifting the equilibrium toward greater CO₂ formation:
		- O2 + HCO3- + HbH+ → H2O + CO2 + HbO2

#### Carbon Dioxide Content of Plasma (mmol/L)

| **Component**     | **Arterial** | **Venous** |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Dissolved CO₂** | 1.2          | 1.4        |
| **Bicarbonate**   | 24.4         | 26.2       |
| **Carbamino CO₂** | Negligible   | Negligible |
| **Total CO₂**     | 25.6         | 27.6       |

### Carbon Dioxide Dissociation Curve

A CO₂ dissociation curve can be constructed by plotting the total CO₂ content of blood against PCO₂. The contribution of each form of CO₂ can also be quantified in this manner.

### Carbon Dioxide Stores
- **Storage Capacity:** The body has large CO₂ stores, approximately 120 L in adults, primarily in the form of dissolved CO₂ and bicarbonate.
- **Equilibrium:** Establishing a new CO₂ equilibrium requires 20 to 30 minutes in case of imbalance between production and elimination, compared to less than 4 to 5 minutes for O₂.
- **Compartments:** CO₂ is stored in rapid-, intermediate-, and slow-equilibrating compartments. Due to the larger capacity of the intermediate and slow compartments, the rate of rise in arterial CO₂ tension is generally slower than its fall following acute changes in ventilation.
# Control of Breathing

Spontaneous ventilation results from rhythmic neural activity in respiratory centers within the brainstem. This activity regulates respiratory muscles to maintain normal O₂ and CO₂ tensions in the body. Basic neuronal activity is modified by inputs from other brain areas, both volitional and autonomic, as well as various central and peripheral sensors.

## Central Respiratory Centers

The basic breathing rhythm originates in the medulla:

- **Medullary Groups:**
	- **Dorsal Respiratory Group:** Primarily active during inspiration.
	- **Ventral Respiratory Group:** Active during both inspiration and expiration.
- **Pontine Areas:**
	- **Lower Pontine (Apneustic) Center:** Excitatory.
	- **Upper Pontine (Pneumotaxic) Center:** Inhibitory.
	- The pontine centers fine-tune respiratory rate and rhythm.
## Central Sensors

Central chemoreceptors, located on the anterolateral surface of the medulla, respond to changes in hydrogen ion concentration (H⁺) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF):

- **Mechanism:**
	- The blood-brain barrier is permeable to dissolved CO₂ but not to bicarbonate ions.
	- Acute changes in PaCO₂, but not in arterial bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻), are reflected in CSF.
	- Increases in PaCO₂ elevate CSF hydrogen ion concentration, activating chemoreceptors and stimulating adjacent respiratory medullary centers to increase alveolar ventilation, reducing PaCO₂ back to normal.
	- Conversely, decreases in CSF hydrogen ion concentration reduce alveolar ventilation, increasing PaCO₂.
	- The relationship between PaCO₂ and minute volume is nearly linear.
	- Very high arterial PaCO₂ tensions depress the ventilatory response (CO₂ narcosis).
	- The PaCO₂ at which ventilation is zero is known as the apneic threshold.
	- Spontaneous respirations are typically absent under anesthesia when PaCO₂ falls below the apneic threshold. In the awake state, cortical influences prevent apnea.
	- Central chemoreceptor activity is depressed by hypoxia, unlike peripheral chemoreceptors.
## Peripheral Sensors

Peripheral chemoreceptors include the carotid bodies (at the bifurcation of the common carotid arteries) and the aortic bodies (surrounding the aortic arch):

- **Carotid Bodies:**
	- Principal peripheral chemoreceptors in humans.
	- Sensitive to changes in PaO₂, PaCO₂, pH, and arterial perfusion pressure.
	- Interact with central respiratory centers via the glossopharyngeal nerves, increasing alveolar ventilation in response to reductions in PaO₂, arterial perfusion, or elevations in hydrogen ions and PaCO₂.
	- Stimulated by cyanide, doxapram, and large doses of nicotine.
	- Most sensitive to PaO₂; receptor activity increases appreciably when PaO₂ decreases below 50 mm Hg.
	- Glomus cells (carotid body cells) are primarily dopaminergic neurons.
	- Antidopaminergic drugs, most general anesthetics, and bilateral carotid surgery abolish the peripheral ventilatory response to hypoxemia.
### Lung Receptors

Impulses from lung receptors are carried centrally by the vagus nerve:

- **Stretch Receptors:**
	- Located in the smooth muscle of airways.
	- Inhibit inspiration when the lung is inflated to excessive volumes (Hering–Breuer inflation reflex).
	- Shorten exhalation when the lung is deflated (deflation reflex).
	- Normally play a minor role in humans; bilateral vagal nerve blocks minimally affect normal respiratory patterns.
- **Irritant Receptors:**
	- Located in the tracheobronchial mucosa.
	- React to noxious gases, smoke, dust, and cold gases, increasing respiratory rate, bronchoconstriction, and coughing.
- **Juxtacapillary (J) Receptors:**
	- Located in the interstitial space within alveolar walls.
	- Induce dyspnea in response to expansion of interstitial space volume and various chemical mediators following tissue damage.
### Other Receptors

These include various muscle and joint receptors on pulmonary muscles and the chest wall, which are likely important during exercise and in pathological conditions associated with decreased lung or chest compliance.

## Effects of Anesthesia on the Control of Breathing
- General anesthetics tend to promote hypoventilation by central depression of chemoreceptors and external intercostal muscle activity.
- The magnitude of hypoventilation is proportional to anesthetic depth.
- With increasing anesthesia depth, the slope of the PaCO₂/minute ventilation curve decreases, and the apneic threshold increases.
- Surgical stimulation partially reverses this effect.
- The peripheral response to hypoxemia is more sensitive to anesthetics than the central CO₂ response and is nearly abolished by even subanesthetic doses of most inhalation agents (including nitrous oxide) and many intravenous agents.
### Summary of Anesthesia Effects on the Respiratory System
- **Reduced Muscle Tone:**
	1. Reduced thoracic diameter and airway dimensions, increasing work of breathing and reducing tidal volume (exacerbated by ETT resistance).
	2. Reduced lung volumes and functional residual capacity (FRC). Closing capacity may exceed FRC, causing airway closure (atelectasis) and ventilation-perfusion mismatch, managed with PEEP.
- **Blunted Response to Hypoxia and Hypercarbia.**
- **Biological Effects:**
	- Reduced alveolar macrophage activity.
	- Reduced surfactant production.
	- Sensitivity of the pulmonary vasculature.
	- Cuff preventing usual flow of tracheal mucus.
	- Reduced humidity leading to viscous secretions.
# Non-Respiratory Lung Functions
- **Filtration:**
	- Pulmonary capillaries act as a filter for bloodstream debris due to their in-series position within the circulation.
	- The high content of heparin and plasminogen activator in the lungs facilitates the breakdown of entrapped fibrin debris.
	- Although pulmonary capillaries have an average diameter of 7 μm, larger particles, including fat macroglobules, can pass through to the left heart.
- **Reservoir Function:**
	- Pulmonary circulation acts as a reservoir for systemic circulation.
- **Metabolism:**
	- The lungs are metabolically active, involved in surfactant synthesis and extrahepatic mixed-function oxidation.
	- Neutrophils and macrophages produce O₂-derived free radicals in response to infection.
	- Pulmonary endothelium metabolizes various vasoactive compounds (norepinephrine, serotonin, bradykinin, and prostaglandins).
	- Histamine and epinephrine are generally not metabolized in the lungs; the lungs can be a major site of histamine synthesis and release during allergic reactions.
	- The lungs convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II via angiotensin-converting enzyme, located on the pulmonary endothelium.
