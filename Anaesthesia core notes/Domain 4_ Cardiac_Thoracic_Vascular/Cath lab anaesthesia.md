## Challenges and Risks
1. Unfamiliar environment (equipment, drugs)
2. Support staff unfamiliarity
3. Radiation exposure
4. Risks of fluoroscopy / contrast dyes (e.g., Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN))
5. Distance from recovery unit
6. Abnormal positioning
7. Limited patient access during procedures
8. Risk of disconnection due to radiographic equipment
9. Wide range of patient profiles (ages, comorbidities)
10. Unstable haemodynamic states (lesions, acute physiological effects of procedures)

## Radiation Hazards
- **Occupational Exposure Limits:** According to the EU International Commission on Radiological Protection, personnel exposed to ionising radiation should limit exposure to 20 mS per year, averaged over five years, with an annual maximum of 50 mS. A lifetime limit of 10 mS x age (years) is recommended. Normal background radiation is approximately 0.5 mS per year.
- **Exposure Data:** Mean exposure to radiation doubled but remained well under the annualised recommended dose limits. In studies of cath labs, the average exposure to radiation was 2–4 mS per year.

### Minimizing Exposure
- **Protection Measures:** Operators should wear shielding gloves. Even with these measures, 18% of active bone marrow is exposed to environmental radiation.
- **Scatter Radiation:** Most exposure occurs due to scatter from the patient near the beam. Use acrylic shields and stands to absorb scatter.
- **Distance:** Radiation intensity is proportional to the square root of the distance from the source. Using longer breathing circuits, intravenous lines, and Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA) can help.
- **ALARA Principle:** (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) refers to techniques minimizing ionising radiation exposure.

### Contrast Dyes
- **Agents:** Non-ionic agents (Iohexal, Iopamidol, Ioxilan) have better safety profiles and less potential for allergic reactions compared to older ionic agents.
- **Prevention of CIN:** Limiting contrast dose and ensuring adequate hydration are the only proven methods to prevent Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN).

## Indications for General Anaesthesia (GA)
1. Haemodynamic or respiratory instability requiring intervention (e.g., inotropes, intra-aortic balloon pumps), inability to lie flat, or lack of cooperation.
2. Children.
3. Anxious or claustrophobic adults.
4. Complex congenital heart disease requiring prolonged procedures.
5. Procedures needing transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), percutaneous valve ballooning or replacement, left atrial ablation, transseptal punctures, or testing of intracardiac defibrillating devices (ICD).

## Anaesthesia Techniques
- **Sedation and Local Anaesthesia:** Anaesthesia can be limited to local anaesthetic injection by the operator at the catheter insertion site, combined with light or moderate sedation administered by non-anaesthesia personnel.
- **Objective:** Produce an immobile, comfortable patient while minimizing cardiovascular effects. Drugs, ventilatory techniques, and oxygenation changes can interfere with pressure measurements and the conducting system of the heart.
- **Heparin Use:** Given during all intravascular procedures; during cardiac caths, the Activated Clotting Time (ACT) is usually maintained between 200 and 300 seconds (normal ACT approximately 80 seconds).

### Techniques
- Range from Monitored Anaesthesia Care (MAC), light to moderate to deep sedation, regional anaesthesia, to general anaesthesia using both inhalational and TIVA.

## Complications

## Procedures

### Diagnostic Coronary Angiography and Percutaneous Intervention (PCI)
- Typically performed under local anaesthesia with mild sedation.

### Balloon Valvotomies and Valve Stents
- Often require general anaesthesia due to cardiovascular symptoms and the use of TEE. Overdrive pacing is used during aortic valve ballooning to mitigate effects of sudden systemic vascular resistance increase.

## TAVI (Trans-catheter Aortic Valve Implantation)

### Introduction
- Initially for patients with severe aortic stenosis contraindicated for open heart surgery. Associated with lower mortality and fewer cardiac symptoms post-procedure and at one year, but higher major vascular complications and potential stroke risk compared to conventional open valve replacement.

### Indications and Contraindications
- **Indications:** High-risk patients or those contraindicated for surgery, as assessed by a multidisciplinary team.
- **Contraindications:** Congenital bicuspid/unicuspid valve, mechanical aortic valve, recent MI, severe mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, mixed valve disease, endocarditis, recent cerebrovascular accident, end-stage renal failure, incapacitating dementia, severe respiratory disease, life expectancy <12 months due to non-cardiac comorbidity.

### Anaesthesia for TAVI
- Often requires general anaesthesia with intubation, ventilation, and invasive monitoring. Blood availability for major haemorrhage, feasibility of rescue open valve replacement. Trans-ventricular pacing wires for overdrive pacing during stent deployment. TEE for stent guidance and problem identification.

### Pacemaker and ICD Insertion
- Usually performed under local anaesthesia with mild sedation.

## Electrophysiological (EP) Studies and Ablation Procedures

### Indications for Radio-Frequency Ablation
- **Curative:** Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia, accessory-pathway-mediated tachycardia, unifocal atrial tachycardia, WPW syndrome, Type 1 atrial flutter, idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, bundle-branch re-entry tachycardia, atypical atrial flutter, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, automatic junctional tachycardia, idiopathic ventricular premature depolarizations with severe symptoms.
- **Palliative:** Atrial fibrillation with uncontrolled ventricular rate (AV-node ablation), stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with coronary artery disease or other heart diseases.
- **Investigational/Undefined:** Linear atrial lesions, focal sources of atrial fibrillation, hemodynamically unstable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.
- **Not Indicated:** Multifocal atrial tachycardia (palliated with AV-node ablation), polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation.

### Effects of Anaesthetic Agents
1. **AV Nodal Conduction:** Slowed by propofol; ventricular repolarization prolonged by isoflurane (clinically insignificant).
2. **AVNRTs:** Suppressed by general anaesthesia; avoid volatiles, use TIVA.
3. **Qtc:** Shortened by propofol, no increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias.
4. **Nodal Function:** Remifentanil depresses SAN function; dexmedetomidine inhibits both SAN and AVN, increasing PR interval, inhibiting tachyarrhythmias induction.
5. **General Anaesthesia:** May improve outcomes for atrial fibrillation ablation.
