# Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings of Bronchiectasis

[Bronchiectasis Pathogenesis_Clacary](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Bronchiectasis-Pathogenesis-and-clinical-findings/)

## Pathogenesis

- Irreversibly Dilated Bronchi
- Chronic Bronchial Infection and Inflammation
- Easily Collapsible Airways

### Causes

### Clinical Features

- **Chronic Cough (Mucopurulent)**
	- Persistent bacteria in the airway (commonly Pseudomonas/Staphylococcus aureus)
	- Inflammatory response
- **Symptoms**: Rhinosinusitis, Fever
- **Failure to Thrive (Children)**
	- Defect in immunity and/or mucus clearance
	- Tissue damage
- **Obstructive Pulmonary Function Tests**
	- Structural damage to bronchial walls
- **Hemoptysis**
- **Chest Pain**
- **Persistent Inspiratory Adventitious Sounds (Crackles > Wheezing)**
	- Epithelial destruction of airways
	- Further impairment of bacterial clearance
- **Gas Exchange Issues**
	- V/Q mismatch and decreased gas exchange
	- Symptoms: Digital clubbing (rare), Fatigue, Dyspnea, Cyanosis (uncommon)

#### Notes

- Can be focal (single lobe/segment) or diffuse (both lungs)
- Mainly in elderly
- 1% prevalence in children
# CT and CXR of Bronchiectasis

[Bronchiectasis CT and CXR- Calgary](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Bronchiectasis:-Findings-on-Chest-X-Ray-and-CT-Scan/)

### Pathophysiology

- **Bronchiectasis**: Abnormal destruction and dilation of bronchi
- **Mechanism**:
	- Neutrophils, cytokines, nitric oxide, and radical oxygen species accumulate within lungs due to some inflammatory process
	- Bronchial and peribronchial inflammatory destruction
	- Elastic components of bronchi are destroyed
	- Loss of elastic tissue reduces bronchial wall integrity, allowing it to become looser
	- Bronchi remain dilated (whereas they would normally taper) as they extend distally

### Imaging Findings

1. **Abnormally Dilated Bronchi**
	- Bronchi become wider than the arteries that run alongside them (Bronchi diameter ratio >1.5)
	- **Signet Ring Sign on CT**: Air in bronchi appears black, and blood/contrast in the surrounding arteries appears white, creating a ring-like appearance
2. **Tramlines (aka Tram-Tracking) on CXR**
	- Outlining of dilated and thickened bronchi on imaging
3. **Bronchi Seen Within 1 cm of Pleura on CT**
	- Bronchi dilation makes the distal bronchi more visible on imaging
4. **Clusters of Grapes Sign on Axial CT**
	- Dilated bronchi may appear to crowd together in groups

# Anaesthesia and Bronchiectasis

## Overview

Bronchiectasis is characterized by localized irreversible dilatation of the bronchi due to destructive inflammatory processes involving the bronchial wall. This condition leads to airway collapse, airflow obstruction, and an inability to clear secretions effectively.

## Clinical Features

- **History**: Patients typically have a chronic purulent cough. Clubbing is often present, which is not a feature of COPD.
- **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT)**: Results can vary, showing no change, a COPD-like pattern, or a restrictive pattern.
- **Treatment**: Management includes antibiotics, physiotherapy, bronchodilators, steroids, and oxygen. Massive hemoptysis (>200 mL/24h) may require bronchial artery embolization (BAE) or surgical resection.

## Anaesthetic Issues

- Defer elective surgery if the patient is actively infected.
- Continue home medications until the morning of surgery.
- Frequent endotracheal tube (ETT) suctioning is necessary intraoperatively.
- Use a double-lumen tube (DLT) to prevent spillage if surgery is for empyema or hemoptysis.
- Avoid nasal ETT due to a high rate of chronic sinusitis.

## Considerations

- **Etiology & Co-existing Disease**: Consider conditions such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, tuberculosis, and congenital causes.
- **Risk of Postoperative Pulmonary Complications**:
	- Mixed restrictive and obstructive lung disease.
	- Risk of intraoperative bronchospasm, pneumothorax, and pulmonary tamponade.
	- Recurrent pulmonary infections and mucus plugging.
	- Hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.
	- Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale.
- **Potential Need for Lung Isolation**: This is necessary in cases of massive hemoptysis and active bronchial infection.
- **Medication**: Consider the need for steroid replacement therapy.

## Goals & Management

- **Maintain Lung Integrity**: Protect the healthy lung in the presence of infection and hemorrhage through lung isolation.
- **Preoperative Optimization**: Optimize the patientâ€™s condition preoperatively with antibiotics, steroids, and bronchodilators.
- **Intraoperative Ventilation**: Aim to avoid barotrauma, dynamic hyperinflation, and pulmonary tamponade.
- **Postoperative Care**: Be prepared for the possibility of postoperative ventilation and high acuity care.
