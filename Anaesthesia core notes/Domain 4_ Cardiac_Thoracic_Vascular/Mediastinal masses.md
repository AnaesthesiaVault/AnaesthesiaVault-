# Mediastinal Anatomy and Pathology

## Anatomy
- The mediastinum lies between the right and left pleurae, extending from the sternum in front to the vertebral column posteriorly. It contains all the thoracic viscera except the lungs. It extends from the connective tissues of the neck inferiorly to the diaphragm.
- T4 divides the mediastinum into inferior and superior sections.
- The inferior mediastinum is divided into anterior, middle, and posterior sections:
  - **Anterior**: From the sternum to the anterior pericardium.
  - **Middle**: From the anterior pericardium to the anterior aspect of the vertebral body.
  - **Posterior**: Includes the anterior and posterior portions of the vertebra, including the paravertebral gutters.

## Tumour Types According to Anatomy
- **Anterior and Middle Mediastinum**: Thymoma, germ cell tumours, and lymphoma.
- **Middle Mediastinum**: Pericardial or bronchogenic cysts, lymphoma, or granulomas.
- **Posterior Mediastinum**: Tumours of neurogenic origin.

## Common Tumour Types
- Lymphoma, thymoma, germ cell tumour, granuloma, bronchogenic carcinoma, thyroid tumours, bronchogenic cyst, and cystic hygroma.
- Lymphomatous tumours respond well to radiation and chemotherapy, but these treatments can alter the tissue histological diagnosis.

# Mediastinoscopy

## Overview
- Mediastinoscopy allows for the inspection and biopsy of mediastinal structures in a less invasive manner than thoracotomy.
- Types of mediastinoscopy:
  - **Cervical Mediastinoscopy (CMed)**: Used for paratracheal and pretracheal areas.
  - **Left Anterior Mediastinoscopy (LAM)**: Needed for the pre-aortic and aorto-pulmonary window.
  - **Video-Assisted Mediastinoscopy (VAM)**: The gold standard.

## Indications
- Staging of lung cancer.
- Obtaining tissue biopsies of suspected tumours.

## Complications
- **Rate**: 1.5-3.0%
- **Common**: Pneumothorax, hemorrhage, recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury, arterial compression, tracheal compression, dysrhythmia.
- **Uncommon**: Phrenic nerve injury, chylothorax, oesophageal injury, air embolism, stroke, infection, tumour implantation.

## Contra-indications (Relative)
- Previous mediastinoscopy (10% complication rate).
- Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome (major hemorrhage up to 12%).
- Cardiovascular disease (CVD).
- Thoracic aortic aneurysm (AA).
- Severe tracheal deviation.

## Preoperative Assessment
- **Mass effect**
	  - Note respiratory symptoms and if they worsen in the supine position.
	  - Airways + lungs (SOB, RR, hoarseness, stridor, hemoptysis, cough).
	  - Look for compression symptoms: dysphagia, dyspnoea, voice changes.
		  - Heart + vasculature (chest pain, SOB, syncope/presyncope, hypotension, assess for SVC syndrome).
	  - Signs of SVC obstruction: Pemberton's sign.
	  - Esophagus (dysphagia).
- **Treatment History**:
	   - Chemotherapy (side effects).
	   - Radiotherapy (respiratory tract scarring/fibrosis, airway friability, esophagitis, and airway swelling).
- **Paraneoplastic Syndromes**:
	- Myasthenia Gravis (MG) with thymic mass.
### Mediastinal Syndrome

[View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.](https://whimsical.com/mediastinal-syndrome-KpgVh1PqShifV27HjtD6bm?ref=chatgpt)

### Investigations
- **Chest X-ray (CXR)**.
- **CT Scan**: Evaluate the size, site, severity, and degree of compression of vital structures.
- **Lung Function Tests**: Generally not useful.
#### Localization of Mediastinal Mass
**General CXR signs**
	- Unlike lung lesions, a mediastinal mass will not contain air bronchograms.
	- The margins with the lung will be obtuse.
	- Mediastinal lines (azygoesophageal recess, anterior and posterior junction lines) will be disrupted.
	- There can be associated spinal, costal or sternal abnormalities.
**Anterior:** Hilum overlay sign (mostly), silhouette sign (heart border obliterated)
**Middle:** Displaced azygoesophageal recess on the right; pseudoparavertebral line on the left
**Posterior:** Cervicothoracic Sign

### Special Considerations
- **Thymoma and Myasthenia Gravis (MG)**:
  - One-third of thymoma patients will have MG.
  - Only 10% of MG patients will have thymoma.
- **Lung Cancer and Paraneoplastic Syndromes**:
  - 2-12% prevalence.
  - Includes Cushing's syndrome, SIADH, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, carcinoid syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy.
- **Complications**:
  - Compression of vital structures may become more apparent after induction due to the loss of spontaneous ventilation (SV), chest wall tone, and patient positioning.
  - Obstruction usually occurs at the level of the carina (distal to the endotracheal tube [ETT]), potentially causing complete obstruction. Use a micro-laryngeal cuff to pass the mass and prepare for jet ventilation.

## Decision Making

![[Pasted image 20231106165559.png]]

## Principles of Anaesthesia

1. **Local Anesthesia (LA)** should be strongly considered over General Anesthesia (GA) if any of the CT scan, Flow Volume Loop, or ECHO have positive findings.
2. **If tracheal compression is present** and LA is not possible, keep the patient breathing spontaneously with a reinforced ETT. Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and positive pressure ventilation (PPV) are contraindicated.
3. **In the absence of airway compression**, NMB is useful to prevent coughing which can cause trauma or venous engorgement. Keep pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) low for venous return. Avoid nitrous oxide (N₂O).
4. **Monitoring**:
   - SpO₂ on the right hand (loss indicates brachiocephalic/innominate compression, necessitating repositioning) and NIBP/IBP on the left.
   - Increased PAWP should prompt removal/replacement of the scope.
   - Bradycardia or sudden BP changes should prompt immediate repositioning of the scope ± Atropine.

5. **Other Measures**: Use a lateral chest wall roll and obtain a postoperative CXR to exclude pneumothorax.
6. **Other Concerns**: SVC obstruction, MMS, and air embolism (especially if spontaneous ventilation is lost). Thymomas can cause a myasthenic syndrome.

### Conduct of Anaesthesia

#### Preservation of Spontaneous Breathing
- Avoid heavy preoperative sedation.
- Consider inhalational induction.
- Assess hemodynamics and airway patency with positive pressure breathing.
- Utilize short-acting muscle relaxants.

#### Intubation Beyond the Point of Obstruction
- Use an armored endotracheal tube, long endotracheal tube, double-lumen endotracheal tube, or rigid bronchoscope.

#### Backup Plan
- Position change.
- Helium-oxygen mixture.
- Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
- Emergency sternotomy.

### Specific Interventions for Airway

Airway Obstruction/Loss of Cardiac Output or SVC Obstruction

**Airway Obstruction**
- Awake fiber-optic intubation.
- Spontaneous ventilation.
- Position change if obstruction increases.
- Intubate distal to mass with an armored tube.
- Endobronchial intubation.
- Rigid bronchoscopy.
- Cardiopulmonary bypass.

**Loss of Cardiac Output**
- Rotate the patient (mass into the dependent position).
- Maintain preload.
- Avoid vasodilators and negative inotropes.
- Use cardiopulmonary bypass if necessary.

**SVC Obstruction**
- Ensure adequate intravenous catheter (IVC) access.
- Keep the head of the bed elevated.
- Administer steroids and diuretics (if tolerated).
- Be prepared for significant blood loss.
