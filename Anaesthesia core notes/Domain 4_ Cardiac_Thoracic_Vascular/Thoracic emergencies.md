# Introduction

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a useful technique for dealing with late complications such as retained hemothorax, posttraumatic empyema, and bronchopleural fistula.

## General Approach

1. **ATLS**
	1. The general principles of trauma anesthesia such as oxygenation, restoration of circulating volume, correction of hypothermia, and coagulopathy certainly apply to patients with thoracic injuries.
2. The standard approach for securing a definitive airway is direct laryngoscopy and rapid sequence intubation with cricoid pressure and manual in-line immobilization of the cervical spine after clinical assessment of the airway.
	1. Preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3–4 minutes is not always possible in the agitated trauma patient.
	2. Many institutions do not undertake lung isolation techniques for emergency trauma thoracotomy. Double-lumen tubes are often difficult to insert during rapid sequence intubation and are commonly associated with malposition. Anesthesiologists with limited experience in thoracic anesthesia fail to successfully place lung isolation devices in over a third of patients.
	3. Worsening hypotension and difficulty with ventilation should prompt consideration of a diagnosis of tension pneumothorax until proven otherwise.
3. Monitoring should include direct arterial and central venous pressures and, if indicated, TEE and BIS.

# Pulmonary Contusions

## Pathophysiology

- Pulmonary contusion, present in 25–35% of blunt chest trauma, is often associated with flail chest.
- Risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, and long-term respiratory dysfunction. Although mortality of 10–25% has been reported.
- Parenchymal hemorrhage, interstitial edema, and decreased surfactant production result in alveolar collapse and consolidation.
- These contribute to ventilation/perfusion mismatch, pulmonary shunting, and decreased lung compliance.

## Clinical Signs

- Tachypnea, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, wheezing, and hemoptysis.

## Diagnosis

- Chest radiograph changes are often delayed. The contusion may appear two to three times larger on computed tomography scan.

## Management

- Treatment modalities include:
	- Noninvasive and invasive ventilation, high-frequency and differential lung ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and surfactant.
	- Mechanical ventilation utilizing low (6 ml/kg) tidal volumes, high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, and permissive hypercarbia may protect the lung from further insult.
- Optimal pain control is crucial in the management of significant chest wall injuries, to enable effective deep breathing and coughing.
	- Epidural analgesia may be useful.
- Large flail segments may require mechanical ventilation, the duration of which is possibly shortened by operative fixation of the rib fractures.
- Fracture of the first and second ribs requires major force and should always prompt a search for significant intrathoracic trauma including aortic injury.

## Sudden Cardiovascular Collapse with PPV

- Sudden cardiovascular or neurological dysfunction, dyspnea, and hemoptysis occurring after initiation of positive pressure ventilation in thoracic trauma victims is a classic presentation of systemic air embolism, which may occur if there is a bronchial–pulmonary communication.
	- TEE may be diagnostic.
	- Management includes minimizing inspiratory pressures, intravascular volume loading, dependent positioning of the injured lung, and thoracotomy with hilar clamping.

## EAST Management Guidelines

- Standard trauma evaluation/resuscitation.
- No excessive fluid restriction. Resuscitate as necessary with isotonic crystalloid or colloid, then avoid fluids.
- Diuretics only for fluid overload/CCF.
- No mechanical ventilation if no respiratory failure. MV according to institutional/physician preferences, terminate when no longer needed. Include PEEP and CPAP.
- Appropriate analgesia. TEA preferred. No evidence for PVB.
- Aggressive chest physiotherapy.
- No steroids.
- Consider surgical fixation of flail chest when failing to wean from ventilation or when thoracotomy is required for other reasons.

# Tracheal-Bronchial Tree Disruption

- 76% occur within 2.5 cm of the carina, a relatively fixed point.
- The goal is to improve ventilation and reduce the effects of air leak into surrounding structures by placing a cuffed airway distal to the injury. A definitive airway can usually be secured using a fiber-optic bronchoscope while maintaining spontaneous ventilation.
- Rigid bronchoscopy may be required if there is severe airway disruption and bleeding, but this is contraindicated in patients with an unstable cervical spine.

## Algorithm of Key Management Points of Airway Disruption

A. **Maintain spontaneous ventilation**, even with modified rapid-sequence intubation techniques.

B. **Place endotracheal tube below level of tear**.

C. **Do not pressurize above level of tear**.

D. **Do not use transtracheal jet ventilation or a laryngeal mask airway with positive pressure**.

E. **Consider use of a double-lumen tube, 2 small-diameter tubes, or a single-lumen tube with bronchial blocker**.

F. **Consider cardiopulmonary bypass via femoral route for major tears**.

G. **Do an awake fiber optic intubation for all major tears**.

H. **If above interventions are not adequate or are not working, go directly to surgical airway maintenance**.

# Hemothorax

- An ICC should be sited early–certainly well before signs of shock become apparent, by which time up to half the blood volume may have been lost into one hemithorax.
- Rapid drainage of greater than 1500 ml blood from the ICC after insertion (massive hemothorax) is an indication for urgent thoracotomy.
- In patients who are relatively stable, with less severe ongoing bleeding (e.g., less than 200 ml/h from the ICC for 2–4 hours or less than 1500 ml in 24 hours).
- VATS can control ongoing hemorrhage with a success rate of up to 82%.

# Diaphragmatic Injury

- Studies have shown that VATS has a sensitivity and specificity for detecting diaphragmatic injury of 97-100%, with an accuracy of about 98%.

# Cardiac Contusion

- RV and IVS frequently involved.
- The main concerns are:
	- Risk of arrhythmias.
	- Ventricular dysfunction, which may occur as a result of impaired contractility or structural damage to the valves or chamber walls.
- Arrhythmias on presentation (commonly ventricular ectopics) or ST-segment changes should arouse suspicion of a cardiac injury. In a patient with otherwise minor trauma, a normal ECG at admission can exclude the risk of significant blunt cardiac injury, eliminating the need for cardiac monitoring if not otherwise indicated.
- If the admission ECG is abnormal, the patient should have continuous ECG monitoring for 24–48 hours. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, an echocardiographic assessment of preload, myocardial contractility, pericardial collections, and myocardial and valvular structures should be performed.
- Measurement of troponin probably has little value in the management of blunt cardiac injury.
- It may be prudent to delay nonurgent surgery for a period of 24–48 hours after significant injury to allow some recovery of the abnormal myocardium and conducting system. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be considered if there is cardiogenic shock.

# Aortic Injuries

- Blunt aortic injury, typically caused by high-speed motor vehicle accidents, is the second most common cause of death in blunt trauma.
- 85% die at the scene.
	- Half of those that survive to hospital die within 24 hours.
- The most common site of injury is at the aortic isthmus just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery because of tethering of the ligamentum.
- Survivors have intact adventitial layers or contained hematoma within the mediastinum and pseudoaneurysm, although blunt aortic injury can be limited to subtle intimal flaps, which are challenging to detect radiologically unless there is coexisting dissection.

## Diagnosis

- CT best.
- CXR and TEE.

## Treatment

- Low mortality rates, excellent technical success, and shorter hospital stay mean that endovascular stent grafting (EVSG) may be evolving into first-line treatment for aortic injury.
- Conventional immediate open surgery and repair is associated with mortality rates of up to 28% with paraplegia in a further 6–19% depending on the surgical technique.
- There have been advances over the past decade, and advocates of both passive and active methods of distal aortic perfusion during cross-clamping have reported decreased spinal cord ischemia and reduced mortality rates.

## Timing

- The timing of treatment remains controversial, but if the patient has more immediately life-threatening injuries, then EVSG can be delayed.

## Complications

- Procedure-related complications was 12% (vs. 20% with open surgery) including several strokes, but there was no paraplegia. Paraplegia is certainly described after elective descending thoracic endograft.

## Anesthesia

- Although EVSG is performed in the radiology suite, the anesthetic principles and standards of monitoring are the same as those generally applicable to open thoracic aortic surgery.
- The anesthetic goals for open aortic surgery are to:
	- Reduce shear stress in the aortic walls by meticulous blood pressure control (systolic blood pressure less than 140 mmHg) using beta-blockade and glyceryl trinitrate.
	- Aggressive treatment with sodium nitroprusside during proximal aortic cross-clamping may be associated with a higher incidence of postoperative paraplegia.
- Duration of cross-clamping is a key determinant of outcome and spinal cord protection is critical.
- Mild hypothermia (e.g., 34°C) during cross-clamping may provide some benefit, but rewarming should be undertaken as soon as possible to avoid complications of hypothermia such as coagulopathy.
- Inability to tolerate single lung ventilation, systemic heparinization, or increased intracranial pressure due to aortic cross-clamping may all complicate operative management.
