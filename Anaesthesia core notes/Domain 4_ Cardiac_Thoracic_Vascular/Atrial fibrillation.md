## AF Classification
- Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia, increasing in prevalence and incidence
- **Paroxysmal AF**: Terminates spontaneously within 7 days of onset
- **Persistent AF**: Lasts >7 days and/or requires cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm (SR)
- **Permanent AF**: Persistent AF, no longer pursuing rhythm control strategies
- **Perioperative AF (POAF)**
	- 1%: minor surgery
	- 5-10%: vascular or large colorectal surgery
	- New-onset POAF occurs principally after thoracic and cardiac surgery
		- Very low after exploratory thoracotomy or minimal resections of the lung, but higher after larger lung resections or esophagogastrectomy (10–30%)
		- The incidence of POAF after cardiac surgery remains high: 30% after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, 40% after valve surgery, and 50% after combined procedures.
		- 15% for TAVI
	- The time course of POAF (70% in the first 4 postoperative days) highlights the importance of temporary surgery-induced factors such as inflammation, sympathetic stimulation (probably the most relevant). and oxidative stress
- Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke fivefold
- Increased hemodynamic instability, increased thromboembolic risk, and the management of OAC with or without heparin bridging
# Risk Factors
## Risk Factors for AF

- **Traditional**: age, hypertension, male sex, diabetes, valvular heart disease, heart failure, coronary heart disease, cardiac surgery, hyperthyroidism
- **Emerging**: obesity, chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea, excess alcohol consumption, genetic factors
## Risk Factors for Perioperative AF (POAF)

### Patient
- Advancing age, left atrial enlargement, obesity, previous history of AF, male gender, hypertension, COPD, heart failure, withdrawal of β-blockers, genetic factors
### Perioperative Factors for POAF

- Surgical (atrial suture or ischemia)
- Inflammation, oxidative stress
- Sympathetic stimulation
- Acute volume changes
### Triggering Factors for POAF

- Electrolyte imbalance
- Atrial premature contraction
- Enhanced adrenergic or vagal stimulation
### Risk Stratification for Bleeding

Note: HAS-BLED has been validated for warfarin, but not for the new anticoagulants.

0-2 is low risk

More than 3 is high risk for bleeding

# Treatment of Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation (POAF)

## Management Steps
1. **Management of Co-existing Medical Conditions**
   - Identify and treat any underlying medical conditions contributing to POAF.

2. **Cardioversion for Hemodynamically Unstable Patients**
   - Electrical cardioversion is recommended for patients who are hemodynamically unstable.

3. **Rate-Control Strategy for Stable Patients**
   - For hemodynamically stable patients, a rate-control strategy is often first-line.
	 - Atrioventricular nodal-blocking agents such as beta-blockers, or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel antagonists (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil) are preferred.
	 - Amiodarone can be used to control heart rate independently of its rhythm-conversion effects.

4. **Rhythm-Control Strategy**
   - If atrial fibrillation (AF) does not convert to sinus rhythm within 24 hours, a rhythm-control strategy should be pursued, with concurrent anticoagulation.
   - Cardioversion is indicated for patients with a definitive AF onset of less than 48 hours, especially if they have risk factors for stroke.
### Note
- POAF is often transient and self-limiting. Many patients, particularly those who have undergone non-cardiac surgery, may not require antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) or anticoagulation therapy.
## Prevention of POAF
- **Beta-Blockers Continuation**
  - Continuing beta-blockers is recommended.
- **Combination Therapy Evaluation**
  - The impact of a combination regimen including beta-blockers, amiodarone, statins, magnesium, and corticosteroids is still under evaluation.
## Anticoagulation Management

### Management of Patients on NOAC

Current guidelines for bridging NOAC before major surgery are cautious

	- European and French societies recommend a schema similar to VKA management, with an interruption of oral therapy for 4 days before surgery and heparin bridging if necessary

- (1) Medically manage atrial fibrillation and continue anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation for minor surgeries or those in which high blood loss is unlikely. Discontinue anticoagulation in surgical patients at high risk of bleeding (with appropriate bridging strategies as indicated), but resume as soon as the risk of surgical bleeding is considered to be low (Opinion-based evidence, Category A).
(2) There is no evidence to suggest that continuation of aspirin in patients at risk for vascular complications reduces the risk of stroke after noncardiac surgery (Category A, Level 3).

# Anaesthesia for AF

## Perioperative Considerations for Patients with Atrial Fibrillation
### Preoperative
- Assess patient-related risk factors
	- Investigation for underlying causes (cardiopulmonary disease, ongoing MI, drug toxicity, endocrine / metabolic) - time permitting - Cardiology consult?
	- Pre-existing AF / RVR: IV Diltiazem / β-Blockers for rate control → consider delaying elective if unsuccessful or other cmb (MI / CCF / PE)  
- Formulate plan for anticoagulation
	- Meds: Rate controllers - continue until DOS. Anticoagulation - case by case risk of stroke vs bleeding); Bridging?*  
- Evaluate for causes of NOAF
- Continue AV nodal blocking agents until morning of surgery
- Consider delaying surgery in patients with AF RVR despite rate control therapy
#### Intraoperative
- Avoid and treat surgery-related risk factors/triggers
- Treat unstable AF RVR with electrical cardioversion
- Treat stable AF RVR with rate control agents ( β-Blocker > CCB1; Amiodarone is a reasonable alternative)
- Consider TEE in high-risk patients to evaluate causes and guide therapy
- Avoid arrhythmogenic drugs and those associated with sympathetic stimulation
- Fluid status, electrolytes (NB: K < 3.5), metabolic abn's, CVC tip, Avoid Des
#### Postoperative
- Consider CPAP in patients with OSA
- POCUS in patients with hemodynamic instability
- Treat unstable AF with cardioversion
- Treat stable AF with rate control agents
- Continue rate control agents at discharge with follow-up
- Antithrombotic therapy when appropriate
- Other investigations: Troponin, X-ray
- Restart usual rate controllers
- Anticoagulants - start or re-initiate case by case (src)
- Discharge on rate control agents for 1-6 weeks → cardiology follow up
- *DOAC interruption without bridging may be acceptable. If bridging To UFH, discontinue 4-6h prior; LMWH 24h.
Amio dose: 150mg bolus, then 1mg/min infusion*
##### Surgery-related Triggers
- Sympathetic stimulation  
- Hyperor hypovolemia
- Electrolyte disturbances
- Hypoxia  
- Hypotension
# Complications of AF

[Complications of AF](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/atrial-fibrillation-complications/)

- Disorganized atrial depolarizations without effective atrial contraction
## Pathophysiology

1. **Ineffective atrial contraction**
	- Blood stasis in left atrium and atrial appendage
	- Atrial clot formation and embolization
		- **Brain**: TIA/stroke, dementia
		- **Kidneys**: renal artery occlusion
		- **Gut**: mesenteric ischemia
		- **Peripheral arteries**: acute arterial occlusion
2. **Irregular, rapid ventricular response rate**
	- ↓ Diastolic filling time
	- ↓ Preload (↓ LVEDV)
	- Decompensated Frank-Starling response
		- ↓ Stroke volume (SV)
		- ↓ Cardiac output (CO)
		- Pre-existing coronary, myocardial, or valvular disease
		- **Myocardial ischemia** and infarction
3. **Tachycardia-induced cardiac remodeling and dilatation**

	- Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy
	- **Heart failure**
#### Risk Factors
- Previous stroke
- Mitral disease
- Age >65
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- Heart failure
- Female sex
- Vascular disease
