# Infective Endocarditis
## Introduction

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a predominantly bacterial infection affecting native or prosthetic heart valves or the cardiac endocardial surface. Despite being a rare disease (3-15 per 100,000 people annually), its incidence is increasing. Mortality remains high at 20% in-hospital and 30% after one year. Risk factors vary globally, with rheumatic valve disease common in developing countries and congenital or degenerative valvular diseases, prosthetic valves, or cardiovascular implantable electronic devices more prevalent in developed countries. Non-cardiac risk factors include IV drug use, indwelling intravascular devices, compromised immunity, and cancer.

## Definition
  - Microbial infection of a heart valve (native or prosthetic) or the mural endocardium, leading to tissue destruction and formation of vegetations.
  - Multisystem disorder.
- Incidence: 1.7–7.2 cases per 100,000 persons.
- Female to male ratio: 1:2.
- Median age of endocarditis patients: 47-69 years.
## Aetiology

- **Causative Agents:**:
	- **Staphylococcus aureus:** 31–54%, more common than oral streptococci.
	- **Coagulase-negative Staphylococci:** Main cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis.
	- **Gram-negative HACEK group:** Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae, mainly affecting native valves.
	- **Fungi (Candida and Aspergillus):** In drug abusers, prosthetic-valve recipients, and patients with long-term central venous catheters.

## Pathogenesis
### Acute Endocarditis
- **Predisposing Factors:**
  - Pre-existing valvular stenosis or regurgitation.
  - Poor dental hygiene/recent dental procedure.
  - Intravenous (IV) drug use (mostly causes right-sided endocarditis).
  - Invasive procedure/indwelling device.
- **Mechanism:**
  - Non-laminar flow across valves damages valve endothelium.
  - A sterile thrombus forms on the surface of a cardiac valve.
  - Valve trauma or invading bacteria can damage the valve endothelium.
  - Bacteria enter the bloodstream (bacteremia) and adhere to the thrombus on the cardiac valve endothelium.

### Infective Endocarditis
- **Infection Development:**
  - Infection of the thrombus typically produces a vegetation on the flow surface of a valve.
  - Bacteria adhere to the thrombus and colonize it.
  - In subacute cases, valvular abnormality is usually present beforehand.
- **Immune Response:**
  - Activation of the immune system leading to malaise, chills, and fever (≥38°C).
  - Positive blood cultures indicating the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream.
- **Immune Complex Formation:**
  - Immune complexes (antibody-antigen complexes) form secondary to infection.
  - Complexes deposit in organs, causing complications.
### Pathophysiology
- IE originates at sites where the endothelium is damaged by high blood velocity or mechanical damage and on foreign bodies in the circulation.
- Initially, a sterile thrombotic vegetation (non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis) forms, facilitating bacterial adherence during transient bacteremia.
- Platelets and fibrin deposits at the injury site provide an adherent surface for the formation of vegetations.
- The vegetations produce secondary effects such as tissue destruction, generalized sepsis, septic emboli, and abscesses.
#### Summary
- **Bacteremia:** Pathogens enter the bloodstream.
- **Adhesion:** Pathogens attach to damaged or inflamed cardiac endothelial surfaces.
- **Proliferation:** Platelets and fibrin form vegetations.
- **Biofilm Formation:** Progression leads to structural damage and septic embolization in organs like the brain, kidneys, and skin.

## Complications
- **Vegetations:**
  - Vegetations can be seen on ultrasound/echocardiogram.
  - In all cases, vegetations form on affected valves.
- **Valvular Damage:**
  - Mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency (valve involvement: Mitral > Aortic > Tricuspid).
  - Valve destruction leads to valvular function failure (valve insufficiency).
- **Immune Complex Deposits:**
  - Immune complex deposits in kidneys cause damage to glomeruli (glomerulonephritis).
  - Immune complexes cause vasculitis in retinal vessels, leading to Roth’s spots (retinal hemorrhages with pale centers due to coagulated fibrin).
- **Embolic Events:**
  - Parts of vegetation embolize, obstructing arteries.
  - Blood flow to organs is perfused by the obstructed arteries, leading to organ infarction and tissue death.
  - Smaller emboli block smaller vessels in hands/feet, causing microinfarctions.

#### Risk Assessment and Scores

- **Risk Scores:**
	- Various IE-specific risk scores exist, but their applicability varies.
	- Local validation of risk scores can improve their reliability.
	- EuroSCORE II has shown the most reliability in our institution (unpublished data).
## Indications for Urgent Surgery
1. **Heart Failure:**

	- **Definition:** Severe acute valve regurgitation, valve obstruction, or fistula.
	- **Cause:** Results from structural damage to the heart valves.
2. **Uncontrolled Infection:**
	
	- **Definition:** Persistent infection despite antibiotic therapy.
	- **Cause:** Virulent pathogens such as fungi or multiresistant organisms, or local complications like abscesses, false aneurysms, or fistulas.
3. **Prevention of Systemic Embolic Events:**
	
	- **Risk:** Large mobile vegetations (greater than 10 mm in length) that pose a high risk of embolization, particularly to the brain.

### Timing of Surgery

- **Guidelines Overview:**
	
	- **American Heart Association (AHA) / American College of Cardiology (ACC):** Recommend early surgical intervention during initial hospitalization, irrespective of whether full antibiotic therapy has been completed.
	- **European Society of Cardiology (ESC) / Japanese Circulation Society (JCS):** Differentiate between emergency surgery (within 24 hours of diagnosis), urgent surgery (within a few days), and elective surgery (after completion of antibiotic therapy). Urgent surgery is recommended for most indications.
	- **American Association of Thoracic Surgeons (AATS):** Advocates for aggressive and immediate surgical treatment, ideally within days of indication, especially for patients with large mobile vegetations to prevent cerebral embolization.
- **Trend Toward Earlier Surgery:**
	
	- Supported by evidence from a randomized controlled trial, several observational studies, and a meta-analysis indicating lower mortality with early surgery.
	- However, some studies suggest that very early surgery might not always improve outcomes, highlighting the necessity of multidisciplinary team discussions.

### Surgery and Cerebrovascular Complications

- **Timing Controversy:**
	- **Risk:** Perioperative intracranial hemorrhage.
	- **Evidence:**
		- Retrospective studies indicate early surgery after embolic stroke does not worsen outcomes and may decrease the risk of further complications.
		- Delaying surgery post-embolic stroke may increase the risk of neurologic and non-neurologic complications.
	- **Guidelines:**
		- Recommend surgery without delay after stroke or subclinical cerebral embolization if there is no severe neurologic damage.
		- Surgery should be delayed for at least four weeks in cases of major ischemic stroke with severe neurologic damage or intracranial hemorrhage.
	- **Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR):**
		- Surgery does not generally improve outcomes for IE post-TAVR complicated by stroke.
# Prophylaxis

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311150152.png)

- **General Consideration:**
	- Routine prophylaxis is not recommended.
	- Antibiotic prophylaxis is still recommended in high-risk patients with an actual infection at the operative site (e.g., acquired valvular heart disease, previous valve replacement, or structural congenital heart disease excluding repaired atrial or ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus).

## Groups of Patients Requiring IE Prophylaxis Prior to Surgery

1. **Prosthetic Cardiac Valve**
2. **History of IE**
3. **Congenital Heart Diseases:**
	- (i) Cyanotic CHD Unrepaired
	- (ii) Cyanotic CHD Repaired within the last 6 months
	- (iii) Cardiac transplant recipients with valvular disease
4. **Cardiac Transplantation with Valvular Heart Disease (VHD)**

### Surgical Procedures Requiring IE Prophylaxis

1. All dental procedures
2. Invasive respiratory tract procedures involving incision or biopsy of mucosa
3. Procedures involving infected skin

## Antibiotic Agents for IE Prophylaxis

- All antibiotics should be administered 30-60 minutes before the procedure.

1. **Amoxicillin:** 2 g PO
2. **Cannot take orally:** Ampicillin 2 g IV/IM
3. **Allergic to Penicillin:**
	- Clindamycin 600 mg PO
	- Cephalexin 2 g PO
4. **Allergic to Penicillin and cannot take orally:** Clindamycin 600 mg IV

## Treatment

- Patients with IE and large vegetations, intracardiac abscess (9-14%), or persisting infection (9-11%) almost always need surgery.

## Antibiotic Prophylaxis and Treatment for the More Frequent Causes of IE

|Clinical Situation|Agent|Dosage and Route|Duration|
|---|---|---|---|
|**A. Prophylaxis**|Amoxicillin|2 g p.o. or i.v.|Single dose|
|**B. Prophylaxis (allergic to penicillin)**|Clindamycin|600 mg p.o. or i.v.|Single dose|

## Perioperative Issues

### Coagulation, Bleeding, and Transfusion in Patients with Infective Endocarditis

#### General Disease-related Alterations

Infective endocarditis (IE) involves a complex interaction between inflammation and coagulation, termed "immunothrombosis." Upon bacterial recognition, endothelial cells are activated by cytokines, releasing tissue factor, which activates the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Additionally, coagulation factor XII activates the intrinsic pathway. This cascade cleaves prothrombin to form thrombin, activating platelets and converting fibrinogen to fibrin. Platelets and fibrin are crucial components of IE lesions and valvular vegetations.

Potential coagulation disorders, such as inherited thrombophilia, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20201A mutation, and hyperhomocysteinemia, may increase IE risk. A hypercoagulable state can mature endocarditis lesions and cause thromboembolic events, with embolic risk associated with platelet factor 4 and mean platelet volume.

Rotational thromboelastometry can predict thromboembolic complications in noncardiac surgeries and malignancies, suggesting potential use in IE patients pending further studies.

#### Anticoagulation

Effective anticoagulation during cardiac valve surgery using CPB is essential, monitored by activated clotting time (ACT). Patients with IE often exhibit heparin resistance, characterized by lower antithrombin III activity and higher fibrinogen levels. Preoperative point-of-care coagulation testing may predict heparin resistance, treated with escalating heparin doses, antithrombin, or fresh frozen plasma. Treatment preferences vary, with antithrombin concentrates being common.

Alternative anticoagulation strategies, such as bivalirudin or nafamostat, require further clinical evaluation for safety in IE.

### Bleeding and Transfusion

The direct impact of IE on bleeding risk is unclear. Normocytic-normochromic anemia is common, and surgery may involve multiple valves and abscess formation, increasing CPB time, transfusion needs, and bleeding risks. Balancing bleeding risk and thrombotic complications is crucial. Emergency procedures involving anticoagulants complicate management, potentially leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation in severe cases.

Perioperative coagulation treatment algorithms reduce transfusions, but their applicability to IE patients needs validation. Antifibrinolytic therapy, such as tranexamic acid, reduces blood loss and transfusion rates but may increase thrombotic events. Fibrinogen levels are elevated in IE, reducing the need for fibrinogen supplementation despite surgery-related decreases.

Specific pathogens like S. aureus or Streptococcus gallolyticus affect coagulation, and certain antibiotics may cause significant bleeding complications.

### CPB Considerations

Prolonged CPB and aortic cross-clamp times increase morbidity and mortality in IE patients, who are more susceptible to prolonged CPB effects due to inflammation. Inflammatory mediators during surgery may increase cytokine levels, influencing outcomes. Steroids' effects on inflammatory responses and mortality in cardiac surgery are uncertain, with routine use not recommended.

Hemoadsorption to remove inflammatory mediators shows promise but needs further verification in randomized controlled trials. Available devices in Europe may not be approved in the U.S. for IE patients.

### Management of Organ Dysfunction

#### Cerebrovascular Disease

Neurologic events in IE are common, with ischemic stroke being the most prevalent. Early antimicrobial therapy and anticoagulation avoidance are crucial. IV thrombolysis is generally not indicated; endovascular treatment might be useful in selected cases. Early surgery post-ischemic stroke is feasible, while hemorrhagic stroke surgery is delayed for 4 weeks. Preoperative neurologic assessment and post-operative reassessment are essential. Postoperative cerebral events may require endovascular thrombectomy.

#### Circulatory Dysfunction

Acute heart failure, due to valve insufficiency, vegetation, or abscess formation, indicates urgent surgery. Septic shock complicates management, requiring individualized treatment. Hemodynamic instability is common post-CPB, requiring intensive monitoring and possibly mechanical support.

#### Renal Dysfunction

Acute renal failure is frequent in IE, associated with poor prognosis. Causes include immune-mediated glomerulonephritis, embolic infarction, and antibiotic toxicity. Management focuses on antibiotics, surgery, and supportive therapy.

#### Pulmonary Complications

Predominantly in right-sided IE, complications include pulmonary embolization, infarction, pneumonia, and abscess formation. Treatment involves antibiotic therapy and device removal, with surgery less common than for left-sided IE.

#### Liver Dysfunction and Splenic Complications

Preexisting liver disease worsens IE prognosis, with severe liver dysfunction linked to hypoxic hepatitis and perioperative bleeding. Splenic abscesses require drainage or splenectomy, performed before cardiac surgery when possible.

### Postoperative Care

Postoperative complications include septic shock, heart failure, coagulopathy, renal failure, stroke, and conduction abnormalities. Meticulous coagulation management and monitoring of antibiotic levels are crucial. Lifelong follow-up prevents reinfection, with recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis during procedures causing bacteremia.
