# Oesophagectomy

## Introduction
- **Epidemiology**: Oesophageal cancer is the eighth most common malignancy worldwide with an increasing incidence. At initial presentation, 20-30% of patients have metastases.
- **Surgical Procedure**:
  - Involves excision of the oesophagus and relocation of the stomach in the mediastinum to form a gastric conduit connecting the pharynx to the remaining gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with the abdominal stage performed first.
  - The anastomosis is at the extreme end of the foregutâ€™s blood supply, making it vulnerable to ischaemia without careful management of haemodynamic parameters and fluid to ensure its perfusion.
  - In revision oesophagectomy, a colonic interposition is performed using a section of the colon on a pedicle.
  - This is a high-risk procedure with multiple vulnerable anastomoses.
## Considerations
- **High Risk for Postoperative Morbidity & Mortality**:
  - Identify surgical approach & associated considerations.
  - Possible need for lung isolation.
  - **Comorbid Disease Processes**:
	- Full stomach & high risk for aspiration.
	- Malnourishment, deconditioning, anemia, coagulopathy.
	- Smoker, chronic obstructive lung disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus.
  - **Cancer 4M's**:
	- Mass effects, medications, metastases, metabolic abnormalities.
  - **Prolonged Surgery with Severe Hemodynamic Insults**:
	- Need for invasive monitors & access.
	- Lung protective ventilation.
  - **Maintenance of Anastomotic Integrity**:
	- Thoracic epidural anesthesia.
	- Judicious fluid administration & vasopressor usage.
	- Optimize oxygen delivery.

### Risk Factors for Perioperative Morbidity & Mortality
- Poor cardiac and/or pulmonary function.
- Advanced age.
- Tumour stage.
- Diabetes mellitus.
- Impaired general health.
- Hepatic dysfunction.
- Peripheral vascular disease.
- Smoker.
- Chronic use of steroids.

### Goals & Conflict
#### Preoperative
- **Assessment of 4M's**:
  - Optimization of comorbidities.
  - Planning for postoperative care.
- **Optimization**:
  - Smoking cessation.
  - Correct/optimise anemia.
  - Nutrition: Patients may be cachectic or obese, but even obese patients may be malnourished due to hypermetabolic state.
	- Patients taking <75% of caloric goals require supplementation.
	- Patients taking less than 50% of caloric goals require tube feeds.
  - Rehabilitation with physiotherapy is emerging.

#### Intraoperative
- **Aspiration Prophylaxis**:
  - Rapid sequence induction (RSI) due to high risk of aspiration.
  - Thoracic epidural.
  - Arterial & central venous access, large bore IV access.
  - Lung isolation & lung protective ventilation.
  - Planning for repositioning.
  - Preparations for severe hemodynamic instability, especially during blunt mediastinal dissection.
  - Restrictive fluid strategy with vasopressors as needed to treat epidural-related vasoplegia.
##### Evidence-based Strategies
1. Avoiding large volumes of fluid.
2. Extubation in theatre.
3. Regional analgesia (Thoracic Epidural Analgesia > Paravertebral Block).
4. Lung protective ventilation.
##### Surgical Approach
- **Ivor Lewis**: Laparotomy, right thoracotomy.
- **Transhiatal**: Laparotomy, left neck.
- **Three-hole**: Laparotomy, thoracotomy, and cervical incision.
- **Left Thoracoabdominal**: Combined thoracic and abdominal incision.
- **Laparoscopic/Thoracoscopic**: Minimally invasive techniques.

##### Surgical Considerations
- Prolonged surgery.
- Need for one lung ventilation.
- Intraoperative repositioning.
- Hemodynamic instability: Intrathoracic dissection, supraventricular arrhythmias.
- No vascular access in left neck.
#### Postoperative
- Greatest mortality risk of all thoracic surgery.
- Attempt postoperative extubation and plan for high care stay.
- **Monitor for**
  - Aspiration pneumonia.
  - Respiratory failure.
  - Anastomotic dehiscence with empyema.
  - Mediastinitis.
  - Septic shock.
  - Arrhythmias.
  - Congestive heart failure (CHF).
##### Evidence-based Strategies
1. Adequate analgesia.
2. Reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents (NDMR).
3. Normothermia.
4. Haemodynamic stability.

# Oesophageal Injury

## Introduction
- **Causes**:
  - Spontaneous perforations, trauma, or iatrogenic perforations (60%).
  - Most common sites: Level of the cricopharyngeus and proximal to the lower oesophageal sphincter due to angulation of the hiatus and increased pathology such as oesophageal webs, rings, and strictures.

### Pathophysiology
- Oesophageal rupture allows food, gastric contents, secretions, and air to enter the mediastinum, leading to contamination, mediastinal emphysema, inflammation, and necrosis.
- Perforation of the overlying pleura allows oesophageal contents to enter the pleural space, causing pleural cavity contamination and pleural effusion, usually on the left.

### Time to Treatment
- Time from injury to treatment initiation is crucial:
  - Mortality with treatment delayed >24 hours: 27%.
  - Mortality with treatment <24 hours: 14%.

### Cause of Death
- Most common causes: Pneumothoraces, mediastinitis, and pleural effusions.

### Management of Acute Oesophageal Perforation

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - Clinical examination.
   - Fluid resuscitation.
   - Diagnostic imaging: CXR, CT, oesophagography, endoscopy.

2. **Leak Type Determination**:
   - **Contained or Limited Leak**:
	 - **Non-operative Management**:
	   - Medical management with monitoring.
	   - Minimally invasive interventions if deterioration occurs.
	 - **Operative Management**:
	   - Primary repair if suitable.
	   - Controlled fistula or resection if unsuitable for primary repair.

## Anaesthetic Considerations
- **Septic Shock**: Possible due to mediastinal contamination.
- **Aspiration Risk**: High; minimize coughing and straining to avoid worsening injury.
- **Cricoid Pressure**: Controversial.
- **Airway Management**:
  - Secure airway and place nasogastric tube in proximal oesophagus above the injury.
  - Surgeon will position the NG tube beyond the repaired oesophagus during surgery to keep the stomach decompressed.
  - NG tube not used for enteral nutrition; use jejunostomy instead.
- **Lung Isolation**: Required.
- **Normothermia**: Maintain using a forced air device and warmed IV fluids (goal-directed).

### Positioning
- Varies with pathology and surgical approach:
  - Lateral position for primary repair, thoracoscopy, or open thoracotomy.
  - Upper arm abducted for surgical access, avoid excessive stretch on brachial plexus.
  - Avoid corneal abrasions.
  - Frequent intraoperative repositioning may be needed, ensuring tube position is rechecked.

### Analgesia
- Thoracic epidural analgesia.
- Multimodal analgesia (MMA).
- Paravertebral block.

### Postoperative Management
- Includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitoring for sepsis.
- Evaluate for possible collections or leakage with ultrasound or CT.
- Gastrografin contrast study 2-3 weeks post-repair to check for ongoing leaks.
- If T-tube in place, perform contrast swallow to check for leaks before removal at 8-10 weeks post-operation.
