# Mechanisms of Action of Antihypertensive Drugs
## Blood Pressure Regulation

Blood pressure is regulated by the interaction between cardiac output and vascular resistance.

## Cardiac Output

- **Contractility**
	
	- Influenced by the Central Nervous System (CNS).
- **Heart Rate**
	
	- Influenced by the CNS.
	- Modulated by β-blockers.
- **Preload**
	
	- Influenced by diuretics through the kidneys' salt/water balance.
	- Modulated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS).
	- Controlled by ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, and renin antagonists.
## Vascular Resistance

- **Arterial/Venous Vasodilatation**
	- Affects vascular smooth muscle tone.
	- Modulated by:
		- Calcium channel blockers.
		- Alpha blockers.
		- Vasodilators.
### Central Influence

- **Centrally Acting Agents**
	- Affect the CNS, thereby influencing heart rate and contractility.
**Note:** There is considerable overlap in the actions of different antihypertensive drug classes. For instance, thiazide and loop diuretics induce both vasodilatation and diuresis.

# Classes and Subclasses of Antihypertensive Medications with Common Examples
- Current NICE guidance recommends that patients under the age of 55 be initiated on drugs which target the RAS as first-line therapy.
- Patients aged over 55 and black people of African or Caribbean family origin are initially treated with drugs which act through non-RAS mechanisms, as these latter patient groups typically have low-renin hypertension

## Targeting Renin–Angiotensin System
- **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors:**
  - Captopril, lisinopril, ramipril
- **Angiotensin receptor antagonists:**
  - Candesartan, losartan, valsartan
- **Direct renin antagonists:**
  - Aliskiren
### Mechanism of Action
- Three drug classes directly target points of the RAS pathway.
- They act to reduce production of the peptide hormone angiotensin II, or reduce its receptor binding.
- Angiotensin II has high affinity for AT1 G-protein-coupled receptors, activation of which causes increased arteriolar tone and SVR.
- It also causes sympathetic nervous system activation, increased pituitary secretion of antidiuretic and adrenocorticotrophic hormones, and increased adrenocortical secretion of aldosterone.
- By antagonizing the RAS pathway, SVR and arterial pressure are reduced. This effect is potentiated by a reduction in aldosterone secretion with resultant reduction in renal sodium and water retention. Negative feedback results in increased renin release by the juxtaglomerular apparatus.
#### RAAS System

The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. Various drugs target different components of this system to exert their antihypertensive effects.

#### Pathway

1. **Liver**
	
	- Produces **angiotensinogen**.
2. **Kidney**
	
	- Releases **renin**, which converts angiotensinogen to **angiotensin I**.
	- Renin activity can be inhibited by **renin antagonists**.
3. **Lungs (ACE)**
	
	- **Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)** in the lungs converts angiotensin I to **angiotensin II**.
	- ACE also breaks down bradykinin into inactive metabolites.
	- **ACE inhibitors (ACEIs)** prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.
4. **Angiotensin II**

	- Acts on the **adrenal cortex** to stimulate the release of **aldosterone**.
	- This increases sodium and water retention, raising blood pressure.
	- **Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** inhibit the action of angiotensin II.
5. **Adrenal Cortex**

	- Releases aldosterone in response to angiotensin II.
	- Aldosterone increases reabsorption of sodium and water in the kidneys.
	- The increased blood volume provides a negative feedback mechanism to the kidneys, reducing renin release.
### ACE-I

#### Pharmacodynamics
- **Cardiovascular:** ↓ Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) → ↓ Blood pressure (BP), heart rate unchanged.
- **Renal:** ↓ Renal perfusion → ↑ Urea, Creatinine → Potential renal failure.
- **Metabolic:** ↑ Renin → ↑ Angiotensin I; Hyperkalemia.
- **Miscellaneous:** Cough, rash, pruritus.
- **Interactions:** Diuretics, NSAIDs, Propofol, Nitrates, Lithium.
#### Pharmocokinetics
- **Absorption:** 60%.
- **Prodrug:** Converted to active enalaprilat in liver and kidney.
- **Excretion:** Renal.
#### Indications
- Primary hypertension (first-line for patients <55 years).
- Heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease.
#### Contraindications
- Pregnancy (risk of birth defects).
- Renal artery stenosis.
#### Mechanism of Action (MOA)
- Inhibits ACE: Blocks conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II → ↓ Vasopressor effects → ↓ BP.
- Reduces Angiotensin II, accumulates bradykinin (vasodilatation, but may cause dry cough).
#### Side Effects

- Increased cough.
- Renal impairment: ACEIs can reduce renal perfusion, risk in renal artery stenosis.
- Hyperkalemia, agranulocytosis, skin rashes, taste disturbance.
- Intraoperative hypotension.
- Rare: Angioedema.
#### Recommendations for General Anesthesia

- Discontinue 12 hours prior to surgery to avoid hypotension.
- Use vasopressin or methylene blue if necessary.
- No high-level evidence of worse outcomes if taken on the day of surgery.
#### Interactions

- **NSAIDs:** May precipitate renal dysfunction, reduce efficacy of ACEIs.
- **Propofol, Lithium, Nitrates:** Accumulation risk in renal excretion.
- **Diuretics:** May cause hypovolemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia with potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics.
### Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists (ARA)

#### Introduction

- ARAs have therapeutic effects similar to ACEIs but with reduced risk of new onset diabetes, stroke, progression of cardiac failure, and all-cause mortality in chronic kidney disease patients.
#### Mechanism of Action (MOA)

- **Action:** Target AT1 G-protein-coupled receptors, antagonizing angiotensin II.
- **Binding:** Candesartan and telmisartan bind irreversibly; losartan and valsartan are competitive antagonists.
- **Advantages:**
	- Effective even when angiotensin II is produced via non-ACE pathways (e.g., chymase in kidney tissue).
	- Do not inhibit bradykinin metabolism, reducing the incidence of cough.
	- Lower risk of angioedema compared to ACEIs.
#### Anaesthesia Considerations
- Increased risk of hypotension post-induction, especially when combined with diuretics, similar to ACEIs.
### Renin Inhibitors

#### Introduction

- **Aliskiren**: A piperidine derivative, is the only available renin inhibitor. It is used by specialists for patients unresponsive to or intolerant of other antihypertensives.
- **Mechanism**: Directly inhibits renin, reducing the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, acting upstream of ACEIs and ARAs without causing bradykinin accumulation.
- **Side Effects**: Potential for renal dysfunction and electrolyte disturbances similar to ACEIs and ARAs. Specific side-effect: diarrhea at higher doses.
#### Anaesthesia Considerations

- Limited evidence on aliskiren's impact during anaesthesia, but case reports indicate potential for prolonged and refractory hypotension post-induction.
#### Perioperative Use of RAS-Blocking Drugs

- No universal guidelines exist for perioperative withholding of RAS blockers.
- Many departments recommend withholding ACEIs and ARAs on the day of surgery to reduce hypotension risk. However, the decision should balance the potential benefits of continuing these drugs, such as renal protection and reduced perioperative atrial fibrillation. Maintaining euvolaemia and managing hypotension with volume expansion and vasopressors is crucial if continuing RAS antagonists perioperatively.
## Adrenoceptor Antagonists
- **β-Blockers:**
  - Atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol
- **α-Blockers:**
  - Doxazosin, labetalol (also a β-blocker), phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine
### Beta Blockers

- β-Blockers are not used as first-line antihypertensives unless there are other indications, for example, after myocardial infarction,orintachyarrhythmiassuchasatrialfibrillation. Their diverse indications include stable heart failure, thyrotoxicosis, oesophageal varices, anxiety, and glaucoma
#### Classification
- β-Blockers are categorized according to cardioselectivity.
	- Metoprolol, esmolol, and atenolol have greater affinity for β1 receptors than β2 at therapeutic doses (selectivity is reduced at higher doses).
	- This contrasts with non-cardioselective drugs such as propranolol and sotalol.
	- Most β-blockers are pure antagonists; however, some drugs are partial antagonists at β receptors and exhibit some agonist/sympathetomimetic activity (pindolol, timolol).
	- The clinical relevance of this is uncertain.
	- Some βblockers (propranolol, metoprolol) block sodium channels and have membrane stabilizing activity, that is, may be classed as Vaughan-Williams class 1 antiarrhythmics.
	- Labetalol is a β-blocker which also has α-blocking activity. In addition to their antihypertensive effects, β-blockers improve the myocardial oxygen supply:demand ratio and help reduce myocardial ischaemia by prolonging the period of diastole.
#### MOA and Side-effects of Beta-blockers

[Beta-blockers_Calgary guide](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Beta-Blockers-Mechanism-of-Action-and-Side-Effects/)

##### Types

- **Cardio-Selective:** Primarily bind beta-1 receptors.
##### Mechanism of Action

- **Beta-2 Receptor Antagonism:**
	- **Throughout Body Tissue:** ↓ cAMP → ↓ Na⁺/K⁺ pump activity → Hyperkalemia.
	- **Lungs:** Bronchoconstriction → Wheezing, dyspnea.
	- **Eyes:** Reduced intraocular pressure.
	- **CNS:** ↓ Tremor, anxiety; Hypoglycemia unawareness.

	- **Kidneys:** ↓ Renin release → ↓ Angiotensin II and aldosterone, ↓ Na⁺/H₂O reabsorption → ↑ Urinary Na⁺/H₂O loss → ↓ Total blood volume.
	- **Baroreceptors:** Lowered set point.
	- **Noradrenaline:** Inhibition from presynaptic β₂ receptor blockade.
##### Clinical Considerations

### Classification

| Classification         | Name               | Example          | Mechanism of Action (MOA)                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **I**                  | Phenylalkylamines  | Verapamil        | - L-isomer: Ca²⁺ blockade at SA and AV Node <br> - D-isomer: Na⁺ blockade → LA Activity    |
| **II**                 | Dihydropyridines   | Nifedipine, Amlodipine, Nimodipine | Stabilizes vascular L-Type Ca²⁺ in inactive formation → ↓ Ca²⁺ influx                       |
| **III**                | Benzothiazepines   | Diltiazem        | Ca²⁺ deformation → ↓ Ca²⁺ influx                                                            |

- **Phenylalkylamines**: Verapamil blocks calcium at the SA and AV nodes, and its D-isomer blocks sodium affecting LA activity.
- **Dihydropyridines**: These drugs, like Nifedipine, Amlodipine, and Nimodipine, stabilize vascular L-type calcium channels in their inactive form, reducing calcium influx.
- **Benzothiazepines**: Diltiazem deforms calcium channels, decreasing calcium influx.
### Mechanism of Action (MOA)
- **Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)** act on L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, myocardial, and nodal tissues.
- **Affinity Variation**: Determines specific effects:
	- **Cardiac Tissue (e.g., Diltiazem, Verapamil)**: Cause negative chronotropy and inotropy.
	- **Vascular Smooth Muscle**: Cause peripheral vasodilatation and reduced systemic vascular resistance (SVR), possibly leading to reflex cardiac stimulation.
### Side Effects
- **Cardiovascular**: Reflex tachycardia, potential myocardial ischemia, peripheral microcirculation disturbance (swelling, flushing, headache).
- **Rate-Limiting Agents**: Prolong AV conduction, causing bradycardia and potentially worsening heart failure.
### Perioperative Use
- Little evidence supports commencing or continuing CCBs perioperatively for reducing myocardial infarction or death risk.
- Continuing CCBs with β-blockers may increase hypotension incidence under anesthesia but generally not recommended to withhold CCBs before surgery.
