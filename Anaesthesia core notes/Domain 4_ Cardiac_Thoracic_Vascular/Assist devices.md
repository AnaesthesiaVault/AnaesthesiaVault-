# Anaesthesia Considerations for LVADs/VADs

## Types
1. **1st Generation**: Pulsatile (large, clumsy, noisy)
2. **2nd Generation**: Small, impeller/rotator, smaller
## Preoperative Evaluation

The clinical status of an LVAD-supported patient depends on:

- Extent of end-organ damage from low-output states before VAD implantation
- Post-implantation complications
- Present surgical problem

## Anaesthetic Considerations and Goals

## VAD-Specific Considerations
- VADs do not operate on the Starling curve and only pump the volume delivered to them. Factors that decrease preload will affect pump flow and decrease output, such as drugs, dehydration, hemorrhage, lateral decubitus, increased abdominal pressures (insufflation), and bed position.
## Cardiac Arrest
- Similar to normal with ACLS principles, except:
  - **Cardioversion**: Do not place pads directly over the device
  - **Compressions**: Evaluate in the moment (dislodgement of cannula may cause certain death)
## Postoperative Analgesia
- Avoid hypertension/tachycardia to prevent increased afterload and ensure the patient is not too sedated to prevent pulmonary hypertension and decreased preload.
## Goals
- Full preload, reduced pulmonary pressures, not fast, forward (reduce afterload)
- Multidisciplinary approach
- Monitor battery, anticoagulation, and other critical factors
