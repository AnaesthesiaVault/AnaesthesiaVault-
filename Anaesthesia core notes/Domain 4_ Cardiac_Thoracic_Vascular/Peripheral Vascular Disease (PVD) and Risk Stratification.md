# Anaesthesia for Peripheral Vascular Disease

## Introduction

- **Incidence**: Approximately 20% in individuals over 60 years in Europe and America.
- **Affected Areas**: Lower limb >> cerebral > renal > mesenteric circulations.
- **Cause**: Predominantly atherosclerosis, a chronic systemic inflammatory disease affecting all circulations.
- **Co-prevalence with CAD**: High; clinical history and ECG detect only 20-40% of coexisting CAD, while cardiac catheterisation detects CAD in up to 90% of PVD patients.
- **Mortality Risk**: Patients have a fivefold greater risk of cardiovascular (CV) mortality and a threefold greater risk of all-cause mortality.

## Risk Stratification

### Level of Procedural Risk of Different Vascular Interventions

#### High Risk (> 5% MACE)

- Open thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs
- Infrainguinal bypass
- Open renal or mesenteric artery reconstruction

#### Intermediate Risk (1% to 5% MACE)

- Percutaneous procedures (e.g., endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, renal or mesenteric artery stenting)
- Carotid artery stenting or endarterectomy
- Amputations of major extremities

#### Low Risk (< 1% MACE)

- Arteriovenous fistula formation
- Superficial venous procedures
- Digital amputations
- **Guidelines**: AHA/ACC guidelines and Lee’s Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI).
- **Limitations of RCRI**: Performs well in excluding low-risk patients but less so in predicting events in intermediate and high-risk patients, especially in vascular non-cardiac surgery.
- **Emerging Biomarkers**: BNP/ProBNP and Troponins for improved risk stratification.

### ProBNP

- **Secretion**: By ventricular myocytes in response to increased wall stress from volume or pressure load or ischaemia.
- **Evidence**: Elevated preoperative BNP/ProBNP associated with major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and higher mortality.
- **Risk Prediction**: Better than traditional clinical predictors; improves risk discrimination when used with RCRI.
- **Thresholds**: Variability in BNP/ProBNP thresholds reported in studies; ongoing VISION study aims to provide more precise thresholds.

### Troponin T (Trop-T)

- **Mechanism**: Released due to myocardial necrosis, pivotal in diagnosing acute coronary syndromes (ACS).
- **Non-Surgical Setting**: Elevated troponins predict poor outcome and mortality.
- **Surgical Setting**: Elevated high-sensitive Troponin T (Tnt) post-surgery predicts 30-day mortality.
- **Mortality Rates**: Vary with troponin levels; even low elevations associated with increased mortality.
- **Monitoring**: Recommended for patients with multiple risk factors and those undergoing high-risk surgery.
- **Interventions**: Ongoing research on effective interventions for troponin-positive patients; includes aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, and intensive surveillance.
### South African Preoperative and Postoperative Cardiovascular Risk Management for Elective Non-Cardiac Surgery (2021)

#### 1. Patient Selection for Preoperative Risk Stratification
- **Recommendation:** For elective non-cardiac surgical patients aged 45 years or older with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive cardiac failure, stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), or for vascular surgical patients aged 18 years or older with peripheral vascular disease, preoperative risk stratification is recommended.
	- **Justification:** These patients have a predicted 30-day major adverse cardiac event (MACE) risk exceeding 5%.
	- **Strength of Recommendation:** Conditional.
	- **Evidence Quality:** Moderate.
	
#### 2. Routine Non-Invasive Testing for Cardiovascular Risk
- **Recommendation:** Routine non-invasive testing for cardiovascular risk stratification prior to elective non-cardiac surgery is not recommended for adults.
	- **Strength of Recommendation:** Strong.
	- **Evidence Quality:** Low-to-moderate.
	
#### 3. Preoperative Natriuretic Peptide (NP) Screening
- **Recommendation:** Preoperative NP screening is recommended for:
	- Patients aged 45 years or older with a history of coronary artery disease, stroke, TIA, or congestive cardiac failure.
	- Vascular surgical patients aged 18 years or older with peripheral vascular disease.
	- **Strength of Recommendation:** Strong.
	- **Evidence Quality:** High.

#### 4. Postoperative Troponin Monitoring
- **Recommendation:** Daily postoperative troponin measurements for 48-72 hours are recommended for non-cardiac surgical patients who:
	- Are aged 45 years or older with a history of coronary artery disease, stroke, TIA, or congestive cardiac failure.
	- Vascular surgical patients aged 18 years or older with peripheral vascular disease.
	- **Criteria:**
		1. Baseline risk >5% for MACE 30 days after elective surgery (if no preoperative NP screening was conducted).
		2. Elevated preoperative BNP (>99 pg/mL) or NT-proBNP (>300 pg/mL).
	- **Strength of Recommendation:** Conditional.
	- **Evidence Quality:** Moderate.
### Perioperative Risk Assessment and Monitoring Algorithm (SA 2021)

**1. Perioperative Risk Assessment**
- Target Population:
	- Patients aged ≥45 years with a history of:
		- Coronary artery disease.
		- Stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).
		- Congestive cardiac failure.
	- Patients aged ≥18 years undergoing vascular surgery.
- Procedure: Elective non-cardiac surgery.

**2. Decision Point: Is NP (Natriuretic Peptide) Testing Available?**
- **If NP Testing is Not Available:**
	- Proceed to **Postoperative Troponin Monitoring**.
- **If NP Testing is Available:**
	- Perform NP testing to measure:
		- BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) levels.
		- NT-proBNP (N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide) levels.

**3. NP Test Results Interpretation**
- **NP Abnormal:**
	- BNP > 99 pg/mL or NT-proBNP > 300 pg/mL.
	- **Action:** Proceed to **Postoperative Troponin Monitoring**.
- **NP Normal:**
	- **Action:** No further intervention is required.
### Summary of the ACC/AHA, ESC/ESA, and CCS Recommendations on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Management of Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery

#### Electrocardiogram

- **ACC/AHA**: If undergoing intermediate to high-risk surgery and with coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, or structural heart disease.
- **ESC/ESA**: If undergoing high-risk surgery.
- **CCS**: No recommendation.

#### Resting Echocardiogram

- **ACC/AHA**: Obtain if undergoing intermediate to high-risk surgery and with decompensated heart failure, valvular disease, structural heart disease, or dyspnea of unclear etiology.
- **ESC/ESA**: May be considered if undergoing high-risk surgery.
- **CCS**: Do not obtain unless severe valvular disease, pulmonary hypertension, or an undiagnosed cardiomyopathy is present.

#### Stress Testing

- **ACC/AHA**:
	- Low risk of MACE (< 1%): Do not obtain.
	- Elevated risk of MACE (≥ 1%) based on METs:
		- < 4 METs: Obtain.
		- 4-10 METs: Reasonable to forgo.
		- > 10 METs: Forgo.
			
- **ESC/ESA**:
	- High-risk surgery:
		- < 4 METs and have at least one clinical risk factor (ischemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke/transient ischemic attack, renal dysfunction, or insulin-dependent diabetes).
- **CCS**: Do not obtain.

#### Coronary Angiography

- **ACC/AHA**:
	- Routine coronary angiography not recommended.
	- Coronary angiography and revascularization indicated for acute coronary syndrome.
- **ESC/ESA**: Same as ACC/AHA.
- **CCS**: Coronary angiography and revascularization indicated for acute coronary syndrome.

## Anaesthetic and Postoperative Management in Peripheral Vascular Surgery

|Operation|Anesthetic|Monitoring|Postoperative Analgesia|
|---|---|---|---|
|Aortobifemoral bypass graft|General Anesthesia (GA) (IPPV via ETT) _plus_ thoracic epidural|Routine plus A-line and CV-line; consider CO monitor|Epidural for 2–3 days, then PCA opioid, then oral analgesia|
|Axillofemoral bypass graft|GA (IPPV via ETT)|Routine|PCA or oral opioid|
|Femoro-femoral / Femoro-popliteal / Femoro-distal bypass grafts / Femoral endarterectomy|Regional (lumbar epidural; CSE; spinal) _plus_ sedation or GA (IPPV via ETT, or spontaneous ventilation via LMA)|Routine (A-line and/or CV-line not usually required unless specific patient features present)|Oral opioid (consider epidural infusion of LA for selected patients)|
|Balloon embolectomy|LA infiltration by surgeon _plus_ intravenous sedation/analgesia from anesthetist|Routine|Simple oral analgesia ± oral opioid|

## Preoperative Evaluation
### Risk Stratify
### Pharmacotherapy Prior to Major Vascular Surgery

#### Beta-Blockers

1. Should not be started de novo in low-risk patients.
2. If chronically on beta-blocker therapy, continue if no contraindications.
3. If multiple RCRI risk factors, high-risk myocardial ischemia, or heart failure, can consider starting a beta-blocker. If started, should be started at least 7 days prior to operative intervention.

#### ACEI/ARB

1. Should not be started de novo.
2. If chronically on ACEI/ARB therapy, continue if no contraindications. If discontinued, should be restarted soon in the postoperative setting when feasible.
3. If heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, reasonable to start prior to operative intervention. If started, should be started at least 7 days prior.

#### Statins

1. Continue on home statin or start on statin prior to operative intervention.

#### Antiplatelets

1. If no prior PCI, there is no benefit to starting aspirin prior to major vascular, noncardiac surgery.
2. Start low-dose aspirin prior to CEA and continue in the postoperative period.
3. If prior PCI and patient is on single antiplatelet therapy chronically, continue single antiplatelet therapy.
4. If prior PCI and within 1 month of BMS or 6 months of DES, should continue DAPT.

#### Anticoagulants

1. VKA should be held 3–5 days prior to major vascular surgery, for an INR ≤ 1.5 prior to operative intervention.
2. Apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran (with CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min) should be withheld 2 days prior to intervention and resumed 2–3 days following intervention. Dabigatran (with CrCl < 50 mL/min) should be withheld for 4 days prior to intervention.
3. No bridging is required for atrial fibrillation alone.
4. For mechanical heart valves, if a current generation mechanical aortic valve (e.g., On-X bileaflet valve) alone without thromboembolic risk factors (i.e., atrial fibrillation, previous thromboembolism, hypercoagulable state, left ventricular systolic dysfunction), bridging anticoagulation may be deferred. All other mechanical heart valves or if thromboembolic risk factors should be bridged with low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin.

#### Novel Diabetic Agents

1. GLP-1 analogues and SGLT2 inhibitors should be withheld prior to operative intervention.

### Optimization
#### Treatment Goals for Modifiable Risk Factors in Patients with Diabetes and Peripheral Vascular Disease

|Risk Factor|Target|
|---|---|
|Glycemic control|HbA1C < 7% (ADA) or < 6.5% (EASD) in patients without cardiovascular disease; HbA1C 7–7.5% in patients with cardiovascular disease or life expectancy < 10 years|
|LDL-cholesterol|< 1.8 mmol/L|
|Smoking|Complete nicotine cessation|
|Arterial pressure|< 130/80 mmHg|
|Anti-platelets|Aspirin or clopidogrel|
