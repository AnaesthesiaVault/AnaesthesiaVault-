# Risk Assessment

## Perioperative Risk Assessment and Monitoring Algorithm (SA 2021)

**1. Perioperative Risk Assessment**
- Target Population:
	- Patients aged ≥45 years with a history of:
		- Coronary artery disease.
		- Stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).
		- Congestive cardiac failure.
	- Patients aged ≥18 years undergoing vascular surgery.
- Procedure: Elective non-cardiac surgery.

**2. Decision Point: Is NP (Natriuretic Peptide) Testing Available?**
- **If NP Testing is Not Available:**
	- Proceed to **Postoperative Troponin Monitoring**.
- **If NP Testing is Available:**
	- Perform NP testing to measure:
		- BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) levels.
		- NT-proBNP (N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide) levels.

**3. NP Test Results Interpretation**
- **NP Abnormal:**
	- BNP > 99 pg/mL or NT-proBNP > 300 pg/mL.
	- **Action:** Proceed to **Postoperative Troponin Monitoring**.
- **NP Normal:**
	- **Action:** No further intervention is required.

## Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)
- **Pro**: Most validated, moderate discrimination
- **Con**: Some risks missing (AS, PH)

## National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP)
- **Pro**: Better discrimination
- **Con**: No external validation, likely underestimates risk (did not measure troponin leak)

## Functional Capacity
- METS (self-reported) do not predict perioperative cardiac risk (shown in multiple studies)
- DASI <34 = predicts increased 30-day mortality, MINS, and MI

## Cardiac Biomarker
- **NT-proBNP**: Able to predict patients at low risk of MACE

| Test Result                           | Risk Estimate (%) | 95% CI for the Risk Estimate |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| NT-proBNP < 300 ng/L or BNP < 92 mg/L | 4.9               | 3.9%-6.1%                    |
| NT-proBNP ≥ 300 ng/L or BNP ≥ 92 mg/L | 21.8              | 19.0%-24.8%                  |

- CCS guidelines: Perform Pro BNP on high-risk patients (>5% risk of MACE post-op):
  - Older than 65 years
  - RCRI>1
  - Age 45-65 with CVS disease

## Resting Echo
- CCS guidelines: Not for routine use (no benefit in addition to BNP & RCRI)
- Use if patient may have:
  - AS/MS
  - HOCM
  - Severe PH

## Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography (CCTA)
- Overestimates
- CCS guidelines suggest against use

## Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET)
- Weak predictor for long-term post-op mortality
- Cost ineffective and inconvenient for patients
- CCS guidelines evaluated against CPET for risk stratification, whereas AHA/ACC use it if METS<4 and it will influence care or decision making (can be used in risk prediction scores)

## Pharmacological Stress Testing
- Poor quality evidence
- Not currently advised by CCS, AHA/ACC suggest use if unable to conduct CPET
## Surgical risk and Timing

| Category                              | Surgical Procedures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low Surgical Risk (<1%)**           | - Breast<br>- Dental<br>- Endocrine: thyroid<br>- Eye<br>- Gynaecological: minor<br>- Orthopaedic minor (meniscectomy)<br>- Reconstructive<br>- Superficial surgery<br>- Urological minor (transurethral resection of the prostate)<br>- VATS minor lung resection                                                                                                                                                |

| **High Surgical Risk (>5%)**          | - Adrenal resection<br>- Aortic and major vascular surgery<br>- Carotid symptomatic (CAS)<br>- Duodenal-pancreatic surgery<br>- Liver resection, bile duct surgery<br>- Oesophagectomy<br>- Open lower limb revascularization for acute limb ischaemia or amputation<br>- Pneumonectomy (VATS or open surgery)<br>- Pulmonary or liver transplant<br>- Repair of perforated bowel<br>- Total cystectomy           |

### Timing Categories
- **Immediate**: Surgery/intervention should be performed without any delay to save life or organ function.
- **Urgent**: Surgery/intervention should be performed without unnecessary delay to save life, limb, or organ function.
- **Time-sensitive**: Surgery/intervention should be performed as soon as possible as there is a time-dependent risk of losing limb or organ function, or increased risk of complications. Cancer surgery is typically time-sensitive, as is carotid surgery to prevent stroke in a symptomatic case. The time window for time-sensitive surgery will vary depending on the underlying disease.
- **Elective**: Surgery/intervention can be performed electively (not further defined) without significant risk of losing limb, organ function, or increased risks of complications.

# Conduct of Anaesthesia
## Pre-op Evaluation

### Focused History and Cardiovascular Physical Examination

#### Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) Risk Factors
- Estimate risk
- 6-component Revised Cardiac Risk Index (one point for each)
  - 0 (0.4%); 3 or more (10%)
	- IHD
	- CVD
	- HF
	- CKD (serum creatinine level ≥2.0 mg/dL)
	- IDDM
	- High-risk surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or vascular)

#### Factors That Increase Risk 3x Fold
- CKD
- DM

#### Functional Assessment
- Ask patients whether they can perform workloads of 4 or greater metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) without symptomatic limitation.
  - Walking up a hill or climbing up 2 or more flights of stairs
	- If unable: 2-fold increased risk of perioperative cardiovascular complications compared with those who are able (9.6% vs 5.2%)
  - Self-reported exercise tolerance does not correlate with CPET outputs (peak oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold), and self-reported METS < 4 had a sensitivity of only 19.4%)
  - DASI scores were predictive of the primary outcome
	- The DASI combines 12 questions and provides a score, which is then calculated as a metabolic equivalent
	- A higher score indicates greater functional capacity
	- DASI <34 = predicts increased 30-day mortality, MINS, and MI

#### Symptoms and Signs of Concern
- Exertional chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, recent syncope, and physical examination findings, such as murmurs (any diastolic or grade ≥3/6 systolic), gallops, jugular venous distention, or edema, may indicate cardiovascular disease.

#### Type of Surgery Risk Assessment for MACE
- Low risk (<1%): Cataract surgery and many types of cosmetic or plastic surgery.
- High risk: Vascular (7.7%), thoracic (6.5%), transplant (6.2%), and general (3.9%)
  - Use of minimally invasive, laparoscopic, and endovascular techniques may attenuate cardiovascular risk

### Frailty
- In patients aged ≥70 years, being scheduled to undergo intermediateor high-risk NCS, frailty screening should be performed.

### Contraindications to Elective Noncardiac Surgery
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Acute decompensated heart failure
- Tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias associated with hypotension or requiring urgent medical attention (e.g., ventricular tachycardia or high-grade atrioventricular block)
- Symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (mean gradient >40 mm Hg or peak velocity >4 m/s)

### Perioperative Drug Management

![](Pasted%20image%2020240615162100.png)

## Investigations

### ECG
- Preoperative ST-segment depressions greater than 0.5 mm are associated with increased risk of postoperative death or myocardial infarction (11.2%)
- Little benefit prior to low-risk surgery such as cataract surgery and cosmetic or plastic surgery
- Indications:
  - Risk factor(s) and are scheduled for intermediateor high-risk surgery
  - Known CVD or CV risk factors (including age ≥65 years), or symptoms or signs suggestive of CVD

### Echocardiography
- Any degree of systolic dysfunction, moderate to severe left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, or an aortic gradient of 20 mm Hg or greater was 80% sensitive for perioperative cardiac events and had a negative predictive value of 97%
- Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30% was associated with a greater risk of perioperative death, myocardial infarction, and heart failure exacerbation (53.6% vs 26.0% with left ventricular ejection fraction >30%)
- Indications according to surgical risk:
  - **All risk surgery**:
	- New murmur and symptoms
	- Dyspnoea and/or peripheral oedema and elevated NT-proBNP/BNP
	- Family history of genetic cardiomyopathy,
  - **Intermediate risk**:
	- Poor functional capacity, abnormal ECG, high NT-proBNP/BNP, or ≥1 clinical risk factor
	- Suspected new CVD or unexplained signs or symptoms
  - **High risk surgery**:
	- Newly detected murmur suggesting clinically significant pathology
	- Poor functional capacity, and/or high NT-proBNP/BNP, or if murmurs are detected
	- TTE should be considered in patients with suspected new CVD or unexplained signs or symptoms
  - **SA guideline**:
	- Resting echocardiography is not recommended unless there is a clinical suspicion of intracardiac lesion (mitral or aortic stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) or severe pulmonary hypertension.
### Pro BNP
- Preoperative BNP levels greater than 92 pg/mL or NT-ProBNP levels greater than 300 pg/mL were associated with increased risk of MACE (21%)
  - Less than 100 pg/mL: 0.3%
  - 100 and 200 pg/mL: 0.7%
  - 200 and 1500 pg/mL: 1.4%
  - Greater than 1500 pg/mL: 4.0%
- Indications:
  - Canadian guidelines recommend measurement of NT-proBNP or BNP levels prior to noncardiac surgery in patients with cardiovascular disease, a Revised Cardiac Risk Index of 1 or greater, or for those who are aged 65 years or older
  - Dyspnoea and/or peripheral oedema, unless there is a certain non-cardiac explanation.
  - Known CVD, CV risk factors (including age ≥65 years), or symptoms suggestive of CVD, it should be considered to measure BNP or NT-proBNP

### Troponin
- Should be measured perioperatively when signs or symptoms suggest myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction
- Indications:
  - Canadian guidelines recommend postoperative cardiac troponin surveillance in high-risk individuals
  - High-risk patients, both before and 48–72 h after major surgery, may be considered
	- CVD, CV risk factors (including age ≥65 years), or symptoms suggestive of CVD, it is recommended to measure hs-cTn T or hs-cTn I

### Haemoglobin and Bleeding
- In patients scheduled for intermediateto high-risk NCS.
- Treat anaemia in advance of NCS
- Expected blood loss of ≥500 mL, use washed cell salvage.
- Point-of-care diagnostics for guidance of blood component therapy
- In patients undergoing NCS and experiencing major bleeding, administration of tranexamic acid should be immediately considered

### HBA1C
- If not performed in the previous 3 months.
- In case of HbA1c ≥8.5% (≥69 mmol/mol), elective NCS should be postponed, if safe and practical.

### Stress Imaging
- Stress imaging should be considered before high-risk NCS in asymptomatic patients with poor functional capacity, and previous PCI or CABG.
- Routine cardiac stress testing is not indicated for low-risk patients or for high-risk patients who are able to walk up a hill or climb up 2 or more flights of stairs without difficulty

### Coronary Angiography
- CCTA should be considered to rule out CAD in patients with suspected CCS or biomarker-negative NSTE-ACS in case of low-to-intermediate clinical likelihood of CAD, or in patients unsuitable for non-invasive functional testing undergoing non-urgent, intermediate-, and high-risk NCS

## Perioperative Risk Assessment and Management of Patients with a Coronary Stent

### 1. Assess and Integrate All Risk Considerations

![](Pasted%20image%2020240701171841.png)

[View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.](https://whimsical.com/considerations-BdXSrxj8txTD8EkCXw3y2h?ref=chatgpt)

### 2. Determine Appropriate Delay to Surgery

### 3. Discontinue P2Y12 Inhibitors 5-7 Days Before Major Non-Cardiac Surgery

### 4. Continue 81 mg/d of Aspirin Unless Surgical Bleeding Risks Are Prohibitive

### 5. Optimize Perioperative Lipid-Lowering Therapy

### 6. Avoid Perioperative Hemodynamic Perturbations (Hypotension, Hypertension, Tachycardia)

### Management Recommendations

1. Assess all risk factors comprehensively.
2. Delay surgery appropriately.
3. Discontinue P2Y12 inhibitors 5-7 days before major non-cardiac surgery.
4. Continue low-dose aspirin unless bleeding risks are prohibitive.
5. Optimize lipid-lowering therapy.
6. Avoid perioperative hemodynamic disturbances (hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia).
#### How Soon After Coronary Stent Implantation May a Patient Safely Undergo Noncardiac Surgery?

- Individuals who require surgery within 1 year after percutaneous coronary intervention are at increased risk of perioperative events compared with those without coronary stents.
- Ischemic risks are inversely related to the time interval between stent placement and noncardiac surgery.
- Patients who undergo coronary stent placement should have surgery delayed until the risks associated with delaying surgery outweigh the risks of thrombosis that are associated with cessation of dual antiplatelet therapy.
- Elective noncardiac surgery should be delayed for at least 30 days after bare metal stent implantation and 12 months after drug-eluting stent placement, although more recent evidence suggests that a delay of 3 to 6 months may be safe.
# SA Perioperative Guideline Summary

## Recommendations

1. **Patient Selection for Further Preoperative Risk Stratification:**
   - Elective non-cardiac surgical patients who are 45 years and older with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive cardiac failure, stroke or transient ischemic attack.
   - Vascular surgical patients 18 years or older with peripheral vascular disease.
   - These patients require further preoperative risk stratification as their predicted 30-day major adverse cardiac event (MACE) risk exceeds 5% (conditional recommendation: moderate-quality evidence).

2. **Routine Non-Invasive Testing:**
   - Routine non-invasive testing for cardiovascular risk stratification prior to elective non-cardiac surgery in adults is not recommended (strong recommendation: low-to-moderate-quality evidence).

3. **Preoperative Natriuretic Peptide (NP) Screening:**
   - Elective non-cardiac surgical patients who are 45 years and older with a history of coronary artery disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or congestive cardiac failure.
   - Vascular surgical patients 18 years or older with peripheral vascular disease should have preoperative NP screening (strong recommendation: high-quality evidence).

4. **Postoperative Troponin Measurements:**
   - Daily postoperative troponin measurements for 48-72 hours for non-cardiac surgical patients who are 45 years and older with a history of coronary artery disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, congestive cardiac failure, or vascular surgical patients 18 years or older with peripheral vascular disease.
   - This is indicated if:
	 - Baseline risk >5% for MACE 30 days after elective surgery (if no preoperative NP screening).
	 - Elevated BNP >99 pg/mL or NT-proBNP >300 pg/mL before elective surgery (conditional recommendation: moderate-quality evidence).

## Role of Non-Invasive Testing

### Self-Reported Functional Capacity
- Patient-reported ability to exercise is an inaccurate and biased measure of physical fitness.

### Resting Echocardiography, Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography, Pharmacological Stress Echocardiography, and Radionuclide Imaging
- Not recommended for cardiovascular risk assessment.
- Resting echocardiography is inferior to cardiac biomarkers.
- Resting echocardiography is only recommended if there is clinical suspicion of intracardiac lesion (mitral or aortic stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) or severe pulmonary hypertension.
- Coronary computed tomographic angiography overestimates risk and leads to unnecessary cardiac intervention (strong recommendation: moderate-quality evidence).

### Exercise Stress Testing and Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing
- Current evidence does not support their use for cardiovascular risk assessment.

### The Role of Natriuretic Peptide Testing in Risk Stratification
- NP testing is a good predictor of perioperative adverse cardiac events and superior to the RCRI.
- BNP >99 pg/mL and NT-proBNP >300 pg/mL are predictive of >5% risk of MACE.
- Refer to Recommendation 3.

### Preoperative NP Thresholds for Predicting 30-Day Mortality and Non-Fatal Myocardial Infarction

| Type of Surgery            | Type of NP  | NP Level (pg/mL) | MACE (%) (95% CI)       | Likelihood Ratio |
|----------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Mixed non-cardiac surgery  | BNP         | 0 - 99           | 5.3 (3.2 - 7.2)         | 0.58              |
|                            |             | 100 - 250        | 11.6 (4.3 - 18.8)       | 1.38              |
|                            |             | ≥250             | 26.9 (17.1 - 35.5)      | 3.88              |
|                            | NT-proBNP   | 0 - 300          | 5.2 (4 - 6.8)           | 0.42              |
|                            |             | 301 - 900        | 16.1 (12 - 20.2)        | 1.46              |
|                            |             | 901 - 3,000      | 26 (18.3 - 33.7)        | 2.6               |
|                            |             | >3,000           | 39.5 (26.3 - 52.6)      | 4.97              |

### Troponin
- Myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS) is defined as a postoperative troponin elevation with no evidence of a nonischemic etiology.
- Classic signs and symptoms of MI are often absent, and it commonly occurs within the first 48 hours after surgery, detectable through daily troponin screening.
- Diagnostic definition of MINS with 5th generation high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT): an absolute change of at least 5 ng/L if the level is between 20 to <65 ng/L, or a hsTnT level of at least 65 ng/L.
- Management involves supportive treatment: addressing tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, and bleeding (anemia). ECG and cardiology consultation for significant findings (e.g., ST elevation, new left-bundle branch block) are necessary. Statin and aspirin therapy should be started or continued, and beta-blockers should be continued if the patient is hemodynamically stable.

## Medication Management

### Beta Blockers
- Chronic beta-blocker medication should be continued throughout the perioperative period.
- Beta-blocker therapy should not be started immediately before surgery.

### Alpha Agonist
- Not recommended for initiation in the immediate preoperative period.

### Calcium Channel Blocker
- Chronic medication can be continued, but initiation in the immediate preoperative period is not recommended.

### Aspirin
- Stop acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) at least 3 days before surgery and restart when there is minimal risk of surgical bleeding.
- Perioperative withdrawal of chronic ASA therapy does not increase cardiac or other arterial thrombotic events.
- Continuation of ASA is recommended for patients with recent coronary stents (bare-metal stents within 3 months or drug-eluting stents within 1 year) and patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.
- Chronic beta-blocker medication should be continued throughout the perioperative period.

### ACE-I/ARB
- Stop 24 hours before surgery and restart when the risk of hypotension has passed.

### Statins
- Statins should be continued in the perioperative period.

##### 'Cardiac Big 5'
- Acute coronary syndromes (ACS)
- Decompensated heart failure (NYHA grades 3 and 4)
- Severe valvular lesions (especially severe aortic stenosis)
- Arrhythmias (especially the tachyarrhythmias or a bradycardia requiring pacing)
- Pericarditis.
- These conditions necessitate an immediate referral to cardiology for either a definitive repair or optimization prior to elective non-cardiac surgery.

## Practical Approach to Perioperative Risk Optimization for Non-Cardiac Surgery in South Africa

### Cardiac Screening: DASI

#### What is the Effort Tolerance?
- A cornerstone of perioperative screening has been effort tolerance, where a metabolic equivalent of >4 (MET >4) has traditionally been thought of as the minimum requirement to withstand anesthesia safely. This is not standardized.
- Self-reported exercise tolerance does not correlate with CPET outputs (peak oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold), and self-reported METS <4 had a sensitivity of only 19.4%.
- DASI scores were predictive of the primary outcome.
- The DASI combines 12 questions and provides a score, which is then calculated as a metabolic equivalent.

# Peri-Operative Approach to Patients with Ventricular Assist Devices Undergoing Non-Cardiac Surgery

## Pre-Operative

- **Multidisciplinary team identified:**
	- Primary surgical and anaesthesia teams
	- Cardiac surgery team
	- HF cardiologist
	- VAD personnel
- **Pre-operative medical optimization** when possible or necessary.
- **Physical examination** focused on the sequelae of HF.
- **Baseline tests:**
	- ECG
	- Echocardiogram
	- Laboratory values
- **Manage pacemaker/ICD settings** when indicated.
- **CT examination** to evaluate possible driveline interference with the operative field.
- **Anticoagulation management:** Hold, bridge, or reverse anticoagulation when indicated, after VAD team consultation.

## Intra-Operative

- **Monitoring:**
	- Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors.
	- Cerebral tissue oxygenation.
	- Processed electroencephalogram.
	- Arterial line with ultrasound guidance.
	- Central venous catheter if fluid shifts are expected.
	- PA catheter only if severe pulmonary hypertension.
	- TEE available.
- **Monitor VAD control console.**
- **External defibrillator pads** in place.
- **Optimize pre-load, support RV function, avoid increase in afterload.**
- **Gradual peritoneal insufflations** and position changes.

## Post-Operative

- **Care Unit:** Standard post-anaesthesia care unit unless ICU is otherwise indicated.
- **Extubation criteria** are unchanged.
- **Avoid hypoventilation**, optimize oxygenation.
- **Resume heparin infusion** when post-operative bleeding risk is acceptable.

# Management of Oral Anticoagulation Therapy in Patients Undergoing Non-Cardiac Surgery (NCS)

## Patient Assessment and Risk Stratification

### NCS-Related Bleeding Risk

1. **High Bleeding Risk NCS:**
	- **Yes:** Assess thrombotic risk.
	- **No:** Proceed with standard management.

### Thrombotic Risk

1. **High Thrombotic Risk:**
	
	- **Yes:** Evaluate specific patient conditions:
		- **Mechanical Heart Valve:**
			- Use **VKA** or **VKA/NOAC**:
				- **VKA:** Continue with INR in lower level or short interruption (Class I).
				- **VKA/NOAC:** Bridging is not recommended (Class III).
				- **Bridging:** Consider (Class IIa).
		- **Selected Patients with Very High Thromboembolic Risk:**
			- Evaluate if NCS can be deferred.
				- **Yes:** Defer NCS (Class I).
				- **No:** Interrupt anticoagulation (Class I).
					- Bridging is not recommended (Class III).
2. **Not High Thrombotic Risk:**
	
	- Proceed with standard anticoagulation management.

### Recommendations Based on Anticoagulant Type

1. **Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA):**
	
	- Continue with INR in lower level or short interruption (Class I).
	- Bridging is not recommended (Class III).
2. **Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulant (NOAC):**
	
	- Short interruption (Class I).
	- Bridging is not recommended (Class III).

# Bridging with Intravenous Antiplatelet Agents for Non-Cardiac Surgery (NCS)

## Overview

This guideline provides a structured approach for bridging patients on antiplatelet therapy undergoing non-cardiac surgery (NCS), ensuring the continuation of low-dose ASA (acetylsalicylic acid) throughout the perioperative period.

## Pre-Operative Management

### Days -7 to -1

- **Discontinue Prasugrel:**
	- Stop 7 days before surgery.
- **Discontinue Clopidogrel/Ticagrelor:**
	- Stop 5 days before surgery.

### Days -3 to -1

- **Infusion of Tirofiban/Eptifibatide:**
	- **Tirofiban:**
		- Start 0.1 μg/kg/min; adjust to 0.05 μg/kg/min if creatinine clearance <50 mL/min.
	- **Eptifibatide:**
		- Start 2.0 μg/kg/min; adjust to 1.0 μg/kg/min if creatinine clearance <50 mL/min.
	- Continue infusion until oral P2Y12_{12}12​ inhibitor therapy is possible.

## Perioperative Management

### Day 0 (Day of Surgery)

- **NCS:**
	- Continue low-dose ASA throughout.
	- **Infusion of Tirofiban/Eptifibatide:** Continue until 4-6 hours before surgery.
- **Post-Surgery (4-6 hours after NCS):**
	- Restart Clopidogrel (LD 300 mg), followed by 75 mg once daily (o.d.).
	- Alternatively, restart Tirofiban/Eptifibatide or Cangrelor.

## Post-Operative Management

### Follow-Up/Discharge

- **Continue low-dose ASA throughout.**
- **Clopidogrel:** Start with a loading dose (LD) of 300 mg, followed by 75 mg o.d. or restart the infusion agent used pre-operatively (Tirofiban/Eptifibatide/Cangrelor).

## Notes

- **Tirofiban Dose Adjustment:**
	- Standard: 0.1 μg/kg/min.
	- If creatinine clearance <50 mL/min: Adjust to 0.05 μg/kg/min.
- **Eptifibatide Dose Adjustment:**
	- Standard: 2.0 μg/kg/min.
	- If creatinine clearance <50 mL/min: Adjust to 1.0 μg/kg/min.
- **Cangrelor Infusion:**
	- Initiate within 72 hours from P2Y12_{12}12​ inhibitor discontinuation at a dose of 0.75 μg/kg/min for a minimum of 48 hours and a maximum of 7 days.

This bridging strategy ensures the balance between minimizing thrombotic risk and managing bleeding risk during the perioperative period for patients on antiplatelet therapy undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

# C4NC Guidelines

## Perioperative Risk Assessment and Postoperative Monitoring for Patients Undergoing Non-Cardiac Surgery

### Patient Selection
- **Age ≥45 years** with known significant cardiovascular disease.
- **Age 18-44 years** with known significant cardiovascular disease.
- Undergoing non-cardiac surgery requiring overnight hospital admission.

### Timing of Surgery

1. **Emergency Surgery:**
   - Proceed to surgery without additional preoperative cardiac assessment.

2. **Urgent/Semi-Urgent Surgery:**
   - Proceed to surgery.
   - Undertake preoperative cardiac assessment only if there is an unstable cardiac condition or suspected undiagnosed severe pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) or obstructive cardiac disease.

3. **Elective Surgery:**
   - Assess perioperative cardiac risk.
   - Perform risk stratification with the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI).
   - If RCRI ≥1, or age ≥65 years, or age 45-64 years with significant cardiovascular disease, order NT-proBNP/BNP.

### Preoperative Assessment
- **Age ≥65 years** or **18-64 years** with significant cardiovascular disease:
  - **Positive NT-proBNP/BNP:**
	- NT-proBNP ≥300 mg/L or BNP ≥92 mg/L.
	- Measure troponin daily for 48-72 hours.
	- Obtain ECG in PACU.
	- Consider in-hospital shared-care management.
  - **NT-proBNP/BNP not available:**
	- Measure troponin daily for 48-72 hours.
	- Obtain ECG in PACU.
	- Consider in-hospital shared-care management.
  - **Negative NT-proBNP/BNP:**
	- NT-proBNP <300 mg/L or BNP <92 mg/L.
	- No additional routine postoperative monitoring.

### Decision Algorithm

1. **Emergency Surgery:**
   - Proceed to surgery without additional preoperative cardiac assessment.

2. **Urgent/Semi-Urgent Surgery:**
   - Proceed to surgery.
   - Undertake preoperative cardiac assessment only if there is an unstable cardiac condition or suspected undiagnosed severe PHTN or obstructive cardiac disease.

3. **Elective Surgery:**
   - Assess perioperative cardiac risk.
   - Perform risk stratification with RCRI.
   - If RCRI ≥1, or patient is ≥65 years, or age 45-64 years with significant cardiovascular disease:
	 - Order NT-proBNP/BNP.

### Postoperative Monitoring

1. **Positive NT-proBNP/BNP:**
   - Measure troponin daily for 48-72 hours.
   - Obtain ECG in PACU.
   - Consider in-hospital shared-care management.

2. **NT-proBNP/BNP Not Available:**
   - Measure troponin daily for 48-72 hours.
   - Obtain ECG in PACU.
   - Consider in-hospital shared-care management.

3. **Negative NT-proBNP/BNP:**
   - No additional routine postoperative monitoring.

This flowchart and guideline offer a comprehensive approach for assessing perioperative cardiac risk and determining the need for postoperative monitoring based on individual patient risk factors and surgery type.

## Management of Interventions Targeting the Prevention of Perioperative Cardiac Events

### Management of Chronic Medications and Smoking Before Non-Cardiac Surgery

#### ASA (Acetylsalicylic Acid)
- **Withhold at least 3 days before surgery.**
- **Restart ASA** when the risk of bleeding related to surgery has passed (i.e., 8-10 days after major non-cardiac surgery).

#### β-Blocker
- **Continue β-blocker** during the perioperative period.
  - If the patient's systolic blood pressure is low before surgery, consider decreasing or holding the dose of the β-blocker.

#### ACEI/ARB (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor/Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker)
- **Withhold ACEI/ARB 24 hours before non-cardiac surgery.**
- **Restart ACEI/ARB** on day 2 after surgery if the patient is hemodynamically stable.

#### Statin
- **Continue statin** during the perioperative period.

#### Smoking
- **Discuss and facilitate smoking cessation**, ideally starting ≥4 weeks before surgery (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy).

### Initiation of New Medications and Coronary Revascularization Before Non-Cardiac Surgery

#### ASA
- **Do not initiate ASA** for the prevention of perioperative cardiac events.

#### β-Blocker
- **Do not initiate a β-blocker** within 24 hours before non-cardiac surgery.

#### α\(_2\)-Agonist
- **Do not initiate an α\(_2\)-agonist** for the prevention of perioperative cardiovascular events.

#### Calcium Channel Blocker
- **Do not initiate a calcium channel blocker** for the prevention of perioperative cardiovascular events.

#### Coronary Revascularization
- **Do not undertake preoperative prophylactic coronary revascularization** for patients with stable coronary artery disease.

### Special Considerations
- **Unstable CAD:** Individualized risk/benefit assessment of revascularization and delay (procedure + post-revascularization and DAPT) vs. expediting the non-cardiac surgery.

**Note:**
- These guidelines apply to patients aged ≥45 years with significant cardiovascular disease or aged 18-44 years with severe obstructive intracardiac abnormality undergoing non-cardiac surgery requiring hospital admission.
- Individualized assessment is necessary for patients with recent coronary artery stents or those undergoing high-risk surgeries such as carotid endarterectomy.

## CAD for Non-Cardiac Surgery Recommendations
1. **Either** Volatile or TIVA.
2. **Neuraxial** for post-op analgesia in aortic surgery, pre-op for hip fracture.
3. **TEE** if hemodynamically unstable.
4. **Normothermia** maintenance.
5. **Hemodynamic assist devices** if hemodynamically unstable.
6. **PAC** when underlying medical conditions affecting hemodynamics cannot be corrected pre-op.
7. **Not recommended:**
   - Routine TEE.
   - Routine PAC.
   - Prophylactic nitroglycerin.

## Pediatric Considerations

### Major Physiological Status Risk Factors

1. **Cardiac Failure:**
   - **Signs:** Raised HR + RR, sweating, cool peripheries, hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, poor feeding.
   - **Risk:** 10% cardiac arrest, 96% inotropic support (less if HF milder).
   - **Anesthesia:** Prolonged induction time, avoid prolonged use of 8% sevo, avoid propofol.

2. **Pulmonary Hypertension (PHTN):**
   - **Risk:** 8 times more likely to have a major complication.
   - **Anesthesia:** Reduced pulmonary compliance + increased airway resistance, respiratory tract infections poorly tolerated.

3. **Arrhythmia:**
   - **Risk:** Ventricular ectopics = ominous sign, 30% die suddenly.
   - **Single ventricle circulation:** 30% risk of arrhythmia leading to death.

4. **Cyanosis:**
   - **Risk:** Polycythemia = hyperviscosity, cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis (worsened by dehydration).
   - **Coagulopathy:** Abnormal clotting in 20% (platelet dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, clotting factor reduction).

### Factors Associated with Increased Risk of Complications
- Disease complexity (single ventricle, balanced, cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis).
- Physiological status.
- Type of surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, vascular, cross-matched blood required, emergency).
- Young age (<6 months, even up to 2 years risk may be higher).
- Syndromic conditions.
