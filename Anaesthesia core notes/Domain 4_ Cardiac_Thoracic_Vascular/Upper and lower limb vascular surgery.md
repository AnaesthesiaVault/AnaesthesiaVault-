# Upper and Lower Limb Vascular Surgery

## Critical Limb Ischaemia

- Up to 15% of patients with asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) will develop symptoms of intermittent claudication (IC) or critical limb ischaemia (CLI). A further 1-3% of these patients will require major limb amputation within a 5-year period.
- IC is characterized by aching muscle pain brought on by exercise and relieved by rest. The underlying cause is a reduction in tissue oxygen delivery due to decreased blood flow and increased tissue oxygen demand during exercise. PAD most commonly affects the superficial femoral artery, leading to calf claudication pain.
- Ischaemic rest pain and tissue loss (ulcers or gangrene) are key signs of CLI. Intervention should be considered when conservative measures have failed and symptoms become debilitating and lifestyle-restricting.
- The surgical goals are to relieve ischaemic rest pain, heal ischaemic ulcers, prevent limb loss, improve quality of life, and prolong survival.
