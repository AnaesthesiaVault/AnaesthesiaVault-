# Introduction

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) initiates thrombocytopenia, functional platelet defects, activation of fibrinolysis, and depletion of coagulation factors. Up to 30% of patients develop significant microvascular bleeding after cardiac surgery, accounting for 10% of all red cell transfusions.

- Blood management, spanning the entire perioperative period, aims to
	- optimize preoperative hemoglobin levels and hematopoiesis
	- correct underlying coagulopathy
	- minimize intraand postoperative blood loss,
	- maximize tissue oxygen delivery.
- Factors associated with increased transfusion risk include age, anaemia, female gender, body size, preoperative use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, significant systemic disease, CPB time, and type and urgency of procedure.

## Rationale for Conservation
- Bleeding, anemia, and transfusion of allogeneic blood are important predictors of adverse outcomes.

## Anemia Risk
- Anemia is a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes and mortality.
- Tissue hypoxia does not occur in the brain and heart until hemoglobin (Hb) is below 4 gm/dL, but evidence of tissue hypoxia occurs earlier in other tissues. Activation of hypoxic mechanisms and increased morbidity and mortality are observed near a hemoglobin of 6-7 gm/dL.

### Effects of Anemia

#### Physiological Effects
- DO₂ = CO x (Hb x 1.34 x SaO₂) + 0.003PaO₂
- ↓ Hb ⇒ ↓ O₂ carrying capacity → ↓ DO₂ → compensation → decompensation → hypoxia → organ dysfunction

#### Adaptation to Anemia
- **Non-Hemodynamic**
  - ↑ EPO ← hypoxia
  - ↑ O₂ extraction ← ↓ Hb O₂ affinity ← rightward OHDC ← ↑ 2,3 DPG
- **Hemodynamic**
  - ↓ AL ← ↓ SVR ← ↓ blood viscosity + vasodilation (endothelial NO + hypoxic metabolites)
  - ↑ PL ← ↑ venous return ← venoconstriction ← SNS
  - ↑ MC ← ↑ PL (Frank-Starling) + SNS
  - ⇒ ↑ CO
##### Haemodynamic Effects Summary
- ↓ Erythrocytes
	- ↓ Blood viscosity
	- ↓ Peripheral resistance
- ↓ Hemoglobin
	- ↓ O₂ delivery
		- ↑ Chemoreceptor discharge
			- ↑ Sympathetic activity
				- ↑ Heart rate
				- ↑ Myocardial contractility
				- ↑ Venous tone
		  - Arterial vasodilation
			- ↑ EDRF (NO) availability
			  - Recruitment of vessels (angiogenesis)
				- ↑ Flow partition
					- ↑ Cardiac output
						- ↑ Stroke volume
							- ↑ Venous return
								- ↓ Resistance to venous return

## Strategies for Management of Blood Loss during Surgery (Blood Conservation)

1. **Blood Salvage Reinfusion**:
	- Used in blood losses > 1-1.5L
	- Patient blood collected, heparinized, washed to remove debris and anticoagulant, and reinfused.
2. **Autologous Transfusion**:
	- Hct > 34 or Hb > 11
	- Collection of own blood 4-5 weeks prior to surgery
	- 72 hours between donations
	- Supplement with iron and erythropoietin
	- Clerical errors and infection can still occur
3. **Normovolemic Hemodilution**:
	- Relies on the premise that if the red cell concentration is decreased, the red cell loss is reduced when large amounts of blood are shed.
	- 1-2 units of blood removed just prior to surgery and replaced with crystalloid and colloid.
4. **Donor Directed Transfusions**:
	- From compatible family members.

## Storage of RBC

- Shelf life of 42 days
- 20-40% of all stored RBC units are >28 days old at the time of transfusion, and with supply fluctuations, up to 40% of blood may be within 3 days of expiration.
- RBCs undergo many complex biochemical, environmental, structural, and biomechanical changes during storage.

## STS/SCA Guidelines for Blood Conservation

### Consequences of Transfusion of Stored RBC
- Prolonged storage time has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in various clinical settings, including patients with trauma, sepsis, and critical illness.
- For cardiac surgery, length of RBC storage correlates with death, renal dysfunction, and ICU length of stay.
  - Each additional day of RBC storage increases the risk of pneumonia by 1-6%.
  - Blood stored less than 20 days significantly increased brain tissue oxygenation, whereas stored blood (>20 days) did not.
  - Patients given older blood had significantly worse composite clinical outcomes, including renal failure (2.7% vs 1.6%), prolonged intubation (9.7% vs 5.6%), and sepsis (4.0% vs 2.8%). In addition, in-hospital and 1-year mortality were significantly higher in the old-blood group.

### Antifibrinolytic Safety
- Main safety issues include hypersensitivity reactions, renal effects, thrombotic events, and mortality.
- Tranexamic acid: 30 mg/kg loading dose + 2 mg/kg in pump prime + 16 mg/kg/hr infusion.
- Optimum dosage regimen for individual antifibrinolytic drugs is not known.

### Drug-Related Causes of Bleeding
- Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel or oral anticoagulants within 5 days of cardiac surgery increases perioperative bleeding.
- Current guidelines recommend discontinuation of such therapy at least 5 days before CABG.

### Recombinant Factor VIIa (rVIIa)
- Safe and effective for treating bleeding episodes in patients with Hemophilia A or B and inhibitors.
- Mechanism: increased site-specific thrombin generation from activated platelets and/or tissue factor-mediated activation of coagulation
- CRAFT study: reduction in median allogeneic RBC unit transfusions from 8 to 2 units after rVIIa treatment.
- Higher incidence of critical serious adverse events, including stroke, with rVIIa treatment.

### Hemopoetic Therapy
- Recombinant EPO increases hemoglobin concentration, reduces allogeneic transfusion, and improves functional capacity and clinical outcomes.
- Iron therapy should be considered for patients receiving EPO or are iron deficient.
- Typical EPO regimen: 40,000 IU (600 IU/kg) SC weekly for up to 4 doses with iron supplementation.
- Main concerns: cost, off-label use, lack of established safety data, and adverse thrombotic outcomes when hematocrit >40%.

### Preoperative Autologous Donation (PAD)
- One or two single-unit donations can be collected weekly 2-4 weeks preoperatively with iron supplementation (± EPO) to allow hemoglobin normalization.
- Contraindicated in patients with unstable coronary symptoms, stenotic valvular disease, Hb <13 gm/dL, or bacterial infection.
- PAD blood can be stored for 35 days. Scheduling issues and logistics have limited PAD use in some institutions.
