# Peri-operative Myocardial Infarction (PMI) and Myocardial Injury After Non-Cardiac Surgery (MINS)

## Myocardial Injury After Non-Cardiac Surgery (MINS)
### Definition of MINS

Elevated postoperative cardiac troponin levels resulting from myocardial ischaemia without evidence of a non-ischaemic cause for the troponin elevation.

### Diagnosis of MINS
- Relies on routine daily postoperative cardiac troponin surveillance for 48-72 hours postoperatively in patients with a >5% risk of major perioperative cardiovascular complications.
- Raised postoperative troponin >65 ng/L or an absolute increase in hs-cTnT of 5 ng/L with peak 20-65 ng/L without ischaemic features on ECG
- Any peak hs-cTnT ≥ 65 ng/L
- Note: MINS is usually due to mismatch perfusion rather than plaque rupture.
### Incidence and Presentation
  - MINS most commonly presents within the first 3 postoperative days.
  - About 1 in 14 in-hospital patients aged ≥45 years undergoing non-cardiac surgery will experience MINS.
  - More than 80% of MINS patients are asymptomatic for myocardial ischaemia and would not fulfil the universal definition of myocardial infarction, despite having a similar prognosis.
### Pathophysiology

The perioperative milieu (surgical stress response, sympathetic activation, hypercoagulability, hypotension, bleeding, anaemia, and pain) contributes to relative myocardial hypoperfusion and ischaemia, differentiating MINS from myocardial infarction in non-surgical patients.

### Prognosis
  - MINS has a 30-day mortality of 10%.
#### 30-Day Mortality Associated with hs-cTnT Levels

- **14 - <20 ng/L**: Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 9.1, 30-day mortality 1.1%
- **20 - <65 ng/L**: HR 23.6, 30-day mortality 3.0%
- **65 - <1000 ng/L**: HR 70.3, 30-day mortality 9.1%
- **≥1000 ng/L**: HR 227.0, 30-day mortality 29.6%

#### Independent Predictors of 30-Day Mortality in MINS Patients

- Age ≥75 years: Adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.06
- ST elevation or new LBBB: OR 3.96
- Anterior ischaemic changes on ECG: OR 2.33
### Perioperative Risk Factors for the Development of MINS

- Increasing age
- Current atrial fibrillation
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Congestive heart failure
- Coronary artery disease
- Peripheral vascular disease
- Stroke
- Decreasing renal function
- Urgent or emergency surgery
## MINS Vs Acute MI

- MINS occurs if the troponin is elevated postoperatively without signs and symptoms and fluctuates (i.e., goes back down).
- If the troponin remains stable and elevated, it is due to myocardial injury (non-ischaemic) e.g., due to renal disease or structural heart disease.

## Post Operative Myocardial Infarction (PMI)

### Fourth Universal Definition of Acute Myocardial Infarction

#### Myocardial Injury

- **Definition**: Evidence of elevated cardiac troponin values (cTn) with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit.
- **Criteria**: Injury is considered acute if there is a rise and/or fall of cTn values.

#### Myocardial Ischaemia

- **Criteria**: At least one of the following:
	1. Symptoms of myocardial ischaemia.
	2. New ischaemic ECG changes.
	3. Development of pathological Q-waves.
	4. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall-motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischaemic etiology.
	5. Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy.

#### ECG Changes

##### ST-Elevation

- **Definition**: New ST-elevation at the J-point in two contiguous leads with the cut-points:
	- ≥1 mm in all leads other than leads V2-V3.
	- Following cut-points apply for leads V2-V3:
		- ≥2 mm in men ≥40 years.
		- ≥2.5 mm in men <40 years.
		- ≥1.5 mm in women regardless of age.

##### ST-Depression and T-Wave Changes

- **Definition**: New horizontal or downsloping ST-depression ≥0.5 mm in two contiguous leads.
- And/or T inversion ≥1 mm in two contiguous leads with prominent R wave or R/S ratio >1.

#### Q-Wave Criteria

- Any Q wave in leads V2-V3 > 0.02 s or QS complex in leads V2-V3.
- Q wave ≥ 0.03 s and ≥ 1 mm deep or QS complex in leads I, II, aVL, aVF or V4-V6 in any two leads of a contiguous lead grouping (I, aVL; V1-V6; II, III, aVF).
- R wave ≥ 0.04 s in V1-V2 and R/S > 1 with a concordant positive T wave in the absence of conduction defect.

## Postoperative Troponin Surveillance Recommendations (CCS)

- Daily postoperative cTnT surveillance for 48-72 hours if baseline risk >5% for cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction at 30 days after surgery, including:
	- Elevated preoperative NT-proBNP or BNP measurement
	- RCRI score ≥1
	- Age 45-64 years with significant cardiovascular disease
	- Age ≥65 years

### RCRI (Revised Cardiac Risk Index)
- High-risk-type surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or supra-inguinal vascular)
- Ischaemic heart disease
- History of congestive heart failure
- History of cerebrovascular disease
- Insulin therapy for diabetes
- Preoperative serum creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dL (177 µmol/L)
