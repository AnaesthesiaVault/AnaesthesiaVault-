## MOA

![](Pasted%20image%2020240301125332.png)

- **Balloon Inflation and Deflation:**
	
	- The balloon inflates immediately after aortic valve closure.
	- The balloon deflates immediately prior to ventricular ejection.
- **Physiological Effects:**
	
	- **Increased Systolic Peak Pressure (during diastole):**
		- Improves coronary perfusion.
	- **End-Diastolic Pressure:**
		- Decreases left ventricular (LV) afterload.
		- Reduces stroke work.
		- Lowers myocardial oxygen consumption.

### Design

- **Volume Displacement:**
	
	- The balloon displaces 30-50 mL of volume.
	- The size of the balloon is based on the patient's height.
- **Inflation Medium:**
	
	- The balloon is filled with helium due to its low density, facilitating rapid movement.

### Goals

- **Improved Coronary Perfusion:**
	- Increases oxygen supply to the myocardium.
- **Reduced Stroke Work:**
	- Decreases oxygen consumption by the myocardium.

### Concept

1. **Diastolic Pressure Time Index (DPTI):**
	
	- A measure of coronary perfusion.
	- Calculated as: Coronary perfusion x Diastolic time.
2. **Systolic Tension Time Index (STTI):**
	
	- Represents oxygen demand.
	- Calculated as: Systolic pressure x Systolic time.
- **Effect of IABP:**
	- Increases DPTI (improving coronary perfusion).
	- Reduces STTI (decreasing myocardial oxygen demand).

## Abnormal Waveforms
### Early Balloon Inflation Results in Increased Afterload

### Late Balloon Inflation Results in Decreased Diastolic Augmentation

### Early Balloon Deflation Fails to Decrease Myocardial Oxygen Demand

### Late Balloon Deflation Increases Afterload

![](Pasted%20image%2020240301125739.png)

### Poor Diastolic Augmentation Results in Suboptimal Coronary Perfusion

### Early Inflation and Late Deflation Increase Afterload; the opposite Fail to Augment
