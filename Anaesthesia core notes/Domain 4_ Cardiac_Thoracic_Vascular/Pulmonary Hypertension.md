# Summary

# Pulmonary Hypertension

## Epidemiology

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can be associated with various disorders including congenital heart disease, connective tissue diseases like systemic sclerosis, HIV, portal hypertension, and sickle cell disease.

### Incidence
- **HIV**: 0.5%, 6-12 times that of the general population.
- **Portal hypertension**: 2-6%, often contraindicates liver transplantation.
- **Sickle cell disease**: 10-30%.

### Predictors of Poor Prognosis
- Poor functional status and exercise capacity (measured by 6 min walk test)
- Elevated right atrial pressure
- Significant right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and failure
- Low cardiac index
- Elevated biomarkers: brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein
- Diagnosis of scleroderma

### Perioperative Complication
- 29% incidence rate

## Symptoms
- Fatigue
- Dyspnea
- Syncope
- Palpitations
- Peripheral edema

## Classification
### Definition
- PH is defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) ≥ 25 mmHg at rest.

### Severity
- Mild: mPAP 25-40 mmHg
- Moderate: mPAP 40-55 mmHg
- Severe: mPAP > 55 mmHg

### Types
1. **Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)**: Idiopathic, heritable, drug/toxin-induced, associated with conditions like connective tissue diseases, HIV, and others.
2. **PH due to Left Heart Disease**: Includes systolic/diastolic dysfunction and valvular diseases.
3. **PH due to Lung Diseases/Hypoxia**: COPD, interstitial lung disease, sleep-disordered breathing, etc.
4. **Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH)**: Results from complications of pulmonary embolism.
5. **PH with Unclear/Multifactorial Mechanisms**: Includes hematologic, systemic, metabolic disorders, and others.

### Hemodynamic Definitions
- **Pre-Capillary PH**: mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg, pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) ≤ 15 mmHg.
- **Post-Capillary PH**: mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg, PWP > 15 mmHg, with further subclassification based on transpulmonary gradient.

## Diagnosis
- Requires right heart catheterization.
- PAH confirmed if pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) > 3 Wood units.
- Differentiating PH from left heart disease is crucial for appropriate treatment.

### Vasodilator Testing
- Inhaled nitric oxide, adenosine, or prostacyclin used.
- A positive response indicates potential benefit from long-term calcium channel blocker treatment.

## Risk Factors for Morbidity and Mortality
### Patient Factors
- Functional class ≥ 2, 6Min Walk Distance < 300 m, history of coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism, renal insufficiency, RVH with severe systolic dysfunction, higher mPAP.

### Surgical Factors
- Emergency surgery, intermediate/high-risk surgery, ASA physical status > 2, anesthesia duration > 3 hours, intra-operative use of vasopressors.

## Treatment
1. Treat the underlying cause.
2. Symptomatic treatment with diuretics, oxygen therapy, and specific drugs like calcium channel blockers, prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists, and PDE-5 inhibitors.

### Drugs for PAH
- Calcium channel blockers: Amlodipine
- Endothelin receptor antagonists: Ambrisentan, Bosentan (replaced by Macitentan)
- PDE-5 inhibitors: Sildenafil
- Guanylate cyclase stimulators: Riociguat
- Prostacyclin analogues: Epoprostenol
- Prostacyclin IP receptor agonists: Selexipag

### Mechanism of Treatment
- Milrinone: PDE-3 inhibition increases cAMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.
- Sildenafil: PDE-5 inhibition increases cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.
- NO: Activates guanylate cyclase, increasing cGMP, leading to decreased Ca²⁺ influx and smooth muscle relaxation.

### Effects of Anesthetic Agents

| Anaesthetic Agent | RV Contractility | Pulmonary Vascular Resistance |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Isoflurane        | ↓↓               | ↑                           |
| Desflurane        | ↓↓               | ↑↑                          |
| Sevoflurane       | ↔                | ↑↑                          |
| Nitrous oxide     | ↓↓               | ↑↑                          |
| Thiopental        | ↔                | ↓                           |
| Etomidate         |–|–|
| Ketamine          | ↑                | ↑ (adult), ↔ (child)        |
| Propofol          | ↓↓               | ↔                           |
| Opioids           | ↔                | ↔                           |
