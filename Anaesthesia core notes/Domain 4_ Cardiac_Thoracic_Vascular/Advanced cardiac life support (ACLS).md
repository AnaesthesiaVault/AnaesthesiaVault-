[Common reversible causes of cardiac arrest]([Common Reversible Causes of Cardiac Arrest (H’s) | Calgary Guide (ucalgary.ca)](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Common-Reversible-Causes-of-Cardiac-Arrest-Hs/))

- **Hypoxia (Oxygen deficiency in body tissues)**
	- **Pathophysiology**:
		- Oxygenated blood decreases reaching organs and muscle.
		- Peripheral vasoconstriction.
	- **Mechanism**:
		- Anaerobic cellular metabolism.
		- Production of acidic by products (lactate).
		- ↓ ATP from anaerobic metabolism renders Na⁺/K⁺ pump unable to move Na⁺ outside the cell.
	- **Clinical Findings**:
		- Cool, pale skin.
		- Drop in blood pressure.
- **Hypovolemia (Decreased intravascular volume)**
	- **Pathophysiology**:
		- Decreased blood volume.
	- **Mechanism**:
		- Peripheral vasoconstriction.
	- **Clinical Findings**:
		- Cool, pale skin.
		- Drop in blood pressure.
- **Hypothermia (Decreased core body temperature)**
	- **Pathophysiology**:
		- Decreased body temperature.
		- Catecholamine release.
	- **Mechanism**:
		- Reflex adrenergic vasoconstriction of skin.
		- Reduction in active calcium pump units.
		- Prolonged action potential of cardiac cells.
		- Myocardial conduction delay.
	- **Clinical Findings**:
		- Bradycardia (slow heart rate).
- **Hydrogen Ion (H⁺) (Acidemia, ↑H⁺ in blood)**
	- **Pathophysiology**:
		- Rising H⁺ levels in circulation.
		- Physiologic attempt to correct through expulsion of CO₂ (increased respirations).
	- **Mechanism**:
		- Competitive inhibition of calcium current in cardiac cells by hydrogen ions.
	- **Clinical Findings**:
		- Cardiac electrical instability.
- **Hyperkalemia (↑K⁺ in the blood)**
	- **Pathophysiology**:
		- Increased K⁺ in circulation.
		- ↑ Concentration gradient of H⁺ shifts K⁺ outside the cell.
	- **Mechanism**:
		- Altered automaticity, conductivity, and excitability of the heart.
	- **Clinical Findings**:
		- Pathological heart rhythms.
		- Decreased cardiac contractility and output.
- **Combined Effects**
	- **Pathophysiology**:
		- Intracellular Na⁺ -> osmotic swelling -> cell death.
		- Release of H⁺ and vasodilatory chemicals into circulation.
		- Blood high in H⁺ and K⁺ reaches the heart.
	- **Mechanism**:
		- Altered automaticity, conductivity, and excitability of the heart.
	- **Clinical Findings**:
		- Decreased cardiac contractility and output.
		- Pathological heart rhythms.
		- Cardiac arrest: Cessation of meaningful cardiac activity and circulating blood flow
# Death Mechanisms

[Death mechanism](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Death-Cardiovascular-Respiratory-and-Neurologic-Mechanisms/)

### Cardiovascular System Insult
1. **Distributive Problems:**
	- Systemic inflammation (sepsis, anaphylaxis, pancreatitis)
	- Adrenal insufficiency, vasodilation, decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR)
		- Leads to **Low blood pressure (BP = CO x SVR)**
		- Causes **Decreased cardiac output (CO = SV x HR)**
2. **Obstructive Problems:**
	- Cardiac tamponade, pneumothorax, massive pulmonary embolism
		- **Low blood pressure**
		- **Decreased cardiac output**
3. **Hypovolemic Problems:**
	- Hemorrhage, dehydration, widespread skin disruption, burns
		- **Low blood pressure**
		- **Decreased cardiac output**
4. **Cardiac Problems:**
	- **Cardiac valve dysfunction:** Myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy
	- **Cardiac arrhythmia or heart block**
	- **Disturbed electrical activity in cardiomyocytes**
		- Results in **Low stroke volume (SV)**
		- Leads to **Low blood pressure** and **Decreased cardiac output**
5. **Peripheral Metabolic Disturbances:**
	- Hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, hypothermia, hyperthermia, toxins, severe thyroid derangement

### Respiratory System Insult
1. **Low Oxygen Content in Blood:**
	- Hypoxemia (Type I Respiratory Failure): Low dissolved oxygen (PaO2)
	- Hypercapnia/Hypercarbia (Type II Respiratory Failure): Elevated dissolved CO2 in blood (PaCO2)
2. **Low Atmospheric Pressure or Oxygen Content:**
	- Severe lung disease: Asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, lung collapse
	- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Pneumonia, aspiration, inhalational injury, drowning
	- Severe hypoventilation: Respiratory fatigue, chest wall disorders, toxins (e.g., opioids, botulism)
3. **Toxin-Induced Hypoxia:**
	- Cyanide, pesticides, arsenic
4. **Severe Anemia:**
	- Reduced hemoglobin
5. **Carbon Monoxide Poisoning:**
	- Hemoglobin reduced capacity to carry/release O2
### Nervous System Insult
1. **Decreased Level of Consciousness:**
	- Metabolic disturbances: Hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, uremia
	- Acute liver failure, drugs/toxins, alcohol withdrawal
2. **Seizure Activity:**
	- Status epilepticus
	- Injury to cervical/upper thoracic spinal cord
	- Brainstem lesion (e.g., stroke, neoplasm, inflammation)
3. **Increased Intracranial Pressure:**
	- Edema, hemorrhage, trauma, brain mass
	- Expanding skull contents squeeze brainstem (herniation)
4. **Disruption of Respiratory Control Center:**
	- Brainstem lesion, status epilepticus, cervical/upper thoracic spinal cord injury
#### Common Pathways to Death
1. **Bradycardia (Low Heart Rate, HR):**
	- Prolonged seizure
	- Disruption of spinal cord sympathetic control
2. **Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA):**
	- Organized electrical activity without cardiac output
	- Degenerates to asystole or respiratory arrest
3. **Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):**
	- Can degenerate to asystole
4. **Asystole:**
	- No cardiac electrical activity or output
5. **Respiratory Arrest:**
	- Cessation of breathing
6. **Hypoxia:**
	- Inadequate O2 delivery/utilization in tissues
	- Leads to metabolic disturbances impairing cardiac cell
#### Final Pathway
- **Death:** Irreversible cessation of cardiac, respiratory, and brain function.

# ACLS Guidelines

## Chain of Survival
#### Adult IHCA Chain of Survival (In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest)
1. **Early Recognition and Prevention:**
	- Identifying patients at risk and implementing preventive measures.
2. **Activation of Emergency Response:**
	- Promptly calling for help when cardiac arrest occurs.
3. **High-Quality CPR:**
	- Performing effective chest compressions and ventilations.
4. **Defibrillation:**
	- Delivering shocks to restore a normal heart rhythm.
5. **Post-Cardiac Arrest Care:**
	- Providing advanced medical treatment and monitoring after resuscitation.
6. **Recovery:**
	- Supporting patient rehabilitation and recovery to achieve the best possible outcome.
#### Adult OHCA Chain of Survival (Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest)
1. **Activation of Emergency Response:**
	- Immediately calling emergency services when cardiac arrest is recognized.
2. **High-Quality CPR:**
	- Administering effective chest compressions and ventilations to maintain circulation and oxygenation.
3. **Defibrillation:**
	- Using an automated external defibrillator (AED) to deliver shocks and restore a normal heart rhythm.
4. **Advanced Resuscitation:**
	- Providing advanced medical interventions by emergency medical services (EMS).
5. **Post-Cardiac Arrest Care:**
	- Continuing advanced medical treatment and monitoring after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).
6. **Recovery:**
	- Facilitating patient rehabilitation and recovery to optimize long-term outcomes.
