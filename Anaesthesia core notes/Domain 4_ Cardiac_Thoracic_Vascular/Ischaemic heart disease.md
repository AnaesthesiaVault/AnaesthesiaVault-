# Summary

# Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD)

## Pathogenesis of Various Types of IHD

[Pathogenesis and subtypes](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Overview-of-Ischemic-Heart-Disease/)

### Factors Contributing to Atherosclerosis
- **High Serum LDL:** ↑ Availability of lipids that deposit in arterial wall.
- **Low Serum HDL:** ↓ Removal of LDL from coronary artery walls (transport of LDL to liver is impaired).
- **Endothelial Dysfunction:** Compromise of endothelial barrier → vessel wall vulnerable to infiltration by LDL and cells of the immune system.

### Atherosclerosis
- Arterial wall degeneration, characterized by fat deposition in and fibrosis of the inner layer of arteries.
- **Occurs in Coronary Arteries:**

#### Stable Angina
    - **Stable Atheromatous Plaque:**
        - Fibromuscular cap overlying fatty plaque contents remains intact, and plaque contents are not released into the vessel lumen.
        - Plaque serves as a fixed luminal obstruction to blood flow.
        - If vessel stenosis is significant (≥70%), myocardial oxygen demand starts to exceed supply, especially with exertion.
        - Predictable, transient myocardial ischemia.
    
#### Unstable Angina
    - **Unstable Atheromatous Plaque:**
        - Fibromuscular cap overlying fatty plaque ruptures.
        - Thrombogenic plaque contents (especially tissue factor) are exposed to coagulation factors in the vessel lumen.
        - Activation of platelets and the clotting cascade at the site of rupture.
        - Thrombus forms over already partially occlusive plaque → occludes lumen → ↓ perfusion of myocardium.
        - Transient ischemia of cardiomyocytes.
    
#### Myocardial Infarction (MI)
    - Infarction (death) of cardiomyocytes.
    
#### Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS)
    - Includes Unstable Angina and Myocardial Infarction.

## Myocardial Infarction: Findings on Investigations

### Complications
- **Tissue Ischemia:** Disrupts normal cardiac electrical conduction (detected on serial ECG).
	- **ST-Segment Depression:** Non-localizing, ischemia of sub-endocardial myocardium.
	- **ST-Segment Elevation:** Localizes to site of ischemia, acute, trans-mural myocardial ischemia.
	- If ischemia progresses to tissue infarction, **Pathologic Q-waves** form (localizes to site of ischemia).

### Additional Notes
- Both types of ST-segment changes can indicate myocardial infarctions but can also be false positives (e.g., caused by left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch blocks, and other non-myocardial ischemic causes).

## Complications of MI

[Complications of MI](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Complications-of-Myocardial-Infarction)

### Pathophysiology

#### Cardiac Contractility Due to Death of Cardiomyocytes
- **Inadequate Cardiac Output:**
	- Stasis of blood in the ventricle.
	- Formation of mural thrombus on akinetic inflamed wall segments.
	- Embolization of thrombus.
	- Systemic emboli (i.e., stroke, renal infarction, limb infarction).

#### Necrosis of Ventricular Wall 2° to Infarction
- **Transmural Necrosis:**
	- Dead tissue disrupts cardiac conduction system (e.g., bundle of His).
	- Causes acquired ventricular septal defect (VSD) and acquired mitral regurgitation (MR).

#### Irritability by Viable Tissue Adjacent to Area of Infarct
- **Myocardial Electrical Instability:**
	- Ectopic beats, re-entry circuits.
	- Necrotic tissue irritates and inflames pericarditis.

### Complications

#### Pump Dysfunction
- **Profound/Acute Dysfunction:**
	- Cardiac output ↓↓↓.
	- Cardiogenic shock: ↓ Systemic & myocardial perfusion.
	- Acidemia, systemic organ failure (renal failure, myocardial damage).
- **Less Profound/Acute Dysfunction:**
	- Congestive heart failure.
	- Ventricular aneurysm: Atria distend due to stasis, disrupts electrical conduction, atrial fibrillation.

#### Ventricular Free Wall Rupture
- If pericardial adhesion is covering the rupture, blood from rupture is contained within the adhesion.
	- False aneurysm: If adhesion bursts.
	- Cardiac tamponade: If excess inflammatory fluid/edema accumulates within the pericardial sac.

#### Arrhythmias
- Myocardial electrical instability, ectopic beats, re-entry circuits.

#### Pericarditis
- Inflammatory process.

### Pre-Op Testing
- **ECG:**
	- Detects myocardial ischemia, MI, cardiac rhythm/conduction disturbances, ventricular hypertrophy, and electrolyte abnormalities.
- **Peri-Operative Coronary Angiography:**
	1. High risk of adverse outcome based on non-invasive test results.
	2. Angina pectoris unresponsive to medical therapy.
	3. Unstable angina, particularly with intermediate or high-risk non-cardiac surgery.
	4. Equivocal non-invasive test results in high-risk patients undergoing high-risk surgery.

### Susceptibility to Perioperative Ischemia
- **Patient Factors:** Co-morbidities (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, AF, elderly, PFO, IE, DM, male, smoker).
- **Surgical Factors:** High-risk surgery (vascular, neuro, cardiac).

**Intraoperative Adverse Events:**
- Arrhythmias, hypotension, CPR, embolic phenomenon.

## Risk Stratification
- Type of surgery, presence/type of clinical indicators of coronary artery disease, and patient functional status.
- **Low-Risk Procedure:** Combined surgical and patient characteristics predict a MACE risk of death or MI of <1%. Procedures with a risk of MACE of ≥1% are considered elevated risk.

### Clinical Predictors of Increased Peri-Operative Cardiovascular Risk
- **Level of Risk: Major (Cardiac Risk > 5%)**
	- Unstable coronary syndromes
	- Decompensated CHF
	- Significant arrhythmias
	- Severe valvular disease
- **Level of Risk: Intermediate (Cardiac Risk < 5%)**
	- Mild angina pectoris
	- Prior MI
	- Compensated/prior HF
	- Diabetes mellitus (particularly on insulin)
	- Renal insufficiency
- **Level of Risk: Minor (Cardiac Risk < 1%)**
	- Advanced age
	- Abnormal ECG
	- Rhythm other than sinus
	- Low functional capacity
	- History of stroke
	- Uncontrolled systemic hypertension

### Assessment of Functional Capacity: The Duke Activity Index

# Peri-Operative Myocardial Infarction (MI)
- May be due to myocardial oxygen supply/demand mismatch or acute plaque disruption.
- **Prevention of Peri-Operative MI:** Pre-operative coronary revascularization and pharmacological intervention.

## Coronary Revascularization Indications
1. Acceptable coronary revascularization risk and viable myocardium with left main coronary artery stenosis.
2. Three-vessel coronary artery disease with left ventricular dysfunction.
3. Left main equivalent (high-grade block in left anterior descending and circumflex arteries).
4. Intractable coronary ischemia despite maximal medical therapy.
- Major noncardiac procedures should wait at least 4–6 weeks (possibly 6 months).
- In patients with recent coronary angioplasty and stenting, risk of stent thrombosis and MI increases if dual antiplatelet treatment is stopped; risk of surgical bleeding increases on continuation of drugs.
- Use low-dose aspirin (75 mg/day) based on individual decision considering peri-operative bleeding risk and thrombotic complications.
- ACC/AHA guidelines recommend a delay of at least 6 weeks between bare-metal stent insertion and noncardiac surgery, and 6 months (preferably 1 year) delay for drug-eluting stents for stent reendothelization. In case stent insertion is required before surgery, either bare-metal stent insertion or percutaneous angioplasty is preferable.
# Stents

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314140427.png)

## Bridging Therapy
- Drugs for bridging therapy: tirofiban, eptifibatide, and cangrelor.
- Oral antiplatelet drugs are stopped 5–7 days before planned surgical procedures and started on continuous IV infusion of tirofiban or eptifibatide until 4–6 h of procedures. These drugs are restarted postoperatively till DAPT can be reinstituted.

## Medical Management
- **Peri-Operative Beta-Blockers:**
	- Metoprolol, atenolol, and bisoprolol are commonly used.
	- Target HR: 50–70 bpm.
	- ACC/AHA guidelines suggest continuing beta blockers preoperatively and throughout the perioperative period in patients already on them.
	- Beta-blockers should be started at least 24 hours before elective surgery and dose titrated to achieve the target HR of 50–60 bpm without significant hypotension.
