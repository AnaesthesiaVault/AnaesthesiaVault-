## Differences Between Oxygen-Independent and Oxygen-Dependent Metabolism During Exercise

- **Duration of Exercise Test**:
  - Test duration of at least 10 minutes is recommended for assessing aerobic capacity, similar to anaerobic threshold testing.
  - Initial metabolism at the onset of exercise is predominantly anaerobic; oxidative phosphorylation dominates after about 2 minutes.
  - Time to oxidative phosphorylation is prolonged in conditions like heart failure, COPD, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes.
- **Relationship Between VO2peak and Anaerobic Threshold**:
  - Central (cardiorespiratory) and peripheral (musculoskeletal) factors influence the relationship.
  - Diseases like ischemic heart disease and heart failure affect this relationship.
  - The anaerobic threshold can vary from 50% to 100% of VO2peak.
  - Performance during exercise depends partly on mechanical efficiency; perioperative survival depends on cardiorespiratory capacity, not musculoskeletal function, although frailty is a strong predictor of perioperative morbidity and mortality.
- **Patients with Acceptable Aerobic Capacity but Poor Functional Group**:
  - Due to musculoskeletal factors associated with frailty.
  - Unlikely to die of cardiovascular failure in the perioperative period but at increased risk of postoperative complications.
  - AT testing minimizes peripheral factors' contribution to poor exercise performance by limiting weight-bearing with cycling.

## Assessment of Functional Capacity for Surgical Patients

- **Importance**:
  - Major surgery triggers a stress response lasting up to 72 hours, increasing oxygen consumption to about 5 ml/kg/min, sometimes up to 7 ml/kg/min.
  - Preoperative functional capacity assessment determines the ability to survive this increased metabolic demand.
  - In patients over 60 undergoing major abdominal surgery, an AT < 11 ml/kg/min during CPET predicts perioperative cardiovascular mortality.
- **Myocardial Ischemia and Poor Functional Capacity**:
  - Significantly increases adverse perioperative cardiac events.
  - Functional status is integral to the American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association preoperative cardiac evaluation algorithm.
  - Risk stratification is based on whether a patient can complete 4 METS of exercise.
  - The risk of myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest increases nearly threefold between functionally independent and dependent patients.

### Clinical Assessment of Functional Capacity

- **Common Assessments**:
  - Stair climbing, Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), six-minute shuttle walk test, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).

| Criteria                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anaerobic threshold > 11 ml/kg/min and VO2peak > 15 ml/kg/min** |
| DASI > 46                                                         |
| Shuttle walk > 360 m                                              |

- Despite limitations, the VO2peak can be estimated where CPET is unavailable:
  - **VO2peak (ml/kg/min)** = 13.43 + 0.02 x shuttle walk test distance (m)
  - **VO2peak (ml/kg/min)** = 11.82 + 0.23 x Duke Activity Status Index (DASI)

### Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET)

- **Calculation for Predicted Oxygen Consumption**:

  | Definition                   | Calculation                                      |
  | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
  | Unloaded VO2                 | VO2 unloaded (ml/min) = 150 + (6 x weight (kg))  |
  | Peak VO2 (female)            | Peak VO2 (ml/min) = height (cm)–age (years) x 14 |
  | Peak VO2 (male)              | Peak VO2 (ml/min) = height (cm)–age (years) x 20 |
  | Increment in work rate per min | (Watts/min) = (Peak VO2–Unloaded VO2) / 100  |

#### Interpretation of CPET Results

- **Anaerobic Threshold (AT)**:
  - Determined using the modified V-Slope method, confirmed by changes in variables like the respiratory exchange ratio, ventilatory efficiency, and end-tidal oxygen values.
  - V-slope method: Slope of VCO2-VO2 graph exceeds 1 due to increased glycolytic and lactate production.
  - Alternative methods may be used if AT determination is difficult.

### Determination of the Anaerobic Threshold

- **Combination of indicators**:
  - Rising ventilatory efficiency for oxygen despite a plateau for carbon dioxide.
  - Respiratory Exchange Ratio > 1.
  - Increase in end-tidal oxygen preceding a fall in end-tidal carbon dioxide.
  - VCO2 crossing over VO2 on the same axis.
  - Increase in VCO2-VO2 gradient above 1.

#### Prognostic Capacity of CPET

- **Low AT**: Indicates inability to sustain metabolic energy requirements post-major noncardiac surgery.
- **Systematic review findings**:
  - VO2peak and AT associated with survival following hepatic transplant and resection, AAA repair, and intra-abdominal surgery.
  - Definitions of prognostic VO2peak and AT thresholds vary.
  - Inability to determine AT during CPET is a poor prognostic sign.

#### Perioperative Management Based on CPET Results

- **AT < 10-11 ml/kg/min**: Clinically significant.
- **Early myocardial ischemia**: Positive result requiring further coronary investigation.
- **CPET results interpretation**: No standardized guidelines, but proposed perioperative management strategies exist.

| CPET Result                                  | Perioperative Management for Major Noncardiac Surgery                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Early myocardial ischemia                    | Preoperative coronary angiography                                     |
| Adequate AT, without myocardial ischemia     | Preoperative statin therapy                                           |
| Adequate AT with late inducible myocardial ischemia | Preoperative statin therapy and beta-blockade                         |
| Poor AT without myocardial ischemia          | Preoperative goal-directed therapy                                    |
| Poor AT with late inducible myocardial ischemia, or unable to reach AT | Consider deferring surgery, offering lesser procedure, or non-surgical management |
