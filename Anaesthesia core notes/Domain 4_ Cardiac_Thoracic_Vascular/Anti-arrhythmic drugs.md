# Vaughan Williams Classification of Anti-arrhythmic Agents

## Class I Antiarrhythmic Drugs

### Channel Effects
- **Sodium Block**: Class I agents bind to sodium channels in their open form, stabilizing the membrane and prolonging the action potential.

### Repolarisation Time
- **Ia: Prolongs**
  - Quinidine
  - Disopyramide
  - Procainamide
- **Ib: Shortens**
  - Lignocaine
  - Phenytoin (used in treating ventricular tachycardia VT)
- **Ic: Unchanged**
  - Flecainide (used in treating VT and supraventricular tachycardia SVT)

### Clinical Features
- Effective in treating SVT.
- Marked prolongation of the QT interval.
- Causes hypotension, except disopyramide.
- Rarely used in clinical practice today.

#### Lidocaine (Class Ib Agent)

##### Mechanism of Action
- **Channel Inhibition**: Inhibits the fast sodium current, shortening the action potential in healthy tissue.
- **Binding Affinity**: Preferentially binds to sodium channels with rapid onset-offset kinetics, making it ineffective in atrial arrhythmias due to short action potential duration.
- **Selective Action on Ischaemic Myocardium**: Targets ischaemic myocardium, where more sodium channels are in a refractory state, facilitating selective binding to these channels.
- **Phase 0 Effect**: Binds to open sodium channels during phase 0 with minimal effect on the rate of rise of phase 0. Rapid dissociation from the sodium channel occurs within the time frame of a normal heartbeat, allowing for effective rhythm control.

##### Clinical Use
- **Preferred Myocardium**: Acts on ischaemic myocardium and is most effective in hyperkalaemic conditions.
- **Historical Use**: Historically used for suppressing arrhythmias (VT, VF) post-myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery. It has been largely replaced by amiodarone in these settings.
- **Administration and Metabolism**: Cannot be administered orally due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Has a plasma half-life of 2 hours. Reduced hepatic blood flow, as seen in poor cardiac output states, decreases its clearance, necessitating a slowed infusion rate to prevent toxicity.
  
##### Side Effects
- **CNS Effects**: Predominantly involves CNS stimulation, with signs of toxicity including tremor, drowsiness, confusion, coma, and circumoral paraesthesia.
- **Cardiovascular Effects**: Rare, but can include myocardial depression and vasodilatation, particularly of arterioles.
## Class II Antiarrhythmic Drugs

### Channel Effects
- **Depolarising Current**: Affects phase IV depolarising current via calcium channels.
- **Repolarisation Time**: Unchanged.

### Drug Examples
- **β-blockers**, including sotalol.

### Mechanism of Action
- **Calcium Inward Current Reduction**: At the nodal tissues, β-blockers reduce the inward calcium current, thereby reducing the slope of phase 4 depolarisation.
  - **Esmolol**: Short-acting, metabolised by tissue esterases.
  - **Sotalol**: Exhibits both Class II and Class III actions.

### Arguments for Beta-Blockade Use
- **Tachycardia Prevention**: Beta-blockers mitigate tachycardia, which can help prevent certain arrhythmias.
- **Sympathetic Activity**: They reduce increased sympathetic activity in patients with sustained VT and post-myocardial infarction (MI).
- **cAMP Role**: Beta-blockers inhibit cAMP, a second messenger at the beta-receptor, which plays a role in ischaemia-related ventricular fibrillation (VF).
- **Antihypertensive and Anti-Ischaemic Effects**: They provide beneficial effects in managing hypertension and ischaemia.

### Indications for Beta-Blocker Use
- **Sinus Tachycardia**: Management of unwanted or inappropriate sinus tachycardia.
- **Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia**: Effective in treating paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.
- **Congenital Prolonged QT Syndrome**: Indicated for arrhythmias due to congenital prolonged QT syndrome.
- **Mitral Valve Prolapse**: Useful in arrhythmias related to mitral valve prolapse.

### Additional Notes
- **Propranolol**: Exhibits both Class I and Class II actions.
- **Sotalol**: Exhibits mixed Class II and Class III actions.

## Class III Antiarrhythmic Drugs

### Channel Effects
- **Repolarising K⁺ Current (K channel blockers)**: Blocks potassium channels. Prolong the refractory period and QT interval.
- **Repolarisation Time**: Markedly prolongs.
- **Sotalol and Amiodarone**: Also exhibit Class I, II, and IV actions.
### Drug Examples
- Amiodarone
- Sotalol
- Bretylium
#### Amiodarone

##### Uses
- **Treatment of**:
  - Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)
  - Ventricular tachycardia (VT)
  - Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW)

##### Contraindications
- Severe sinus node dysfunction with marked sinus bradycardia or syncope
- Second and third-degree heart block
- Known hypersensitivity to amiodarone
- Intravenous amiodarone is contraindicated in neonates due to the benzyl alcohol in the preparation, which may cause the fatal "gasping syndrome."

##### Mechanism of Action
- **Potassium Channel Blockade**: The main mechanism is K⁺ channel blockade, leading to slower repolarization, prolonged action potential duration, and a prolonged refractory period.
- **Multi-Class Activity**: Though designed as a Class III drug, amiodarone demonstrates anti-arrhythmic activities of Class I through IV.

##### Pharmacokinetics
- **Absorption**: Poor gut absorption with bioavailability of 50-70%.
- **Distribution**: Protein binding greater than 90%, volume of distribution 2-70 L/kg.
- **Metabolism**: Hepatic metabolism with some active metabolites.
- **Excretion**: Excreted via lacrimal glands, skin, and bile.

##### Side Effects
- **Pulmonary**: Pneumonitis, fibrosis, pleuritis.
- **Endocrine**: Hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism; prevents peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.
- **Liver**: Cirrhosis, hepatitis, jaundice.
- **Other**: Gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity, peripheral neuropathy.

## Class IV Antiarrhythmic Drugs

### Mechanism of Action
- **Calcium Channel Blockers**: AV nodal Ca²⁺ block. These drugs block calcium channels, particularly in the AV node, leading to decreased heart rate and increased conduction time.
- **Repolarisation Time**: Unchanged.
  - **Verapamil**: Negative inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effects.
  - **Diltiazem**: Effects on both smooth muscle and cardiac tissue.
- **Magnesium**: Mimics calcium channel blockers.
- **Adenosine**: Reduces calcium influx by preventing the opening of calcium channels.
#### Verapamil

##### Indications
- Treatment of angina, hypertension, and certain supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs).

##### Mechanism of Action
- **L-isomer**: Blocks SA/AV node calcium channels, increasing conduction time and decreasing heart rate. It also causes vasodilation, reducing blood pressure and myocardial contractility.
- **D-isomer**: Blocks sodium channels, exhibiting local anaesthetic activity.

##### Non-Cardiovascular Effects
- Cerebral vasodilation.

##### Pharmacokinetics
- **Absorption**: Well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, resulting in 20% bioavailability.
- **Protein Binding**: 90%.
- **Metabolism**: Demethylated to norverapamil (active metabolite).
- **Excretion**: 80% via urine, 20% via bile.

#### Adenosine

##### Clinical Uses
1. **Differentiation**: Distinguishes between SVT and VT. In SVT, the heart rate slows; in VT, it does not. SVT due to re-entry circuits may convert to normal sinus rhythm (NSR), while atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AF/F) will not.
2. **Onset of Action**: Acts within seconds with a half-life of 10-30 seconds.

##### Mechanism of Action
- **Receptor Activation**: Binds to A₁ receptors in the SA and AV nodes, opening potassium channels, causing membrane hyperpolarisation.
- **cAMP Reduction**: Via Gi protein, reducing cAMP and causing negative inotropy within the AV node.

##### Side Effects
- Arrhythmia, bronchospasm, chest discomfort.

##### Contraindications
- Asthma, second or third-degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome.

## Other Drugs
### Digoxin

#### Uses
1. Treatment of atrial fibrillation and flutter.

#### Mechanism of Action
- **Indirect Effects**:
  - Increases acetylcholine (ACh) release at muscarinic receptors.
  - Slows conduction and lengthens the refractory period at the AV node, leading to a decreased ventricular rate.
- **Direct Effects**:
  - Inhibits Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase, resulting in increased intracellular sodium.
  - Inhibits the Na⁺-Ca²⁺ exchanger, leading to increased intracellular calcium.
  - This results in increased inotropy, hyperpolarisation, and increased excitability.

#### Pharmacokinetics
- **Absorption**: Variable, with bioavailability around 70%.
- **Distribution**: Protein binding of 25%, with a volume of distribution (Vd) of 5-10 L/kg.
- **Metabolism**: Minimal hepatic metabolism.
- **Excretion**: Mainly excreted unchanged in urine; accumulation occurs in renal failure.

- **Decreased Plasma Levels**: Antacids, cholestyramine, phenytoin, metoclopramide.

# Mechanism of Action

### Action Potentials and Ion Concentrations in Neuronal and Cardiac Tissues

#### Action Potential in Neuronal Tissue

 ![](Pasted%20image%2020240614115322.png)

- **Depolarisation**: Opening of sodium channels allows sodium ions to enter the neuron, causing the membrane potential to become more positive.
- **Repolarisation**: The positive membrane potential stimulates the opening of potassium channels, allowing potassium to leave the neuron, resulting in a small overshoot before returning to resting potential.

#### Figure 2: Action Potential in Cardiac Myocytes

![](Pasted%20image%2020240614115736.png)

- **Phase 0**: Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels open, and Na⁺ enters the cell.
- **Phase 1**: Initial rapid repolarisation as Na⁺ channels close.
- **Phase 2**: Slower, prolonged opening of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels.
- **Phase 3**: Closure of Ca²⁺ channels and K⁺ efflux.
- **Phase 4**: Cell membrane becomes permeable to K⁺ ions but remains relatively impermeable to other ions.

## Normal Membrane Potentials

### Steady State Distribution of Ions in the Intraand Extracellular Compartments of Cardiac Myocytes

|Ion|Extracellular Concentration (mmol/L)|Intracellular Concentration (mmol/L)|
|---|---|---|
|Na⁺|135-145|10|
|K⁺|3.5-5.0|155|
|Cl⁻|95-110|20-30|
|Ca²⁺|2|10⁻⁴|

### Diagram of the Membrane Potential for Pacemaker Tissue

![](Pasted%20image%2020240614115931.png)

- **Pre-Potential**: The pre/pacemaker potential triggers the next impulse. At the peak of each impulse, K⁺ efflux causes repolarisation. As K⁺ efflux slows, the membrane begins to depolarise, forming the first part of the prepotential.
- **Calcium Channels**: Initially, T-type (transient) calcium channels open, completing the pre-potential. This is followed by the opening of L-type (long-lasting) calcium channels, producing the impulse.

## Potassium and Sodium Movement

![](Pasted%20image%2020240614120036.png)

#### Phases of Cardiac Action Potential

1. **Phase 0 (Depolarization)**
	
	- **Ionic Movement**: Rapid influx of Na⁺ ions through voltage-gated Na⁺ channels (I_Na).
	- **Voltage Change**: Rapid rise in membrane potential from -90 mV to approximately +20 mV.
2. **Phase 1 (Initial Repolarization)**
	
	- **Ionic Movement**: Transient outward K⁺ current (I_to) briefly flows out of the cell.
	- **Voltage Change**: Slight decrease in membrane potential following the peak of depolarization.
3. **Phase 2 (Plateau Phase)**
	
	- **Ionic Movement**: Slow influx of Ca²⁺ ions through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (I_CaL) balanced by K⁺ efflux (I_Kr, I_Ks).
	- **Voltage Change**: Membrane potential remains relatively stable, forming a plateau.
4. **Phase 3 (Repolarization)**
	
	- **Ionic Movement**: Continued efflux of K⁺ ions through delayed rectifier K⁺ channels (I_Kr, I_Ks).
	- **Voltage Change**: Gradual return of the membrane potential towards the resting level.
5. **Phase 4 (Resting Membrane Potential)**
	
	- **Ionic Movement**: Maintenance of the resting membrane potential primarily by K⁺ currents.
	- **Voltage Change**: Membrane potential stabilizes at around -90 mV.

#### Ionic Currents

- **I_Na (Sodium Current)**: Responsible for the rapid depolarization during phase 0.
- **I_to (Transient Outward Potassium Current)**: Contributes to the initial repolarization in phase 1.
- **I_CaL (L-type Calcium Current)**: Maintains the plateau phase during phase 2 by allowing a slow influx of Ca²⁺.
- **I_Kr, I_Ks (Delayed Rectifier Potassium Currents)**: Facilitate repolarization during phase 3 by allowing K⁺ efflux.
