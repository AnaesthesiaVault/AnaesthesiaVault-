# Approach for Awake intubation/ Tracheostomy

## Lignocaine Recipe
**Dosage:** Up to 9 ml/kg lean body mass
**Goal:** 4% lignocaine with 20 mcg/ml adrenaline for airway topicalization

**Ingredients:**
- 10% lignocaine ('Remicard 10% in SA)
- 1 mg/ml adrenaline (1:1000) diluted to 100 mcg/ml in a 10 ml syringe
- Two 10 ml normal saline ampoules

**Preparation:**
1. In a 10 ml syringe:
   - Add 4 ml of 10% lignocaine
   - Add 2 ml of the adrenaline mix (100 mcg/ml, total 200 mcg)
   - Add saline to a total volume of 10 ml
2. Resulting mixture: 4% lignocaine with 20 mcg/ml adrenaline

**Application:**
- 5 ml in nebulizer mask
- Split remaining 5 ml into two 10 ml syringes for spray as you go (5 ml air in each)
## Plan
1. **Nebulize** in preoperative area.
2. **Setup:**
   - IVI with clave, give glycopyrrolate
   - Oxymetazoline drops in each nostril
3. **Procedure:**
   - Post-nebulization: insert Remicaine-covered pus swabs into nasopharynx while setting up monitors
   - Start sedation as soon as possible
   - Optionally insert a Remicaine-covered NPA in the chosen nostril (patient to insert)
   - If tolerated, insert size 6.5 armored ETT (or size 6.5 or 7 softened north-facing), covered in Remicaine
   - If tolerated, pass flexible scope down ETT until vocal cords are visible (bypassing nasopharynx navigation)
   - Spray lignocaine generously upon visualizing larynx and vocal cords (warn patient about coughing)
   - Pass scope through cords, bolus propofol, and pass ETT tube
   - If ETT in nose not tolerated, pass scope through nostrils/nasopharynx until vocal cords are visible, spray as you go, pass scope through cords, bolus propofol, and pass tube
4. **Final Steps:**
   - Connect to circuit and confirm capnography
   - Induce patient with propofol and give muscle relaxant
   - Inflate the ETT cuff after induction
# Tracheostomy

## Considerations
- Shared airway and potential difficult airway
- Close communication with surgeon, backup plan discussed
- Assess indication for tracheostomy and concomitant injuries (traumatic brain injury, C-spine injury)
- Potentially critically ill patient with limited reserve, multi-organ failure
## Potential Catastrophic Complications
- Loss of airway, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, aspiration, false passage/tracheal disruption
- Airway fire (mitigate with low FiO2 and limited cautery use)
## Goals & Conflicts
- **Optimize underlying disease state:**
  - Assess stability for elective tracheostomy (high FiO2 & ventilator support, high-dose inotropes/vasopressors, raised ICP, severe volume overload, coagulopathy/DIC)
- **Surgical Plan:**
  - Discuss with backups and additional equipment
- **Aspiration Risk Reduction:**
  - Ensure NPO status, apply gastric suction
- **Motionless Surgical Field:**
  - Ensure paralysis
- **Oxygen Requirements:**
  - Balance low FiO2 for fire protection vs. high FiO2 requirements
## Considerations for Patients with Tracheostomy
- **Difficult Airway:**
  - Difficult BMV & supraglottic device ventilation due to air leak
  - Prefer direct vision for ETT placement
- **Indications for Tracheostomy:**
  - Pulmonary toilet, respiratory failure/chronic ventilation, threatened airway, aspiration risk
- **Comorbid Diseases:**
  - ICU patients with multi-organ failure, sepsis, lung injury
  - Neuromuscular disorders, chronic high spinal cord injury
- **Complications of Long-term Tracheostomy:**
  - Tracheoinnominate fistula, suctioning injuries, trachea/stoma site infection/bleeding, laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, tracheal rupture, tracheal stenosis
## Emergency Tracheostomy Equipment
- Various sizes of cuffed/uncuffed tracheostomy tubes
- Suction catheters, graspers, ambubag, and ties
