# Pharmacodynamics: Basic Principles

### Mechanism of Action

- Describes the biochemical interaction between a drug and the organism. Drugs do not induce new functions in tissues; they alter the rate or strength of existing functions.

### Enzyme Interactions

- Drug molecules selectively bind to naturally occurring catalysts.
	- Chemical binding alters the enzyme interaction with normal target molecules to increase or, more commonly, decrease reaction rates.

### Receptor Interactions

- Drug molecules selectively bind to reactive sites on cell surfaces.

#### Agonists

- Bind to cell receptors to increase function.

#### Competitive Antagonists

- Bind to cell receptors to block agonists and decrease function. Can be overcome with increased agonist concentration.

#### Non-Competitive Antagonists

- Alter conformation of receptors to block agonists and decrease function. Cannot be overcome with increased agonist concentration.

### Non-Selective Interactions

- Drug molecules physically interfere with or chemically alter cellular structures and processes.
	- Drugs mimic substrates in naturally occurring reactions. Resulting products are incomplete or unstable.

### Pharmacokinetics

- Alterations in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion change effects of a given dose.

### Key Terms

#### Efficacy (E_max)

- The maximum response to a drug produced in randomized control trials.

#### Potency (EC_50)

- The concentration of a drug required to produce 50% of E_max.

#### Toxic Dose 50% (ED_50)

- The dose which results in an adverse effect in 50% of the sample population.

#### Effective Dose 50% (ED_50)

- The dose which results in a therapeutic effect in 50% of the sample population.

#### Therapeutic Index (TI)

- Describes a margin of safety between the effective and toxic dose. TI = TD50/ED50.

# Pharmacokinetics

### Absorption

- Describes the movement of a drug from the site of administration to systemic circulation. Bioavailability refers to the proportion of unaltered drug that reaches systemic circulation.

#### Parenteral

- Injections into tissues or directly into vasculature.
- Topical absorption via epidermis or alveolar surfaces (inhaled).

#### Enteral

- Buccal/sublingual absorption → internal jugular veins.
- Rectal administration → absorption to the superior and inferior rectal veins. These lead to portal and systemic circulation respectively.
- PO intake → absorption via the small bowel to the portal circulation.
	- 1st Pass Effect: Refers to hepatic metabolism of a drug prior to entering systemic circulation, decreasing bioavailability, activating pro-drugs, or converting to another active or toxic metabolite.

### Distribution

- Describes the transportation of a drug through the circulatory system to tissue and fluid compartments. Volume of distribution refers to the amount of drug in the body + plasma drug concentration.

### Metabolism

- Describes the biochemical alteration of a drug.
	- Biotransformation by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

### Excretion

- Describes the removal of a drug from the body.
	- Active tubular secretion of free and protein-bound drug.
	- Passive glomerular filtration of free drug.
	- Excretion of lipophilic drug metabolites in bile.
	- Reabsorption in the small bowel.
	- Excretion of drugs via urine and/or feces.

### Half Life

- Describes the length of time for the serum drug level to decrease by 50%. Steady state is reached after ~5 half-lives.

# General
**Summation**: Two drugs are additive, but have independent actions.
**Potentiation**: Action of one drug is amplified by another drug that has no independent action of its own.
**Synergism**: The combined action of two drugs is greater than expected.

	- Results in transient adrenal steroid insufficiency, increasing morbidity and mortality in trauma/critically ill patients (contraindicated in sepsis).
- Inhibits nitric oxide signaling.
	
	- Transient cerebral vasoconstriction, decreasing cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate, and electrical activity in the brain.
	- Increases hemodynamic stability (minimal changes in blood pressure or heart rate).
	- Decreases intracranial pressure.
- Binds to GABA_A (inhibitory CNS neurotransmitter) receptor.
	
	- Positively modulates GABA_A receptor.
	- Higher selectivity for specific GABA_A receptor subtypes compared to other induction agents.
	- Increases spontaneous CNS neuron firing to skeletal muscle, leading to involuntary muscle contractions (myoclonus).
	- Prolonged opening of GABA_A receptors (acts as ion channel for chloride).
	- Influx of chloride causes hyperpolarization of nerve membranes in the reticular activating system, inhibiting nerve cell activity, resulting in induction of general anesthesia without analgesic effect, and causing depression of arousal and loss of consciousness.
	- Activation of peripheral nociceptor receptors, leading to stinging pain with injection (treated with co-administration of local anesthetic).
- Direct activation of TRPA1 cation channels (key receptor in pain pathway).

	- Lipaemic plasma 
	- Clinically enlarged liver
### Features
**Early markers:**

- Contraindicated in patients with traumatized, denervated, or immobilized muscles due to risk of cardiac arrest from hyperkalemia.
### Scoline Apnea

### Pathophysiology

- **Acquired:**
	
	- Drugs (anticholinesterases): Break down or inhibit pseudocholinesterase enzyme, decreasing pseudocholinesterase activity.
	- Malignancy: Abnormal gene expression decreases protein synthesis.
	- Liver disease: Decreases liver's ability to synthesize proteins, decreasing pseudocholinesterase synthesis by the liver.
	- Malnutrition: Decreases molecular precursors for protein production.
	- Renal disease: Mechanism unclear.
	- Fluid overload: Hemodilution of circulating proteins.
- **Hereditary:**
	
	- BChE (Butyrylcholinesterase) gene mutation: Decreases production or production of non-functional pseudocholinesterase by the liver.

### Effects

- Impaired ability to hydrolyze ester linkages of substrates like neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., succinylcholine, mivacurium, diamorphine, acetylsalicylic acid, methylprednisolone, cocaine, heroin).
	- Increases patient's susceptibility to side effects from drugs with ester linkages.

### Anesthetic Considerations

- Prolonged binding of neuromuscular blocking agent to nicotinic cholinergic receptors in neuromuscular junctions.
	- Prolonged depolarization of skeletal muscle, preventing repolarization and additional action potentials, resulting in extended muscle paralysis and/or anesthesia.

### Note

- Pseudocholinesterase has many synonymous names including butyrylcholinesterase, BChE, BuChE, plasma esterase, plasma cholinesterase, and serum cholinesterase.

### Drugs Administered

- **Mivacurium:**
	
	- Competitively binds to acetylcholine nicotinic receptor.
	- Active site of post-synaptic acetylcholine receptor is blocked.
	- Acetylcholine cannot act on receptor, skeletal muscle cannot depolarize, resulting in skeletal muscle paralysis.
- **Succinylcholine:**
	
	- Irreversibly binds to acetylcholine nicotinic receptor.
	- Continuous depolarization of skeletal muscle.
	- Skeletal muscle unable to repolarize, acetylcholine released cannot trigger an action potential, resulting in skeletal muscle paralysis.

### Complications

# Local Anaesthetics

## Local Anesthetics (Lidocaine, Bupivacaine, Ropivacaine, Procaine, Cocaine)

### Mechanism of Action and Pharmacodynamics

### Classification

- **Ester Class:**
	
	- Cocaine, Procaine.
- **Amide Class:**
	
	- Lidocaine, Ropivacaine, Bupivacaine.

### Addition of a Vasoconstrictor (e.g., Epinephrine)

- Local vasoconstriction at the site of anesthetic infiltration.
	- Decreases systemic absorption of the anesthetic.
	- Increases anesthesia duration.
	- Decreases bleeding at the site of infiltration.
	- Larger amounts of local anesthetic can be safely administered.

### pH Adjustment

- Increasing pH of injected solution (e.g., adding sodium bicarbonate).
	- Decreases pKa of local anesthetic.
	- Increases unprotonated form of local anesthetic.
	- Increases uptake of anesthetic into neurons.
	- Shortens onset time.

### Local Infiltration

- Diffusion of the drug into tissue.
	- When the tertiary amine of the anesthetic is unprotonated, it is lipophilic and can diffuse across nerve cell lipid membranes.
	- Anesthetic molecule becomes protonated within the neuron.
	- Protonated anesthetic binds to the transmembrane sodium channel.
	- Sodium channels become impermeable to sodium ions, preventing movement across the membrane.
	- Decreases nociceptive neuronal depolarization.
	- Decreases pain sensation.

### Structural Traits

- Aliphatic side chains and lipophilic linkages.
	- High molecular weight.
	- High lipophilicity.
	- Increases anesthetic diffusion through nerve sheaths.
	- Increases anesthetic potency.

### Differential Nerve Blockade

- Anesthetics' effect differs based on neuronal features.
	- Small diameter neurons (e.g., unmyelinated nociceptive neurons) have fewer sodium channels for anesthetic to inhibit, thus blocking pain sensation more quickly than motor function.
	- Unmyelinated neurons allow anesthetic to diffuse freely anywhere along the neuron.

## Side Effects and Complications of Local Anesthetics

### Classification

- **Ester Class:**
	
	- Cocaine, Procaine.
- **Amide Class:**
	
	- Ropivacaine, Bupivacaine, Lidocaine.

### Molecular Structure

- Both classes contain a lipophilic aromatic ring and a hydrophilic tertiary amine, making them amphipathic molecules.

### Metabolism

- **Ester Local Anesthetics:**
	
	- Metabolized by plasma cholinesterases.
	- Impaired breakdown in patients with atypical pseudocholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase deficiency, leading to prolonged clearance and increased duration of anesthetic blockade.
- **Amide Local Anesthetics:**
	
	- Metabolized in the liver by hepatic enzymes.
	- Impaired breakdown in patients with liver disease, leading to prolonged clearance and increased duration of anesthetic blockade.

### Local Infiltration

- Diffuses into sympathetic nerves, blocking sodium channels on neuronal membranes and inhibiting sympathetic nerve function.
	
	- Decreases vasoconstrictive signals to vascular smooth muscle.
	- Causes vasodilation of systemic arteries, leading to hypotension.
- Some local anesthetic may enter systemic circulation and reach the heart, blocking ion channels on cardiac myocytes.
	
	- If enough anesthetic reaches cardiac myocytes, their action decreases myocardial electrical signaling and thus decreases cardiac rhythm and contractility.
	- Can result in cardiac arrest.

## Bupivacaine Vs Ropivacaine

# Paracetamol

## Dosing Guideline

- **Standard Dose for Adults Over 50 kg:**
	
	- 1 g up to four times a day.
	- Minimum 4 hours between each administration.
	- 6 hours between doses for those with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 ml/min).
- **Weight-Adjusted Dosing:**

	- Suggested regimen based on pharmacokinetic data: Single loading dose of 2 g, followed by 1 g doses every 4–6 hours.
- **Postoperative Analgesia:**
	
	- Studies show lower pain scores and greater duration of effective pain relief with a 2 g loading dose compared to 1 g, with no increase in side effects or toxicity markers.

## Pharmacokinetics

- **Administration:**
	
	- Oral: Tablets, capsules, syrup.
	- Rectal.
	- IV: Perfalgan®.
- **Bioavailability:**
	
	- Oral: 80%.
	- IV: 100% bioavailability with predictable onset of action (OOA) within 15 minutes and peak effect within 1 hour.
	- Oral and rectal routes have lower bioavailability and unpredictable absorption and OOA.
- **Peak Plasma Levels After Administration:**
	
	- Tablets: 1 - 2 hours.
	- Syrup: 30 minutes.
	- IV: 15 minutes after infusion completed.
- **Elimination Half-life (t₁/₂):**
	
	- 1.5 - 3 hours.
- **Volume of Distribution:**

- **Protein Binding:**
	
	- 10%.
- **Metabolism:**
	
	- Hepatic.
- **Excretion:**
	
	- Renal, sulfate, and glucuronide metabolites.

## Mechanism of Action

- **Prostaglandin Inhibition:**
	
	- Inhibits prostaglandin H₂ synthetase at the cyclooxygenase (COX) and peroxidase (POX) sites.
	- Reduces the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G₂.
	- Inhibits the subsequent conversion of prostaglandin G₂ to prostaglandin H₂.
	- This reduces the levels of downstream prostaglandins (PGE₂, PGI₂, TXA₂).
- **Endocannabinoid Reuptake Inhibition:**
	
	- Metabolized to p-aminophenol.
	- p-Aminophenol is converted to AM404 in the brain.
	- AM404 inhibits the reuptake of anandamide, an endogenous cannabinoid, contributing to analgesic effects.
- **Serotonergic Pathway:**
	
	- Involves descending pain pathways from brainstem nuclei, hypothalamus, and cortex interacting with pain afferents in the dorsal horn.
	- Serotonin receptors, especially 5-HT3, are involved in consciousness, mood, memory, and nausea/vomiting.
	- Activation of descending serotonergic pathways is key to paracetamol's action.
	- Antinociceptive effects can be partially inhibited by co-administration of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists, frequently given with paracetamol perioperatively.
- **Endocannabinoid Enhancement:**
	
	- Paracetamol (via p-aminophenol) conjugates with arachidonic acid to form AM404.
	- AM404 inhibits anandamide reuptake, increasing cannabinoid receptor activation.
	- Contributes to relaxation, tranquility, and euphoria, independent of analgesia.
	- AM404 also activates TRPV1, and inhibits COX, NO, and TNF-alpha, all involved in pain states.
	- Central production of AM404 accounts for antipyretic effects related to inhibition of brain prostaglandin production.

# Statins

## MOA
### Cholesterol-Lowering Effects

- Statins are effective in lowering cholesterol levels in patients.

### Pleiotropic Effects

- **Improved Endothelial Function:**
	
	- Enhances the function of the endothelium, the inner lining of blood vessels.
- **Altered Expression of Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS):**
	
	- Modifies the expression of NOS, which is crucial for the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that helps relax and dilate blood vessels.
- **Inhibits Thrombogenic Response:**
	
	- Reduces the body's tendency to form blood clots.
- **Platelet Inhibition:**
	
	- Inhibits platelet aggregation, decreasing the risk of clot formation.
- **Reduced Vascular Inflammation:**
	
	- Lowers inflammation within the blood vessels, which can contribute to atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases.
- **Stabilization of Atherosclerotic Plaques:**
	
	- Helps stabilize plaques in the arteries, reducing the risk of plaque rupture and subsequent cardiovascular events.
- **Reduction in Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE):**
	
	- Statins have been associated with a 19% reduction in the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events.

## Equivalent Doses of Different Steroids

|Glucocorticoid|Equivalent Dose|Anti-inflammatory Activity (Relative to Hydrocortisone)|Duration of Action|
|---|---|---|---|
|Hydrocortisone (Cortisol)|20 mg|1|8-12 hours|
|Prednisolone/Prednisone|5 mg|4|12-36 hours|

# Dexmedetomidine

### Mechanism of Action
- **Arousal Effects:**
  - Acts on presynaptic α2 adrenergic receptors projecting from the locus ceruleus.
  - Binds to α2 receptors, hyperpolarizing locus ceruleus neurons, decreasing norepinephrine release.
  
- **Burst Suppression:**
  - Rarely associated with burst suppression (a profound state of anesthetic-induced brain inactivation) common with high doses of propofol, barbiturates, or inhaled ether drugs.
- **Sedation:**
  - Provides sedation with minimal risk of respiratory depression.
  - Commonly used as an anesthetic adjunct in the operating room due to easy arousability of patients.
  - Procedural sedation associated EEG pattern resembles nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stage III or slow-wave sleep, characterized by slow/delta oscillations.
- **Detailed MOA:**
  - Blocks norepinephrine (NE) release from neurons projecting from the locus ceruleus (LC) to various brain areas:
	- Preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus.
	- Basal forebrain (BF).
	- Intralaminar nucleus (ILN) of the thalamus.
	- Cortex.
  - Hyperpolarization of locus ceruleus neurons results in loss of inhibitory inputs to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, activating inhibitory pathways from the preoptic area to arousal centers, leading to decreased arousal.
  - Loss of excitatory inputs from the locus ceruleus to the basal forebrain, intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus, and cortex decreases thalamocortical connectivity, enhancing the sedative effect.

### SASSA Recommendations for Use
1. Does not support any specified limitations.
2. Encourages responsible, sparing use in patients who will specifically benefit.
3. Dose should be guided by Neuromuscular Transmission (NMT) monitoring.
4. Does not encourage routine use due to unsustainability in South Africa.
5. Advocates the use of Neo/AC for the majority of patients.
6. Continued practice in the patient's best interest, both clinically and financially.
7. Recommends ready availability at all facilities.

# Albumin

### Manufacturing
- **Process:**
  - Produced through the Cohn cold ethanol fractionation process.
  - Resulting in a sterile aqueous solution of albumin obtained from large pools of adult human venous plasma.

### Functions
- **Binding and Transport:**
  - Binds and transports drugs and endogenous molecules, such as bilirubin, fatty acids, bile salts, steroids, and acidic drugs (e.g., Warfarin, aspirin, furosemide, amiodarone).
  
- **Oncotic Pressure:**
  - Accounts for 80% of intravascular oncotic pressure.
- **Free Radical Scavenging:**
  - Acts as a scavenger for free radicals.
- **Acid-Base Balance:**
  - Contributes significantly to the anion gap.
- **Calcium Handling:**
  - Negative charge of albumin binds Ca²⁺, reducing free Ca²⁺ levels.

### Interactions
- **Protein Binding:**
  - Binding of acidic drugs to albumin reduces free drug concentration and increases the volume of distribution (Vd).
  - Hypoalbuminaemia increases free drug levels, while albumin infusions decrease free drug levels.
  - Subject to competition, where one drug's protein binding may reduce another's due to higher affinity, increasing free drug concentration of the latter.
  - Non-competitive allosteric interactions are possible, where one drug causes a conformational change in albumin, displacing another drug.
- **Examples:**
  - Warfarin, aspirin, furosemide, amiodarone.

### Disadvantages
- Expensive.
- Greater need for ventilatory support.
- Negative inotropic effects.
- No ability to decrease cascade activation.
- No data showing reduced morbidity/mortality.

### Contraindications
- Known allergy.
- Cardiac failure.
