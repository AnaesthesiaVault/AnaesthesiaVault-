# Guidelines (Association of Anaesthetists and the British Association of Day Surgery 2019)

## Recommendations

1. Thorough anaesthetist-led, nurse-delivered pre-anaesthetic assessment and preparation, as well as protocol-driven discharge, are fundamental to safe and effective day surgery.
2. Fitness for a procedure should relate to the patient’s functional status rather than ASA physical status.
3. It is possible to undertake most surgery in adults and children as day cases.
4. All day surgery units should have a clinical lead whose responsibilities include the development of local policies, guidelines and clinical governance.
5. All anaesthetists should be familiar with techniques that permit the patient to undergo a procedure with minimum stress and maximum comfort to enable early discharge, including regional nerve blocks and neuraxial blockade, such as spinal anaesthesia.
6. All members of the multidisciplinary team should be trained in day surgery practice.
7. High-quality, age-appropriate advice leaflets, assessment forms, and protocols for specific procedures should be in place.
8. Day surgery should take place within a dedicated unit or area within the main hospital site.
9. Quality assurance and improvement programmes are an essential component of good care in all aspects of day surgery.

## Essential Components

1. Identification of appropriate procedures.
2. Identification of a theatre list that can reliably accommodate the procedure (e.g., a dedicated day surgery list or a flexibly run emergency theatre list).
3. Ensuring clear pathways are in place.
4. Determining whether the condition is safe to be left untreated for up to 24 h and manageable at home with oral analgesia.
5. Providing clear pre-operative patient information, ideally in writing.

# Introduction

## Definition
- Defined as a patient being admitted to hospital for a planned procedure and discharged home the same calendar day. This typically incorporates a stay of 4–6 h.

## Benefit
- Shorter hospital stays and early mobilization reduce rates of hospital-acquired infection and venous thromboembolism.

## Types of Operations Suitable for Day case Surgery

**Breast Surgery:**
- Excision of breast
- Simple mastectomy
- Sentinel node biopsy
- Axillary clearance

**Gynaecology:**
- Operations to manage female incontinence

**Urology:**
- Endoscopic resection of prostate (TURP)
- Resection of prostate by laser

**General Surgery:**

## The Day Surgery Pathway

1. **Patient listed for a procedure suitable for day surgery**
   - Minimize this time
2. **Nurse-based preoperative assessment**
3. **Patient fit for surgery**
   - Optimization
4. **Anaesthetic review**
   - If unsuitable for day surgery:
	 - Consider:
	   - LA procedure
	   - Is surgery necessary?
	   - Inpatient pathway
   - If suitable:
	 - Patient given day surgery operation date with operative information and preoperative instructions
5. **Day of admission**
   - Routine preoperative checks
6. **Day surgery procedure**
7. **Discharge with analgesia, postoperative information, and instructions**
8. **Telephone follow-up**

## Patient Selection

### 3 Questions
1. Is the operation an appropriate day-case procedure?
2. Is there anything we would do for this patient by admitting them overnight which could not be done at home?
3. Are the patient’s home circumstances adequate for day surgery discharge?

### Medical Factors
- Patient’s fitness for day surgery should be judged by functional assessment at the time of preoperative assessment.
- There are few medical conditions, once fully optimized, which would exclude a patient from day surgery.
- Stable chronic conditions: Continue management.
- Unstable chronic conditions: Consider if appropriate. Exclude only unstable chronic conditions, until optimized.
- Obesity: Morbid obesity not a contraindication.
- Elderly: No upper limit of age. Inpatient surgery can trigger disorientation => DCS preferred in elderly.
- Paediatrics: Full-term infants over 1 month are generally appropriate to have a day surgery procedure but in ex-premature infants, a higher age limit (60 weeks post-conceptual age) is advised owing to the increased risk of postoperative apnoea. Day surgery is particularly appropriate for children.
- ASA: ASA grade is not a useful assessment for day surgery suitability with ASA III patients reporting no increase in postoperative complications than ASA I or II.

### Exclusion
**Patient:**
- Premature infants <50 weeks post-conception
- OSA (relative)
- Complex congenital heart disease
- Inadequately controlled systemic disease
- Active infection

**Procedure:**
- >1 hour
- Risk of perioperative haemorrhage
- Body cavity surgery
- Inexperienced surgeon

**Anaesthesia:**
- Inexperienced anaesthetist
- Difficult airway
- MH risk/history (relative)
- Postoperative pain (uncontrolled by simple analgesia)

**Family/social:**
- No parental support
- No telephone
- >1 hour journey home
- No transport

#### Diabetes
1. Screen for undiagnosed DM in high-risk patients according to the SEMDSA guidelines.
2. Evaluate the patient's capacity to manage the disease, chronic control, and invasiveness of the surgery.
3. HbA1c: Postpone elective surgery if >8.5%.
4. Examine for TOD / DAN.
5. Optimize pre-op glycaemic control.
6. Planning of peri-op glycaemic control regimen (modification vs VRII - see relevant card).

##### Day Case Considerations
- Patients physically, mentally, and socio-economically able to manage their DM.
- Access to emergency healthcare.
- HbA1c <8.5%.
- Nature of the surgery.

### Social Factors
- 24 h home care: It is generally recommended that after a general anaesthetic, most patients should have a responsible adult to accompany them home and remain with them for 24 h after surgery (this requirement is beginning to be challenged after very minor surgery).
- Traditionally, this has excluded those patients living alone from day surgery. Some units, however, now deploy carers to patient’s homes to stay overnight, enabling even these patients to be treated as day cases.
- Access to a telephone.
- Geographical proximity to the hospital; travelling time >1 hour may be contraindication for certain procedures (e.g., day-case tonsillectomy).
- The patient must understand, engage with, and consent to the surgical procedure and for it to be performed as day surgery.

### Surgical Factors
- The procedure should not have a significant risk of major postoperative complications necessitating immediate medical intervention (haemorrhage, cardiovascular instability).
- No prolonged specialist postoperative care or observation required.
- Abdominal and thoracic cavities should only be opened with minimally invasive techniques.
- Postoperative pain should be controllable with oral analgesia + regional anaesthesia techniques.
- Patient should be able to rapidly resume normal functions (oral nutrition, safe mobilization).
- Urgent procedures are also appropriate for a semi-elective day-case pathway, for example, drainage of abscesses, some trauma surgery.

# Anaesthesia for Day Case Surgery

## Pre-operative Phase

### Patient Education and Information
1. **Education**: Inform patients and carers about day surgery pathways.
2. **Informed Decisions**: Provide verbal and written information about planned procedures and postoperative care to aid informed decision-making.
3. **Medical Risk Factors**: Identify and optimize any medical conditions before surgery.

### Patient Information Delivery
- Limited time is available to convey comprehensive preoperative preparation, surgical procedure, anaesthesia, and postoperative recovery information.
- Verbal instructions should be reinforced at multiple stages:
  - Primary care
  - Surgical outpatient clinic
  - Preoperative assessment
  - Admission
  - Discharge

## Intraoperative Phase

### Objectives
- Ensure rapid onset and offset of anaesthesia with clear-headed emergence.
- Minimize postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), dizziness, or drowsiness, and ensure a rapid return to full cognitive function.

### Monitoring and Assistance
- Follow established guidelines for patient monitoring and assistance.

### Analgesia
- Use short-acting agents with minimal side effects to facilitate a rapid return to recovery.
- Multimodal analgesia (MMA) is recommended.
- Avoid morphine if possible; consider regional blocks.
- Postoperative analgesia options: Paracetamol, NSAIDs, Codeine, oral Morphine.

### Neuraxial Techniques
- Utilize low-dose, short-acting local anaesthetics (e.g., Prilocaine).
- Allow mobilization once peri-anal sensation (S4-5), foot plantar flexion, and big toe proprioception return.
- Note: Ensure appropriate post-spinal analgesia.

### General Considerations
- Prophylaxis for PONV and venous thromboembolism (VTE).
- Maintain patient warmth and minimize starvation.
- Use fluids judiciously.

### Recovery and Discharge
- Recovery room should be adjacent to the operating theatre.
- Establish clear discharge criteria.
- Provide written information to carers about postoperative expectations, including the duration of residual block.

## Postoperative Recovery and Discharge

### Phases of Recovery
- **Phase I**: Early recovery from the end of anaesthesia until the return of protective reflexes and motor function.
- **Phase II**: Achievement of recovery milestones and discharge criteria.

# Paediatric Considerations

## Caudal Anaesthesia
- Caudal anaesthesia can be used in paediatric patients.
- Use low-dose Bupivacaine 0.125% to avoid motor block.
- Optionally, add Clonidine (1-2 mcg/kg) to double the duration of the block.
