# Marfan Syndrome

## Marfan Syndrome: Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

### Pathogenesis

1. **Genetic Mutation**
	- Inherited or acquired mutation in _TGFBR1/2_ gene (TGF-β receptor)
	- Inherited (autosomal dominant) or de novo mutation in _FBN1_ gene

2. **Biochemical Changes**
	- Production of aberrant or reduced fibrillin-1
	- Inability of fibrillin-1 to sequester and inactivate TGF-β1
	- Increased TGF-β1 signaling

3. **Tissue Changes**
	- Formation of unstable microfibrils in extracellular matrix of connective tissues
	- Increased production of matrix metalloproteinases
	- Degradation of extracellular matrix
	- Abnormalities in connective tissues (e.g., diminished and disorganized dural elastic fibers)
	- Thinning of the aortic media
	- Weakness of the aortic wall

### Clinical Findings

1. **Dural Ectasia**
	- Distortion of neural roots leading to back pain and sensory/motor deficits

2. **Ocular Findings**
	- Ectopia lentis (lens dislocation)
	- Myopia

3. **Pulmonary Findings**
	- Development of lung bullae and blebs
	- Rupture of bullae/blebs leading to pneumothorax

4. **Skeletal Findings**
	- Scoliosis
	- Tall stature
	- Chest wall (pectus) deformities
	- Joint hypermobility
	- Thumb and wrist signs (thumb extends from palm, overlap of thumb and fifth finger when grasping opposite wrist)

5. **Cardiovascular Findings**
	- Aortic root dilation
	- Aortic dissection (Type A and B)
	- Mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation
	- Aneurysmal dilation of abdominal/thoracic aorta
	- Aortic rupture and stroke

## Clinical Manifestations and Anaesthetic Implications of MFS

### Ocular System

- **Anaesthetic Implications**: Increased risk of ocular injury
- **Management**: Careful ocular protection and padding

### Musculoskeletal System

- **Clinical Features**: Tall stature, increased arm span, arachnodactyly, scoliosis, pectus deformity, elongated face, high-arched palate, joint hypermobility, protrusio acetabula, pes planus
- **Anaesthetic Implications**:
	- Ventilatory complications, challenging regional anaesthesia (RA)
	- Difficult airway management
	- Joint subluxation and dislocation
	- Risk of accidental dural puncture
- **Management**:
	- Careful airway assessment and planning
	- Ensure careful handling and positioning
	- Consider MRI for identification and delineation

### Cardiovascular System

- **Clinical Features**: Aortic root dilatation, aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse, aortic valve regurgitation, tricuspid valve prolapse, dilatation of main pulmonary artery, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension
- **Anaesthetic Implications**: Increased risk of aortic dissection, morbidity, and mortality

	- Continue β-blockers
	- Obtain pressor response on intubation and extubation

### Pulmonary System

- **Clinical Features**: Spontaneous pneumothorax, emphysema
- **Anaesthetic Implications**: Lung-protective ventilation strategies

## Considerations

- **Airway Problems**:
	- Possibly difficult: high-arched palate
	- Potential cervical spine (C1/2) ligamentous instability
	- TMJ laxity & potential dislocation with laryngoscopy
- **Multisystem Disease**:
	- **Cardiovascular Dysfunction**:
		- Valvular disease (AI, MR, MVP)
		- Aortic arch aneurysm, aortic rupture & dissection risk
		- MIs secondary to medial necrosis of the coronary arterioles
		- Arrhythmias & conduction defects
	- **Respiratory Dysfunction**:
		- Scoliosis, pectus carinatum/excavatum & restrictive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale
		- Spontaneous pneumothorax (bullous lung disease), emphysema
	- **Ocular**: lens dislocation, retinal detachment, glaucoma
- **Potentially Difficult Positioning & Regional Anesthesia**:

- Establish airway with minimal c-spine movement
- Maintain hemodynamic goals of associated valvular lesions
- Lung protective ventilation considering restrictive lung disease & potential bullae
- Careful positioning (lax joints & potential peripheral nerve injury)
- Post-op pain (neuraxial or regional preferably), post-op disposition
- Elective aortic repair indicated when diameter is ≥ 5 cm

## Potential Conflicts

- Coexisting aortic root dilation (need to reduce cardiac output) vs MR/AI/LV dysfunction

## Pregnancy Considerations

- If no symptoms & aorta diameter < 4 cm → no special considerations & vaginal delivery ok
- If aortic root dilatation/AI → multidisciplinary management with cardiology/cardiac surgery/obstetrics
- Cesarean section recommended for aortic diameter > 4.5 cm, labor if > 4 & < 4.5 cm
- **Issues**:
	- Airway might be even more difficult
	- Neuraxial very good option for vaginal delivery & cesarean section
	- Aortic dilatation with risk of dissection/rupture
	- Monthly echocardiography during pregnancy
	- Focus on reducing shear forces on aorta
	- Consider very early epidural
	- Need invasive monitoring
	- Drug therapy to prevent tachycardia & elevated BP (keep systolic < 120 mmHg), labetalol is a good agent
	- Avoid ergotamine due to hypertension risk
- **Dural Ectasia**:
	- Not an absolute contraindication to epidural placement but higher risk for failed block & dural puncture & PDPH
	- Widening of the dural sac, may present with low back pain, headache, or proximal leg pain, weakness, or numbness
	- Consider CT/MRI

# Osteogenesis Imperfecta

## Background
- Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a rare, autosomal dominant, inherited disease of connective tissue that affects bones, sclera, and the inner ear. Bones in individuals with OI are extremely brittle.

## Considerations
- **Difficult airway**:
	- Reduced cervical spine mobility
	- Fragile cervical spine with fracture risk
	- Mandibular fractures
	- Large head and short neck
	- Brittle teeth

	- Succinylcholine-induced fasciculations may cause fractures
- **Bleeding tendency**:
	- Potentially reduced platelet function
- **Hypermetabolic state**:
	- Prone to hyperthermia
	- Not at risk for malignant hyperthermia (MH)

### Conflicts

- **Potential contraindication to regional anesthesia**:
	- Due to platelet dysfunction
	- If patient history is reassuring and platelet count/INR/PTT are within normal limits, regional anesthesia may be considered
# Rheumatoid Arthritis

## Systemic Manifestations

### C-spine
- Erosion of odontoid peg and attenuation of transverse ligament: risk of acute subluxation leading to spinal cord and/or vertebral artery compression
- Amyloidosis of the cervical spine: fixed flexion deformity

### Airway
- Cricoarytenoid joint involvement: shortness of breath (SOB), stridor, hoarseness, laryngeal mass, dysphagia, or neck fullness
- Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) involvement: reduced mouth opening
- Laryngeal amyloidosis or rheumatic nodules: potential laryngeal obstruction
- Fiber optic nasendoscopy advised if there are airway concerns

### Respiratory
- Rheumatoid lung nodules
- Pleural effusions
- Fibrosis
- Reduced chest wall compliance

### Cardiovascular (CVS)
- Pericardial effusions (with or without tamponade)
- Myocarditis
- Pericarditis (restrictive)
- Rheumatic nodules in conduction system
- Pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure
- Raynaud’s phenomenon
- Increased atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD)

### Renal
- Renal dysfunction due to amyloid deposits, vasculitis, or drug treatments

### Hematological
- Anemia of chronic disease
- Bone marrow suppression by treatments
- Iron deficiency anemia (due to peptic ulceration and bleeding)

### Musculoskeletal Changes
- **Cricoarytenoid joint involvement**: dyspnea, stridor, hoarseness, possible severe upper airway obstruction
- **Laryngeal mass**: significant destruction of surrounding structures (also secondary to cricoarytenoid RA)
- **Laryngeal amyloidosis and rheumatoid nodules**: potential laryngeal obstruction
- **TMJ involvement**: limited mouth opening making direct laryngoscopy impossible
- **Atlanto-axial subluxation**
### Cervical Spine Instability
- **Anterior (more common)**: C1 moves forward on C2 due to transverse ligament destruction, causing spinal cord compression. Avoid neck flexion. Keep the upper cervical spine supported while avoiding anterior head movement, e.g., using a doughnut head ring. Direct laryngoscopy should be performed cautiously.
- **Posterior**: C1 moves backward on C2 due to odontoid peg destruction. Avoid neck extension and direct laryngoscopy. Keep the cervical spine flexed. Consider awake tracheal intubation (ATI).
#### Approach to Atlanto-axial Instability
- Indications for X-ray are controversial
- Suggested indications in the literature:
	- Severe disease requiring steroids, methotrexate, and immunosuppressants
	- Obvious symptoms
	- Disease duration greater than 10 years
- On X-ray, a distance from the anterior arch of the atlas to the odontoid process greater than 3 mm confirms atlantoaxial subluxation. This abnormality is critical as the displaced odontoid process can compress the cervical spinal cord or medulla or occlude the vertebral arteries. When atlantoaxial subluxation is present, minimize head and neck movement during direct laryngoscopy to avoid further displacement of the odontoid process and spinal cord damage. Preoperative evaluation should determine if there is interference with vertebral artery blood flow during head and cervical spine movement. This can be assessed by having the awake patient demonstrate tolerated head movements or positioning without discomfort or other symptoms.

### Hepatic
- Increased alpha-1 glycoprotein
- Reduced albumin
- Hepatosplenomegaly
- Hepatic dysfunction secondary to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)

### Neurological
- Peripheral neuropathy (due to compression)
- Autonomic dysfunction

### Ophthalmic
- Dry eyes and mouth (keratoconjunctivitis)

### Skin
- Vasculitis and thin, fragile skin: difficulty inserting and securing intravenous lines

### Immunology
- Immunosuppressive medication: full asepsis required for lines, blocks, epidurals, and catheters
- Steroid supplementation if necessary

### Gastrointestinal (GI)
- Risk of GI bleed with steroids and NSAIDs
- Neuraxial anesthesia is a good choice in RA
- Consider Felty’s syndrome as a complication
## Diagnosis

#### Intraoperative Management
- **Monitoring**:
	- 5-lead electrocardiography
	- Intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring
- **Airway Management**:
	- Use laryngeal mask airway if appropriate
	- Prepare for difficult airway with immediate access to smaller-size endotracheal tubes
- **Medications**:
	- Standard antibiotic prophylaxis
	- Caution with muscle relaxants
	- Renal protective strategies

### Pregnancy Considerations
- Increased risk of preterm labor and intrauterine fetal death
- Multidisciplinary management involving rheumatology, obstetrics, and anesthesia
- Potential coagulopathy may contraindicate the use of neuraxial anesthesia
	- Early hematology consult recommended
	- Increased PTT can be due to:
		- Presence of lupus anticoagulant (clinically safe for neuraxial, patients may be hypercoagulable)
		- Autoantibodies against specific coagulation factors (e.g., VIII, IX, XII) indicating true coagulopathy (neuraxial contraindicated)
- Document any pre-existing central or peripheral sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathies before regional techniques
- Potential for neonatal lupus and congenital heart block

By addressing these considerations, anesthetic management of patients with SLE can be optimized to reduce perioperative risks and ensure a safe outcome.

## Goals & Conflicts

### Airway Management
- Careful and meticulous airway management to avoid trauma to stenotic and friable tissues.
- Emergency lung isolation may be required in the case of massive hemoptysis.

### Neurologic Assessment
- Document neurologic deficits prior to considering regional anesthesia techniques.

### Blood Pressure Management
- Avoid spikes in blood pressure which can lead to aortic dissection or cerebral hemorrhage.
- Premedication to mitigate intubation response while maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP).

### Regional Anesthesia
- Consider regional anesthesia to aid in blood pressure control and permit ongoing neurological assessment.
- Regional anesthesia can help avoid airway manipulation in the presence of upper airway granulomas, tracheal stenoses, and lung nodules.

### Treatment Protocols
- Continue steroid supplementation as required.
- Implement standard deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

## Summary for Wegener's Granulomatosis
1. **Airway Management**
	- Anticipate potential difficult airway due to stenosis and friable tissues.
	- Have emergency lung isolation techniques ready for massive hemoptysis.
  
2. **Neurologic Documentation**
	- Document any pre-existing neurologic deficits prior to regional techniques to ensure accurate assessment post-procedure.

3. **Cardiovascular Monitoring**
	- Implement invasive monitoring with caution due to potential peripheral arteritis.
	- Utilize ultrasound guidance for arterial line placement.

4. **Blood Pressure Management**
	- Avoid hypertensive episodes to prevent catastrophic events like aortic dissection or cerebral hemorrhage.
	- Use premedication to blunt the hemodynamic response to intubation.

5. **Steroid and DVT Prophylaxis**
	- Continue steroid supplementation as per protocol.
	- Implement standard DVT prophylaxis measures to prevent thromboembolic events.

6. **Multidisciplinary Approach**
	- Involve relevant specialists, including pulmonologists, cardiologists, and nephrologists, to optimize perioperative care and management of Wegener's Granulomatosis.
