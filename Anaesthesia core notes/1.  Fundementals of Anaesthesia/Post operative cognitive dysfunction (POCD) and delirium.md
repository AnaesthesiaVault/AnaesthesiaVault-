## Recommended Classification according to Timeline

1. **Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders (NCD - Mild/Major)**:
	- **Delirium (Postoperative)**
	- **Delayed Neurocognitive Recovery (dNCR)**: Days
	- **Neurocognitive Disorder (Postoperative) [NCD]**:
		- Mild (1 to <2 SD)
		- Major (≥2 SD)
		- Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
		- Dementia: 1 month and 12 months
	- **NCD–Mild/Major**: Years
	- **MCI/Dementia**
# Post Operative Cognitive Dysfunction

## Background

- **Formerly Known As**: Post-operative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD)
- **Prevalence**: Approximately 15% of patients over the age of 60 years display an objectively measured decrease in cognitive function as a consequence of anesthesia and surgery.
- **Characteristics**: Subtle cognitive impairment that differs from overt delirium.
- **Syndromes**:
	1. **Delayed Neurocognitive Recovery**: Patient returns to baseline cognitive function by 30 days.
	2. **Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorder**: Cognitive decline persisting up to 12 months postoperatively.
		- **Mild**: Equivalent to mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
		- **Major**: Equivalent to dementia.
- **Pathophysiology**: Thought to be secondary to the inflammatory response to surgery.

## Inflammation and Neurocognitive Dysfunction Pathway

1. **Genetic and Environmental Factors**
2. **Surgery**
3. **Anesthesia**

These factors lead to:

- **Chronic Inflammatory Disease States** ('Priming')
	- **Inflammation**: Phenotypic expression of 'High vs. low inflammatory responders'
		- **Endothelial Dysfunction**: Increased blood-brain barrier permeability
			- 'Priming'
		- **Mediator Release**
		- **Microglial Priming**
		- **Neuro-inflammation**: Increased in vulnerable brain
			- **Oxidative Stress**

The culmination of these processes results in:

- **Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD)**

## Endothelial Dysfunction and Neurocognitive Dysfunction

**Illustrative Process:**

1. **Normal Endothelium**
	- Transition via **Surgical Insult**
2. **Endothelial Injury**
3. **Endothelial Dysfunction**

This progression leads to:

- **Endothelial Dysfunction**:
	- **Disrupted Barrier Function**:
		- Vasospasm
		- Coagulation
		- Leucocyte Adhesion
		- Inflammatory Mediators
		- Haemodynamic Shear Stress

Factors contributing to dysfunction:

- **Surgical Manipulation**:
	- Hypoxia
	- Oxidative Stress

## Considerations

- **Risk Factors**:
	
	- Age > 65, pre-operative cognitive impairment, critically ill, excessive EtOH use, polypharmacy, frailty, history of stroke or TIA, other comorbidities (e.g., DM, vascular disease), lower education level.
	- Major orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery, or otherwise prolonged surgeries.
- **Baseline Cognitive Screening**: Perform a cognitive screen (e.g., MMSSE or Mini-Cog) in suspected patients.
	
- **Monitoring**:
	
	- Use BIS or raw EEG monitor to avoid burst suppression.
	- Employ cerebral oximetry to avoid a drop in rSO2.
- **Anesthetic Technique**: No difference in incidence based on anesthetic technique (GA vs. regional or inhalation vs. IV).

## Goals

- **Identify High-Risk Patients**
- **For High-Risk Patients**:
	- Avoid excessive anesthetic depth (i.e., burst suppression).
	- Avoid prolonged periods of hypotension.
	- Avoid decreases in cerebral oximetry.
	- Avoid benzodiazepines and gabapentinoids.
	- Minimize opioid use.
- **Preventative Strategies**:
	- Block the inflammatory response to stabilize the endothelial blood-brain barrier.
	- Use multimodal analgesia for opioid-sparing effects (e.g., acetaminophen +/- NSAIDs +/- steroids +/- ketamine +/- dexmedetomidine infusion).
	- Employ routine measures to avoid postoperative delirium (e.g., early mobilization, removing drains/restraints/lines).
# Delirium

## Definition
- **Onset:** Within 7 days of anaesthesia and surgery
- **Characteristics:** Inattention and confusion
- **Risks:** Increased risk of dementia, prolonged hospital/ICU stay, increased healthcare costs, and mortality
- **DSM-5 Criteria:**
  - An acute, fluctuating disturbance of consciousness (attention and awareness) and change in cognition
  - Not better explained by pre-existing dementia and not diagnosed in the face of a severely reduced level of arousal

## Background
- **Definition:** Acute, fluctuating alteration in awareness and disturbance of attention
- **Timeline:** Post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) to postoperative day 5 (POD5)
- **Associated Outcomes:** Decreased surgical outcomes, increased length of stay (LOS), functional decline, increased cost, increased mortality
- **Forms:**
  - **Hyperactive:** Classic, well-known type
  - **Hypoactive:** May go unnoticed

## Considerations
- **Risk Factors:**
  - Age > 65
  - Pre-existing cognitive impairment
  - Severe illness
  - Multiple comorbid conditions
  - Hearing/visual impairment
  - Active infection
  - Major surgery
  - Longer surgery duration
- **Pre-operative Assessment:** Essential for identifying at-risk patients

## Prevention
- **Screening:** Conduct delirium screening before PACU discharge
- **Medication Management:** Avoid post-operative deliriogenic medications such as anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and meperidine
- **Environmental Measures:**
  - Frequent reorientation and reassurance
  - Presence of familiar objects in the room
  - Ensure glasses/hearing aids are used as soon as possible
- **Pain Control:** Employ multimodal analgesia for effective pain management
- **Circadian Rhythm:** Maintain normal sleep-wake cycles
- **Restraints:** Eliminate the use of restraints

## Management
- **Prevention Measures:** Implement all aforementioned prevention strategies
- **Evaluation and Intervention:** Identify and address precipitating factors such as:
  - Pain
  - Hypoxia
  - Pneumonia
  - Infection
  - Electrolyte abnormalities
  - Hypoglycemia
  - Medication-related issues
- **Pharmacological Treatment:** Administer Haloperidol 0.5mg-1mg IV/IM when other measures have failed

## High-Risk Drugs in Delirium and Potential Substitutes

|**Drug**|**Mechanism of Adverse Effect**|**Substitutes or Alternative Strategies**|**Comments**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Benzodiazepines|CNS sedation and withdrawal|Nonpharmacologic sleep protocol|Associated with delirium in hospitalized patients; if patient is already taking, maintain or lower dose, but do not discontinue abruptly|
|Opioid analgesics (especially meperidine)|Anticholinergic toxicity, CNS sedation, and fecal impaction|Local and regional analgesic measures; non-psychoactive pain medications (e.g., acetaminophen and NSAIDs) around the clock; reserve opioids for breakthrough and severe pain|Consider risks versus benefits, since uncontrolled pain can also cause delirium; patients with renal insufficiency are at elevated risk for adverse effects; naloxone can be used for severe overdoses|
|Nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics (e.g., zolpidem)|CNS sedation and withdrawal|Nonpharmacologic sleep protocol|Like other sedatives, these agents can cause delirium|
|Antihistamines, especially first-generation sedating agents (e.g., doxylamine and diphenhydramine)|Anticholinergic toxicity|Nonpharmacologic sleep protocol, pseudoephedrine for upper respiratory congestion, and non-sedating antihistamines for allergies|Patients should be asked about the use of over-the-counter medications; many patients do not realize that drugs with names ending in “PM” contain diphenhydramine or other sedating antihistamines|
|Alcohol|CNS sedation and withdrawal|If patient has a history of heavy intake, monitor closely and use benzodiazepines for withdrawal symptoms|The history taking must include questions about alcohol intake|
|Anticholinergics (e.g., oxybutynin and benztropine)|Anticholinergic toxicity|Lower the dose or use behavioral approaches for urinary incontinence (e.g., scheduled toileting)|Delirium is unusual at low doses|
|Anticonvulsants (e.g., primidone, phenobarbital, and phenytoin)|CNS sedation|Use an alternative agent or consider stopping if patient is at low risk for seizures and has no recent history of them|Delirium can occur despite therapeutic drug concentrations|
|Tricyclic antidepressants, especially tertiary amines (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine, and doxepin)|Anticholinergic toxicity|Serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and secondary amine tricyclics (e.g., nortriptyline and desipramine)|Newer agents (e.g., duloxetine) are as effective as tertiary amines for adjuvant treatment of chronic pain|
|Histamine H2-receptor blockers|Anticholinergic toxicity|Lower the dose or substitute antacids or proton-pump inhibitors|Anticholinergic toxic effects occur primarily with high-dose intravenous infusions|
|Antiparkinsonian agents (e.g., levodopa and amantadine)|Dopaminergic toxicity|Lower the dose or adjust dosage schedule|Dopaminergic toxic effects occur primarily in advanced disease and at high doses|
|Antipsychotics, especially low-potency typical antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine and thioridazine)|Anticholinergic toxicity as well as CNS sedation|Discontinue entirely or, if necessary, use low doses of high-potency agents|Carefully consider risks vs. benefits of use in delirium|
|Barbiturates|CNS sedation and severe withdrawal syndrome|Gradual discontinuation or benzodiazepine substitution|In most cases, barbiturates should not be prescribed; avoid inadvertent or abrupt discontinuation|

## Pharmacologic Therapy of Agitated Delirium

|**Agent**|**Drug Class**|**Dosing**|**Routes**|**Degree of Sedation**|**Risk of EPS**|**Adverse Effects**|**Comments**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Haloperidol|Typical antipsychotic|Initial: 0.25–0.5 mg; Maximum: 3 mg|Oral, IM, or IV|Low|High|Risk of EPS increases if daily dose exceeds 3 mg|Longest track record in delirium; several large trials are ongoing|
|Risperidone|Atypical antipsychotic|Initial: 0.25–0.5 mg; Maximum: 3 mg|Oral|Low|High|Slightly less risk of EPS than with haloperidol at low doses|Small trials; considered to be very similar to haloperidol|
|Olanzapine|Atypical antipsychotic|Initial: 2.5–5 mg; Maximum: 20 mg|Oral, sublingual, or IM|Moderate|Moderate|More sedating than haloperidol|Small trials; oral route is less effective than other routes for management of acute symptoms|
|Quetiapine|Atypical antipsychotic|Initial: 12.5–25 mg; Maximum: 50 mg|Oral|High|Low|Much more sedating than haloperidol; risk of hypotension|Small trials; can be used, with caution, in patients who have parkinsonism|
|Ziprasidone|Atypical antipsychotic|Initial: 5–10 mg; Maximum: 40 mg|Oral or IM|Moderate|Moderate|More sedating than haloperidol; risk of cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure, and agranulocytosis|Owing to risks, used primarily in ICU; large trial is ongoing|
|Lorazepam|Benzodiazepine|Initial: 0.25–0.5 mg; Maximum: 2 mg|Oral, IM, or IV|Very high|None|More paradoxical excitation and respiratory depression than with haloperidol|Second-line agent; use in sedative and alcohol withdrawal or if patient has a history of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome|
