# Infection Control

## Decontamination

A process of removing pathogenic microorganisms from an object or surface so that it is no longer capable of transmitting infectious particles. 

It is a combination of the processes of cleaning, disinfection, and/or sterilisation.

## Cleaning

A process of removing organic and inorganic material from an object or surface with water and enzymatic products or detergent. It is the first step in all decontamination processes.

## Disinfection

A process that eliminates many or all pathogenic microorganisms, except bacterial spores, on objects or surfaces. There are three levels of disinfection based on the antimicrobial spectrum and rapidity of action:

### High-level Disinfection (HLD)
- Destroys all microorganisms (mycobacteria, vegetative bacteria, viruses and fungal spores), except large numbers of bacterial spores in a relatively short exposure time.
- Examples of disinfectants: Glutaraldehyde, orthophthalaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid.
- Used for semi-critical instrument decontamination.
### Intermediate-level Disinfection (ILD)
- Destroys mycobacteria, vegetative bacteria, most viruses, and most fungi, but does not kill bacterial spores.
- Examples of disinfectants: 70% isopropyl alcohol, iodophor and phenolic compounds, concentrated quaternary ammonium compounds, e.g. hospital cleaners and disinfectants with a tuberculocidal claim.
- Used for non-critical instruments and environmental surfaces when a tuberculocidal agent is necessary.
### Low-level Disinfection (LLD)
- Destroys lipid or medium-sized viruses, some fungal spores and vegetative bacteria.
- Examples of disinfectants: Diluted quaternary ammonium compounds, e.g. hospital cleaners and disinfectants without a tuberculocidal claim.
- Used for non-critical items and surfaces when a tuberculocidal agent is not needed.
### Sterilisation

A process whereby all types of microorganisms, e.g. mycobacteria, vegetative bacteria, viruses and fungal spores, including bacterial endospores, are eliminated.

Examples of methods include pressurised steam (autoclaves) or low-temperature sterilisation methods, e.g. ethylene oxide gas and hydrogen peroxide plasma, as well as hot air ovens. It is used for critical instrument decontamination.

## SASA Infection Control Guidelines

## Hand Hygiene Moments

### 1. Before Touching a Patient
- Ensure hands are clean before any direct contact with the patient to prevent the transmission of infectious agents.

### 2. Before Clean/Aseptic Procedure
- Perform hand hygiene before any procedure requiring aseptic techniques, such as catheter insertion, wound dressing, or IV administration.

### 3. After Body Fluid Exposure Risk
- Clean hands immediately after exposure to body fluids to protect yourself and the patient from potential infections.

### 4. After Touching a Patient
- Perform hand hygiene after any direct contact with a patient to prevent cross-contamination to other patients or environments.

### 5. After Touching Patient Surroundings
- Clean hands after touching any surfaces or objects in the patient's surroundings to maintain a clean and safe environment for all.
# General Infection Control for the Anaesthesiologist

## 1. General Principles
- Active infection control programmes should be operational in each theatre complex.
- Single-use devices should be utilized only once.

## 2. Safe Injection Practices and Preventing Contamination of Medication and Fluids
- Syringes must not be reused or reinserted into a medication vial or solution bag, even for the same patient.
- Needles should not be reinserted into a multi-dose vial or solution bag, even for the same patient.
- Drug vials should not be shared between patients.
- Multi-dose vials should only be used to administer multiple doses to the same patient.
- Injection ports must be cleaned with alcohol before each injection.

## 3. Hand Hygiene Guidelines
- Adhere to the WHO five moments of hand hygiene:
  1. Before patient contact
  2. After patient contact
  3. Before performing any procedure
  4. After potential contact with body fluids
  5. After contact with the patient environment
- Use sufficient alcohol-based hand rub for adequate decontamination.
- Gloves should be worn when contact with body fluids or mucous membranes is anticipated.
- Gloves should be removed before touching clinical notes, pens, telephones, and other equipment.

## 4. Anaesthetic Equipment Decontamination
- **Laryngoscope Blades**: Should undergo high-level disinfection at a minimum, with sterilization being the advocated method.
- **Magill Forceps**: Should be sterilized after each use.
- **Other Equipment**:
  - Temperature probes
  - Suction tubing and bowl
  - Oropharyngeal/Nasopharyngeal airways (OPA/NPA)
  - Bougies/introducers
  - Bag-valve masks (BVM)

## 5. Prevention of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infection
- **Placement of CVP**: Use sterile technique.
- **Catheter Dressing and Site Management**: Including antimicrobial dressings where appropriate.
- **Removal of Lines**: If sterile technique is compromised, lines should be removed as soon as possible and within 48 hours.
- **Central Line Insertion**: Should be a sterile procedure.
- **Cleaning of Connectors and Access Ports**: Proper cleaning before connection or injection.

## 6. Infection Control Recommendations for Regional Anaesthesia
- Wear caps, masks, sterile gowns, and gloves for central neuraxial anaesthetic techniques.
- Use a sterile sheath when employing ultrasound.

## 7. Prevention of Surgical Site Infections (SSI) for the Anaesthetist
- Do not give antibiotic prophylaxis for clean, non-prosthetic uncomplicated surgery.
- Maintain optimal tissue perfusion and oxygenation.
- Consider using leucocyte-depleted blood in high-risk patients.

### Additional Principles to Support Immunity
#### Maintenance of Body Temperature
- Ensure normothermia for all patients undergoing anaesthesia.
- Hypothermia reduces tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery, impairs neutrophil function.

#### Perioperative Glucose Control
- Maintain blood glucose levels below 10 mmol/L.
- Hyperglycaemia impairs neutrophil function and increases the risk of wound sepsis and impaired wound healing.
- Avoid hypoglycaemia.

#### Antibiotic Prophylaxis
- Administer antibiotics approximately 30 minutes prior to skin incision.
- It is accepted practice for the anaesthetist to administer antibiotics in the theatre suite before skin incision, as part of the WHO surgical safety checklist.

## Controversies and Unsupported Practices
### Universal or Standard Precautions
- Standard precautions, as defined by the CDC, should be adopted for all patient contact. This includes:
  1. Hand hygiene
  2. Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, goggles, gowns
  3. Proper disposal of sharp objects
  4. Appropriate cleaning of patient care equipment

### Patient Preparation for Theatre
- No infection control risk exists from patients wearing their own clothing in the theatre.
- Patients removing their underwear is unnecessary and embarrassing.
- Patients do not need to cover their hair in the operating theatre.
- Bathing with chlorhexidine soap prior to major surgery may reduce gram-positive wound sepsis.
- Shaving of the surgical site should be discouraged; clipping hair immediately preoperatively if necessary.

### Surgical Facemasks
- Those within 1 meter of the surgical field should wear facemasks, especially if speaking over the field.
- Facemasks should be worn during all sterile procedures and must cover both nose and mouth.
- Always wear facemasks for personal protection during intubation.

### Theatre Attire
- Routine use of theatre caps for non-scrubbed staff is not supported by evidence.
  - Caps should be worn by all staff in laminar flow theatres.
- Theatre clothing should be socially clean.
- Wedding bands do not need to be removed but may increase glove perforation.
- False fingernails should not be permitted due to pathogen harboring.
- No evidence supports an increased infection risk from wearing theatre attire outside the theatre.
- Disposable overshoes should be outlawed due to increased hand contamination.
- Visitors should not be required to dress in theatre garb or wear overshoes.
- Caution should be exercised for those taking theatre attire home for cleaning.
