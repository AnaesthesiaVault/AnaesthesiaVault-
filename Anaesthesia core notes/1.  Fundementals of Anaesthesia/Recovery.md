# General Principles

- **Anaesthesiologist Availability**: The anaesthesiologist should be readily available during the recovery period until the patient is deemed fit for transfer.

1. **Supervision and Location**: Recovery from anaesthesia must occur under appropriate supervision in a designated area, either in the theatre itself or nearby.
2. **Trained Staff**: Staff in the recovery area must be appropriately trained and able to promptly contact the anaesthesiologist or their designate.
3. **Patient Stability**: Patients should regain consciousness and stabilize before transport.
4. **Transport Requirements**: If transport is necessary while the patient is not fully recovered, they must be on a suitable trolley/bed with head-down tilt capability, oxygen, lung inflation equipment, suction equipment, and appropriate monitoring. Accompanying staff must be able to manage potential issues during transport.
5. **SASA Guidelines**: The SASA Guidelines describe the physical space, equipment, and drugs in detail.

# Requirements of Recovery Room

1. **Staff and Equipment**: Appropriately trained staff and necessary equipment in a designated area near the theatre.
2. **Safe Transfer**: Preferably transfer patients once awake or under supervision if not.
3. **Protocols**: Written protocols for safe management.
4. **Routine Checks**: Daily routine of checking drugs and equipment.
5. **Observation Recording**: Recording observations at appropriate intervals.
6. **Anaesthetist Supervision**: Anaesthetist responsible for supervising recovery period and discharge.

## Staff

- **Institutional Responsibility**: Ensure staff are trained and competent.
- **Availability**: Recovery staff must be available at all times.
- **Nurse Requirements**:
  - A registered or enrolled nurse trained and competent in recovery room care must be present at all times.
  - An appropriately trained registered nurse experienced and competent in recovery room work should be in charge.
  - Staffing ratios should be flexible, providing no less than 1:2 nurse/patient ratio, and one nurse for each patient who has not recovered protective reflexes.
  - Ideally, a 2:1 nurse/patient ratio for compromised or critically ill patients, with one nurse for care and the other for documentation and monitoring.
  - Special adjustments for paediatric and geriatric patients, with two nurses per patient until full return of protective reflexes.
  - All inexperienced staff should work under direct supervision of qualified staff.

## Management and Supervision

- **Written Protocols**: Establish protocols for safe management.
- **Routine Checks**: Establish a written routine for checking equipment and drugs.
- **Observation Recording**: Record observations at appropriate intervals, including consciousness, colour, respiration, oxygen saturation, pulse, blood pressure, and pain level. This record should be part of the patient’s clinical notes.
- **Anaesthesiologist Responsibilities**:
  - Supervising the recovery period and authorizing patient discharge.
  - Accompanying the patient to the recovery room and handing over to nursing staff.
  - Providing written and verbal instructions to recovery room staff.
  - Specifying apparatus and flow rate for oxygen therapy.
  - Remaining in the facility until patient meets discharge criteria or delegating this responsibility to another anaesthesiologist or intensivist.

## Patient Safety Issues

- **Equipment and Staffing**: Ensure adequate equipment and trained staff as per SASA guidelines.
- **Observation Recording**: Observations should include activity, respiration, circulation, consciousness, and oxygen saturation.
- **Complications**: Incidence of complications > 20%, with major issues including nausea and vomiting (10%), respiratory support needs, and circulatory issues.
  - Elderly patients: longer surgery, shorter recovery, higher intra-operative cardiovascular events.
  - Younger patients: higher adverse events in recovery, mainly pain, and nausea/vomiting.

### Ensuring Safe Recovery

1. **Proper Equipment**: Equip recovery rooms as per SASA guidelines.
2. **Staffing Requirements**: Ensure staffing in accordance with SASA, with dedicated staff for the recovery room.
3. **Protocols and Observations**: Implement protocols and record observations.
4. **Anaesthesiologist Discharge**: Anaesthesiologist must discharge patients from the recovery room using the Modified Aldrete Scoring system.
  - A score of ≥ 9 is required for discharge.
  - Oxygen saturation is a crucial parameter for discharge, indicating adequate cardiorespiratory function and absence of shivering and pain.
5. **Pain-Free**: Ensure the patient is pain-free.
6. **No Nausea and Vomiting**: Ensure the patient is free from nausea and vomiting.

# 5 Points Anaesthetists Must Check Before a Patient Can Be Handed Over to the Recovery Room Staff (STAMPED)

1. **Stable**: Ensure patients are stable in all respects.
2. **Tell**: Inform the recovery staff about the patient's preoperative and intraoperative conditions/problems.
3. **Airway**: Confirm that the airway is secured.
4. **Muscle**: Ensure muscle relaxants are adequately reversed.
5. **Pain**: Manage pain and nausea effectively.
6. **Ensure**: Verify that fluids and haemoglobin are adequately replaced.
7. **Discharge**: Prepare the patient for discharge from the recovery room.

# Responsibilities and Guidelines for Anaesthetists and Recovery Room (RR) Nurses

## Anaesthetist Responsibilities

- Remain available in the theatre complex until it is safe to assume anaesthesia effects have worn off.
- Formally hand over care to a recovery room nurse or trained staff member.
- Ensure spontaneous breathing and appropriate oxygen saturation.
- Confirm recovery from neuromuscular blockers.
- Ensure haemodynamic stability and adequate control of pain and nausea.
- Remain with the patient if significant blood loss occurred until volume resuscitation is adequate and haemoglobin levels are tested.
- Assist in handover along with anaesthetic nurse and scrub sister.
- Ensure patient identification during handover.

## RR Nurse Responsibilities

- Document details of the procedure, patient condition, anaesthetic given, pain control needs, and specific orders.
- Verify the patient's condition before assuming full responsibility, especially before extubation unless otherwise agreed.
- Monitor and document vital signs (e.g., SaO₂, BP, pulse) and any significant physical changes.
- Recognize and report life-threatening situations and anaesthetic-related problems to the anaesthetist.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and administer prescribed pain control.
- Ensure continuous monitoring and professional handover until recovery discharge.
## Three Stages of Recovery from Anaesthesia

### First Stage
- **Duration**: Until the patient is awake, protective airway reflexes have returned, and pain is controlled.
- **Location**: Recovery area.
- **Assessment Tool**: Modified Aldrete Score to assess readiness.
- **Note**: This stage may be bypassed for loco-regional cases.

### Second Stage
- **Duration**: From when the patient can self-mobilize until discharge from the hospital.
- **Location**: Ward or short stay room.
- **Surveillance**: Monitor for postoperative problems and emergencies.
- **Assessment Tool**: MPADSS (Modified Post Anaesthesia Discharge Scoring System) to assess readiness.
- **Discharge**: Provide written information upon discharge.

### Late Recovery
- **Duration**: Ends when the patient has made a full physiological and psychological recovery from surgery.
- **Timeline**: This may take weeks to months.

## Considerations When Discharging a Patient from Recovery

- **Airway**: Ensure protective airway reflexes have returned and the airway is maintained.
- **Breathing**: Confirm respiratory rate is between 10-20, with a regular respiratory pattern. SpO₂ should be ≥ 96% or equal to pre-operative level. Oxygen should be prescribed where indicated.
- **Circulation**: Verify blood pressure and heart rate are stable, with specific values dependent on pre-operative measurements. Ensure there are no unexplained or unmanaged arrhythmias.
- **Conscious Level**: The patient should have preoperative orientation or further assessment carried out.
- **Pain**: Pain should be controlled, and postoperative analgesia prescribed.
- **PONV (Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting)**: Ensure PONV is controlled and treatment is prescribed where indicated.
- **Temperature**: Defer ward discharge until core temperature is ≥ 36°C.
- **Wound/Drains/Dressing**: Dressings should be intact with no evidence of excessive blood loss from wound sites or drains.
- **Neuraxial Block**: Spinal sensory level should be < T6 or epidural sensory level at or below the level specified by the anaesthetist.
- **IV Access**: Cannula should be flushed of residual drugs and patent.
- **Drugs/IV Fluids**: Infusions should be prescribed, checked, and appropriately labelled.

## Discharge Criteria

- **Stable Vital Signs**: for at least one hour.
- **Alertness**: Patient oriented to time, place, and person.
- **Pain Control**: No excessive pain, bleeding, or nausea.
- **Assistance**: Ability to dress and walk with assistance.
- **Supervised Discharge**: Ensure a responsible adult is available for home care.
- **Instructions**: Written and verbal instructions provided for diet, activity, medications, and follow-up.
- **Professional Consultation**: Available for any new concerns.
- **Specific Medical Clearance**: Necessary for certain conditions or patient demographics.

## Modified Aldrete Score

### Observations
- Record at appropriate intervals, including:
  - State of consciousness
  - Colour
  - Respiration
  - Oxygen saturation
  - Pulse
  - Blood pressure
  - Level of pain
- These records should be part of the patient’s clinical notes.

### Criteria for Discharge
- Patients should score 2/2 for each of the five categories, unless there is a justified reason for not meeting these criteria.
- **Discharge Readiness**: A score of 9 or more out of 10 is required for discharge.
- **Key Parameter**: Oxygen saturation, as it reflects an adequate cardiorespiratory system and indicates the absence of undesirable effects such as shivering and pain.
- Patients should remain in the recovery room until the anaesthesiologist considers it safe to discharge them based on validated criteria, including:
  - Return of protective airway reflexes
  - Stable cardiovascular and respiratory function
  - Full reversal of neuromuscular blockade
  - Absence of nausea and vomiting
  - Absence of pain
### Aldrete Score

|Parameter|Description|Score|
|---|---|---|
|**Activity**|Able to move 4 extremities voluntarily or on command|2|
||Able to move 2 extremities voluntarily or on command|1|
||Able to move 0 extremities voluntarily or on command|0|
|**Respiration**|Able to deep breathe and cough freely|2|
||Dyspnoea or limited breathing|1|
||Apnoeic|0|
|**Circulation**|BP ± 20% of preanaesthetic level|2|
||BP ± 20-50% of preanaesthetic level|1|
||BP ± 50% of preanaesthetic level|0|
|**Consciousness**|Fully awake|2|
||Arousable on calling|1|
||Not responding|0|
|**Colour**|Pink (SaO₂ ≥ 92% on room air)|2|
||Pale, dusky blotchy, (O₂ required for SaO₂ > 90%)|1|
||Cyanotic (SaO₂ < 90% despite supplementary oxygen)|0|

## Causes of Arterial Hypoxemia in the PACU

### Hypoventilation

- Residual narcotics
- Residual benzodiazepines
- Residual inhaled anaesthetics
- Residual muscle relaxants
- Pain, splinting
- Restrictive conditions (e.g., abdominal wall binding)
- Airway obstruction
- Bronchospasm

### V/Q Mismatch and Shunt

- Atelectasis
- Inhibition of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
- Pulmonary edema
- Aspiration, pneumonitis
- Increased venous admixture
# Paediatric Recovery

## General Considerations

- **Requirements**: Caring for paediatric patients after anaesthesia has similar requirements to adults with the following additions:
	- **Experienced Staff**: Recovery staff experienced in paediatric care.
	- **Emergency Equipment**: An emergency equipment cart with paediatric-specific equipment, including intraosseous lines.
	- **Drug Chart**: A drug chart with paediatric dosages.

## Parental Presence

- **Controversy**: The issue of parental presence in the recovery room is controversial.
- **Guidelines**:
	- In mixed areas with both paediatric and adult patients, it is not advisable to allow parental presence.
	- If a child is inconsolable after emergence and all physiological parameters are stable, parents may be allowed into the recovery room at the discretion of the nursing staff.

## Outpatient Surgery / Day Case Discharge
### Postanaesthesia Discharge Scoring System (PADS) for Determining Home-Readiness

- **Usage**: The PADS system can be used for both children and adults.
- **Scoring**: Patients achieving a score of 9 or more may be discharged into the care of a responsible adult.
