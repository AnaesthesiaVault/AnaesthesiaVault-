# Aspiration
### Aspiration Pneumonia: Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

**Predisposing Factors:**

- **Intractable vomiting**
- **Tube feeding**
- **Poor oral health**
- **Alcohol and substance overdose**
- **Medications (e.g., opioids)**
- **Neurologic diseases (e.g., stroke)**
- **Esophageal and gastric disorders**
- **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder**

**Pathogenesis:**

1. **Aspiration of Oropharyngeal and Gastric Contents:**
	
	- Bacteria adhere to epithelial surfaces and risk of airway and lung bacterial colonization.
	- Altered level of consciousness and impaired cough/clearance.
	- Macroporation during eating and drinking.
	- Impaired swallowing.
2. **Aspiration Pneumonitis:**
	
	- If the acidic gastric contents are aspirated, they cause direct injury without infection.
3. **Progression to Aspiration Pneumonia:**
	
	- Aspiration of acidic fluid and pneumonia-causing bacteria lead to inflammation.
	- Bacteria and fluid fill bronchial and alveolar spaces.
	- Bacteria and fluid infiltrate into lung parenchyma and alveolar space.
	- Macroporation results in large volume aspirations.
	- Elimination and clearance of foreign bacteria from airway and lung.
	- Inflammation due to bacteria and gastric contents in lung tissue.

**Clinical Findings:**

- **Early Signs:**
	
	- Inflammatory response: alveolar macrophages recruit neutrophils.
	- Hypoxemia.
	- Consolidation in lower lobes (particularly posterior segments of upper lobes).
	- Crackles and lung auscultation.
	- Productive cough.
	- Dyspnea.
- **Complications:**
	
	- Proliferation of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to further tissue damage and necrosis.
	- Hypothalamic production of cytokines causing fever.
	- If untreated, abscess formation may occur.
- The prevention of aspiration remains a cornerstone of anaesthetic practice
- 50% of airway-related deaths in anaesthesia were as a consequence of aspiration, outweighing the (CICV) scenario
- **Definition**
	- The inhalation of oro-pharyngeal or gastric contents into the larynx and the respiratory tract
	- Aspiration of solid matter can cause hypoxia by physical obstruction, whereas aspiration of acidic gastric fluid can cause a pneumonitis with the syndrome of progressive dyspnoea, hypoxia bronchial wheeze and patchy collapse, consolidation on chest X-ray or all.
	- The risk of mortality and serious morbidity increases with bronchial exposure to greater volumes and acidity of aspirated material
- The incidence of aspiration under anaesthesia remains significantly greater with higher ASA status and emergency surgery
- In the setting of aspiration, regurgitation occurs three times more commonly than active vomiting
- 20% of aspiration occurs after extubation
## Physiology
- **Gastro-oesophageal junction
	- The acute angle formed anatomically between the distal oesophagus and stomach at the gastrooesophageal junction assists the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS), formed from a section of the distal oesophagus, in protecting the oesophagus from gastric acid reflux. Reinforced by the crura of the diaphragm, LOS resting pressure exceeds gastric pressure creating a physiological barrier to gastrooesophageal reflux, known as barrier pressure
	- Reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus occurs in both healthy individuals and those with pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (Gourd) when the LOS transiently relaxes in the absence of swallowing
	- there is no significant difference in the frequency of transient LOS relaxation between healthy people and those with pathological Gourd, transient LOS relaxation is more likely to be associated with acid reflux in patients with Gourd
	- During anaesthesia reflux may occur because barrier pressure is reduced by pharmacodynamic relaxation of the LOS caused by anticholinergics, thiopental, opioids, and inhalation anaesthetic agents
- **Upper oesophageal sphincter**
	- Cricopharyngeus, the inferior constrictor muscle of the pharynx, acts in combination with thyrophayngeus and the cervical oesophagus to form the functional upper oesophageal sphincter (UOS)
		- ricopharyngeus originates from the cricoid cartilage, to loop around the pharynx before inserting into the contralateral side of the cricoid cartilage
	- The UOS acts to prevent the reflux of oesophageal contents into the pharynx in conscious individuals
	- UOS tone is reduced in patients with reduced consciousness and attenuated by most drugs used for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with the notable exception of ketamine.
- **Protective airway reflexes
	- Coughing, expiration and laryngospasm
	- Variably affected by reduced levels of consciousness and may be reduced at any stage of the perioperative period, including after emergence. Elderly patients are particularly prone to higher risks of aspiration under anaesthesia because they, in general, have less active airway reflexes
## Risk Factors
### Patient
**(a) Full stomach**
- Emergency surgery
- Inadequate fasting time
- Gastrointestinal obstruction
**(b) Delayed gastric emptying**
- Systemic diseases, including diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease
- Recent trauma
- Opioids
- Raised intra-cranial pressure
- Previous gastrointestinal surgery.
- Pregnancy (including active labour)
**(c) Incompetent lower oesophageal sphincter**.
- Hiatus hernia.
- Recurrent regurgitation
- Dyspepsia
- Previous upper gastrointestinal surgery
- Pregnancy
**(d) Oesophageal diseases**
- Previous gastrointestinal surgery
- Morbid obesity
### Surgical Factors
- Upper gastrointestinal surgery
- Lithotomy or head down position
- Laparoscopy
- Choleocystectomy
### Anaesthetic Factors
- Light anaesthesia
- Supra-glottic airways
- Positive pressure ventilation
- Length of surgery >2h
- Difficult airway
- Device factorsFirst-generation supra-glottic airway devices

In pregnancy, the gravid uterus displaces the stomach, so altering the angle formed between the oesophagus and stomach. This effect is exacerbated by maternal obesity, multiple pregnancy, and polyhydramnious. Higher concentrations of progesterone reduce barrier pressure further by relaxing the LOS, whilst decreased concentrations of the peptide hormone motilin delays gastric emptying

## Risk Reduction
### Strategies
- **Reducing gastric volume**
	- Preoperative fasting
	- Nasogastric aspiration
	- Prokinetic premedication
- **Avoidance of general anaesthetic**
	- Regional anaesthesia
- **Reducing pH of gastric contents**
	- Antacids H2 histamine antagonists
	- Proton pump inhibitors
- **Airway protection**
	- Tracheal intubation
	- Second-generation supra-glottic airway devices
	- Cricoid pressure
	- Rapid sequence induction
- **Extubation**
	- Awake after return of airway reflexes
	- Position (lateral, head down or upright)
### Guidelines
1. Experienced anaesthesia assistance available to all times
2. Intubate all emergency cases
3. Apply appropriate cricoid pressure with all inductions using neuromuscular blocking agents
4. Intubate/seriously consider intubation in the following: Delayed gastric emptying (pregnancy, opioids, diabetes mellitus, renal failure) Increased intra-abdominal pressure (obesity, ascites, masses)
5. Extubate high-risk cases awake and on their side. Extubate all others on their side
## Summary
1. All patients must be assessed for aspiration risk before surgery, especially urgent and emergency cases. In cases of doubt, the higher risk should be assumed.
2. Airway management strategies should be consistent with identified risk.
3. The equipment and skills to detect and manage regurgitation and aspiration should be available at all times.
4. Rapid sequence induction remains the standard technique for airway protection.
5. Those applying cricoid pressure should be trained in its application and practice applying cricoid pressure regularly.
6. In cases where tracheal intubation is not indicated, but when a small increase in aspiration exists, Second generation supraglottic airways should be considered.
7. Strategies should be used to reduce aspiration at emergence if the patient is at risk of aspiration.
8. Anaesthetists should be aware of the prevention, detection and management of blood clot aspiration.
9. Active measure should be taken when a flat capnography trace occurs when blood has been near the airway.
## Management
**Initial management**
- _Breathing, conscious:_ Suction and recovery position
- _Breathing, unconscious:_ Head down, left lateral, CP if not actively vomiting
- _Not breathing:_ Intubate. Suction down prior to ventilation if possible
- Most patients are extubatable unless hypoxic
- Consider deferring the surgery
**Further management (watching)**
### Suggested Algorithm for the Management of Pulmonary Aspiration

**Assessment (up to 2 hours for new signs):**

- **Signs to Monitor:**
	- Cough or wheeze.
	- Decreased oxygen saturation on room air.
	- Alveolar-arterial O2 gradient >300 mmHg.
	- New infiltrations on CXR.

**Management Based on Findings:**

- **If one or more new signs within 2 hours:**
	- Admit to higher level of care (High Dependency Unit or Intensive Care Unit).
- **If no new infiltrates or signs:**
	- Discharge to ward as planned.
Head down & left lateral position
Suction:
If able to get an ETT in position don't ventilate until a suction catheter has been passed down the ETT. A flexible bronchscope can also be used.
Signs of aspiration include:
visualisation of gastric content in the trachea, persistent hypoxia, high airway pressures, bronchospasm, and abnormal breath sounds following intubation.
In life threatening aspiration ECMO can be considered.
**ICU**
- Lung protective ventilation (6-8 mL/kg, 10 cmH₂O PEEP)
- Brochodilators
- Fibreoptic bronchoscopy if particulate plugging is suspected
- No role for prophylactic ABx or steroids

# Rapid Sequence Induction
## RSI Checklist

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314170638.png)

## Clinical Approach

**Classical RSII:**

- **Cricoid Pressure:**
	- 10 lbs posteriorly.
	- Esophagus at the level of cricoid obstructed.
	- Reduced gastric regurgitation.
- **Medication Administration:**
	- Succinylcholine (2 mg/kg): Depolarizes and relaxes skeletal muscle.
	- Preoxygenation with 100% O2, 8 vital capacity breaths (2.0 L/S): Extends time to desaturation.
	- Induction Agent (e.g., Ketamine or Propofol 2 mg/kg): Induces anesthesia.
	- Oxygenation continued.
- **Paralysis:**
	- Rapid skeletal muscle paralysis (30-60 seconds) with short duration (<10 minutes).

**Modified RSII:**

- **Medication Adjustments:**
	- High dose Rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg): Non-competitive with acetylcholine, longer duration (>45 minutes).
	- Preoxygenation similar to classical RSII.
	- Induction agent as above.
	- Decreased acetylcholine release from the central nervous system.
- **Paralysis:**
	- Rapid skeletal muscle paralysis (50-90 seconds) with longer duration (>45 minutes).

### Risks Vs Benefits of Inhalational Vs RSI

**RSI:**

- **Benefits:**
	- Faster induction.
	- Protection against aspiration.
	- Avoiding MH risk (if suxamethonium not used).
- **Risks:**
	- Requires IV access.
	- Pain on injection.
	- Bradycardia and hypotension on induction.
	- Apnea - dangerous with difficult airway.
	- Raised intra-ocular pressure.

**Inhalational Induction:**

- **Benefits:**
	- Painless.
	- Titrable.
	- Rapidly reversible.
	- Spontaneous breathing for difficult airway.
	- Parental presence possible.
- **Risks:**
	- Anxiety with mask phobia.
	- Pungent smell.
	- Longer induction time.
	- Emergence agitation with sevoflurane.
	- Risk of aspiration.

**Risk Factors for Aspiration in Pediatric Population:**

1. Anxiety, inadequate/light anesthesia.
2. Gastric distension from bag valve mask ventilation.
3. Increased intra-abdominal pressure.
4. Difficult airway, GI pathology, obesity.
5. GOR, esophageal disease.
6. Sepsis, renal failure, opioids before operation.
- Aspiration sequalae are less severe in kidsUK study. If deteriorations occurs it occurs within 2 hrs.
- No mortality reported in above study
- **Pros and cons of cricoid**
- Disadvantages
	- Children may not have alignment between the cricoid cartilage (CC) and oesophagus
	- CC is harder to identify
	- Application of CP decreases LOS tone, predisposing to aspiration  
	- Forces of ± 30N are applied to adults, whereas just 7.7N may compress a child's airway, obscuring or worsening the view  
- Advantages
	- Effectively applied cricoid pressure may prevent gastric insufflation up to a maximal pressure of 40 cmH2O in children between 2 weeks and 8 yr old.

## RSI in Adults

### Classical RSI
1. **Preoxygenation**
2. **Cricoid Pressure**
3. **Induction:**
   - Predetermined dose of thiopental and succinylcholine
4. **Avoidance of Positive Pressure Ventilation**
5. **Rapid Tracheal Intubation:**
   - Use of cuffed tube before removal of cricoid pressure

#### Preoxygenation
- **Function:**
  - Increases the reserves of oxygen within the lungs by denitrogenation of the functional residual capacity (FRC).
  - Prolongs the apnoeic period before hypoxaemia ensues.
  - Efficacy measured by the end-tidal oxygenation fraction, approximating the alveolar oxygen fraction.
  - Full denitrogenation achieved with end-tidal oxygenation fraction >0.9.

#### Apnoeic Oxygenation and Bulk Flow
- **Apnoeic-Oxygenation:**
  - Maintenance of a patent airway during apnoea allows oxygen to reach the alveoli by bulk flow.
  - Result of differences in oxygen consumption and CO2 production rates.
  - During apnoea, CO2 enters the alveoli at 0.12–0.25 ml/kg/min, while O2 is removed at 2–3 ml/kg/min (adults), 4–8 ml/kg/min (paediatrics).
  - Net gas volume removal reduces barometric pressure, facilitating bulk flow of oxygen.
  - Use of nasal prongs and facemask prolongs desaturation time.
  - Importance of continuous positive airway pressure to reduce atelectasis, especially in children.

#### Induction
- **Drugs:**
  - **Propofol:** Suppresses laryngeal reflexes.
  - **Succinylcholine (2 mg/kg):** Recovery time to spontaneous ventilation is 4.7 minutes.
  - **Rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg):** Reversed with 16 mg/kg of sugammadex.
  - **Atropine (Premedication):** Not recommended; did not prevent bradycardia in all children.

### Factors Making Emergency Intubation Difficult
1. Dynamically deteriorating clinical situation
2. Non-cooperative patient
3. Respiratory and ventilatory compromise
4. Impaired oxygenation
5. Full stomach (increased risk of regurgitation, vomiting, aspiration)
6. Extremely short safe apnoea times
7. Secretions, blood, vomitus, and distorted anatomy

### Process of RSI
**9 Ps:**
1. Plan
2. Preparation (drugs, equipment, people, place)
3. Protect the cervical spine
4. Positioning (some do this after paralysis and induction)
5. Preoxygenation
6. Pretreatment (optional; e.g., atropine, fentanyl, lignocaine)
7. Paralysis and Induction
8. Placement with proof
9. Postintubation management

### Preparation for RSI
- Control over:
  - **Self**
  - **Patient**
  - **Others**
  - **Environment**
- **SOAPME:**
  - **Suction:** At least one working suction, place between mattress and bed.
  - **Oxygen:** NRBM and BVM attached to 15 LPM of O2, with nasal prongs for apnoeic oxygenation.
  - **Airways:**
	- 7.5 ET tube with stylet for most adults, 7.0 for smaller females, 8.0 for larger males.
	- Test balloon with 10 cc of air.
	- **Stylet:** Inside ET tube for rigidity, bend 30 degrees at the proximal end of the cuff.
	- **Blade:** Mac 3 or 4 (curved) or Miller 3 or 4 (straight) for adults.
	- **Handle:** Ensure light source works.
	- **Backups:** Surgical cric kit, video laryngoscope, LMA, and bougie at bedside.
  - **Pre-oxygenate:** 15 LPM NRBM.
  - **Monitoring Equipment/Medications:** Cardiac monitor, pulse oximetry, BP cuff opposite arm with IV. Medications ready.
  - **End Tidal CO2.**

### Cricoid Pressure
- **Indications:**
  - Prevent passive regurgitation during RSI.
  - Recommended for high-risk cases (e.g., upper GI surgery, obstetric anaesthesia, bowel obstruction).
- **Contraindications:**
  - Suspected cricotracheal injury.
  - Active vomiting.
  - Unstable cervical spine injuries.
  - Inadequate view of the cords on laryngoscopy.
  - Need for BVM ventilations.
  - Decision to use LMA instead of intubation.
  - Lack of belief in its utility.
- **Method:**
  - Applied by a trained assistant.
  - Identify cricoid cartilage (C6 level).
  - Place index finger over cartilage, thumb and middle finger on either side.
  - Apply 10N force while patient is awake, increase to 30N when patient loses consciousness.
  - Maintain pressure until tracheal intubation, cuff inflation, and ventilation of both lungs.
- **Rationale:**
  - Achieve oesophageal compression against vertebrae to prevent regurgitation.
  - Limits gastric insufflation during BVM ventilation.
  - No aspiration-related deaths in UK obstetric anaesthesia since 1960s introduction.
  - No increase in failed intubation rates in elective surgeries.
- **Problems:**
  - Ineffectiveness: No reduction in aspiration risk.
  - Poor performance and assistant fatigue.
  - Incorrect force application.
  - Esophagus lateral to cricoid cartilage 90% of the time.
  - Obscures laryngoscopic view, potentially making intubation difficult.
  - If patient vomits, risk of oesophageal rupture.
  - Difficulties in BVM and LMA ventilation.
  - Decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone.
  - Aspiration despite cricoid pressure documented.
  - Uncomfortable for awake patients, may trigger coughing or vomiting.
  - Adds complexity and cognitive load.
  - Requires additional assistant and commands.
