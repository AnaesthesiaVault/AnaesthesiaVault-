# Premedication

## Introduction
- Premedication refers to any drug or therapy administered before surgery.
- The classification of modern premedication is based on the action of the drugs used and is broadly divided into five categories:
  1. Continuation of current medications
  2. Analgesia
  3. Prokinetic/antacid/antiemetic
  4. Anxiolytic
  5. Other

## Continuation of Current Medications
- **General Rule**: Most preoperative medications are continued except for:
  - **Antiplatelet Medications**: Typically discontinued 10 days before surgery.
  - **Warfarin and Other Anticoagulants**: Usually stopped, replaced with low molecular weight heparin, or reduced to achieve a target INR specific to the surgical procedure.
- **Cardiac Medications**: Should be universally continued.
  - **Beta-Blockers**: Preexisting beta-blockers reduce peri-operative mortality.
  - **ACE Inhibitors**: Though they may cause intraoperative hypotension, they do not lead to postoperative sequelae and are generally continued.
  - **Diuretics**:
	- Thiazides: Have little diuretic effect, mainly vasodilatory.
	- Loop Diuretics: May increase fasting-induced hypovolemia and the need for a urinary catheter.
- **Bronchodilators**: Should be continued.

## Analgesic Premedication
- **Pre-emptive Analgesia**: Depriving nociceptive receptors of input during surgery to reduce postoperative pain has been debated, but preoperative oral analgesia is generally accepted to ensure balanced multimodal analgesic regimens.
  - Advantages: Simplicity, cost savings, avoidance of parenteral drug errors, and reduced anaphylaxis risk.

### Paracetamol
- **Uses**:
  - Minor postoperative pain.
  - Reduces postoperative opiate requirements.
  - Addresses postoperative headache, particularly after sevoflurane anesthesia.
  - Antipyretic effect beneficial for some patients.
  
#### Preoperative Medication Dosing
**Adults**
- **Weight > 70 kg**: 2 g orally at least 30 minutes before planned surgery.
- **Weight < 70 kg**: 1 g orally.

**Children**
- 20 mg/kg orally.
- Alternatively, 40 mg/kg rectally.

### Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
- **Uses**: Address moderate postoperative pain and reduce opiate requirements.
- **Effective Doses**:
  - Diclofenac 50-100 mg.
  - Ibuprofen 400 mg (5-10 mg/kg in children).
  - Naproxen 500 mg.
- **Considerations**:
  - **Bleeding Risk**: Use cautiously in neurosurgery, head and neck surgery, cardiac surgery, or where major blood loss is anticipated.
  - **Renal Function**: Withhold in patients with eGFR < 20 ml/min.
  - **Bone Healing**: Concerns about COX-1 drugs affecting bone healing in orthopedic surgeries are not supported by human trials.

### Gabapentin
- **Uses**: Chronic pain management and as a useful adjunct in certain situations.
- **Side Effects**: Postoperative drowsiness is acceptable where pre-existing pain makes postoperative pain control challenging.
- **Dosage**: Single dose of 300 mg; higher doses may slow recovery in naive patients.

### Clonidine
- **Uses**: Analgesic and anxiolytic agent in children.
- **Dosage**: 2-4 µg/kg.

### Local Anesthetics
- **Uses**:
  - EMLA or Ametop creams reduce pain from cannulation in children and anxious adults, graft donor sites, and grommets.
  - Benzocaine lozenges prepare patients for awake fiberoptic intubation.
  - Co-phenylcaine nasal spray useful before transphenoidal pituitary surgery and nasal/sinus surgery.

## Prokinetic, Antacid, and Antiemetic Drugs
### Metoclopramide
- **Adult Dose**: 10 mg orally to reduce gastric volume and increase lower esophageal sphincter tone.
- **Combination**: With sodium citrate (15 ml orally), ranitidine (150 mg orally), or omeprazole (20 mg orally) to reduce gastric volume and acidity, minimizing regurgitation/aspiration risk.

### Hyoscine
- **Uses**: Previously an antisialagogue, now used as a patch (one per 72 hours) near the mastoid process for patients at high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting, particularly in labyrinthine or posterior fossa surgery.

## Anxiolytics
- **Effectiveness**: Studies show information and preoperative discussions with an anesthetist are as effective as drug administration.
- **Common Drugs**:
  - **Adults**: Temazepam (10-20 mg) or lorazepam (2 mg) for a more profound effect.
  - **Children**: Midazolam syrup (0.5 mg/kg orally or 0.2 mg/kg intranasally).

## Other
- **Pressure Stockings**
- **Oxymetazoline**
