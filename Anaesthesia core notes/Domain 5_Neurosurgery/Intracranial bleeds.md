# Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)

## Introduction

- **Definition:**
	- Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is defined as bleeding into the subarachnoid space, the area between the arachnoid and pia mater of the meninges enveloping the brain.
- **Incidence:** 9/100,000
- **Classification:**
	- 85% are from aneurysm rupture
	- 10% are from non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage (better prognosis)
	- 5% are from rare conditions such as AVMs or septic (mycotic) aneurysms

### Common Sites of Cerebral Aneurysms

1. Anterior communicating artery: 30-35%
2. Internal carotid artery: 30-35%
3. Middle cerebral artery: 20%
4. Posterior communicating artery
5. Posterior cerebellar artery
6. Superior cerebellar artery
7. Vertebral artery
8. Basilar artery: 5%

### Risk Factors for Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

- **General medical conditions:** Hypertension, pregnancy
- **Lifestyle:** Smoking, alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy
- **Prescription drugs:** Oral contraceptive pill
- **Genetic/collagen abnormalities:** Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type III, Marfan’s syndrome, polycystic kidney disease

## Clinical

### Presentation

- In 90% of cases, the presenting symptom is a sudden onset of severe headache, often described as a ‘hammer blow’.
- In 40% of cases, there is a sentinel (warning) headache some weeks before the main SAH.
- Other presenting symptoms and signs:
	- Nausea and vomiting (70%)
	- Diplopia (due to 3rd or 6th cranial nerve palsy)
	- Meningism (photophobia, neck stiffness)
	- Decrease in conscious level
	- Seizures (25%)
	- Papilloedema or retinal hemorrhages

### Special Investigations

- **ECG:**
	- 27% of patients will have T wave inversion, ST abnormalities, and Q waves. These are strongly associated with poor neurological grade but not predictive of all-cause mortality.
- **Transcranial Doppler:**
	- Higher flow velocities due to vasospasm.

### Perioperative Complications

- **Rebleeding:** Surgical prevention within 72 hours, Obstructive hydrocephalus; Seizures
- **Cerebral vasospasm:** See below.
- **Hydrocephalus:** May require drainage.
- **DND:** Treat vasospasm with CCB ± modified HHH therapy (Hypertensive, hyperaemic therapy ± haemodilution).
- **Neurogenic shock:** Dobutamine.
- **CVS:**
	- ECG changes: T wave inversion, prolonged QT, ST depression, U wave arrhythmias. Appear within 48 hours, disappear over 6 weeks.
	- Myocardial dysfunction on ECHO.
	- Neurogenic pulmonary edema.
- **Hyponatremia:** SIADH/CSWS/DI.
- **VTE:** Prevent with compressive stockings.
- **Hypertension**
- **Liver dysfunction**
- **Renal dysfunction
- **Respiratory:**
	- Pneumonia
	- ARDS
	- Neurogenic pulmonary edema
#### Cerebral Vasospasm

- **Peak incidence:** within 6-8 days of the initial event.
- **Predictors:** SAH, intraventricular hemorrhage, admission GCS < 9, age < 30
- **Pathogenesis:** Caused by substances released as SAH blood undergoes haemolysis, mostly oxyhemoglobin → disrupts endothelial cells → ↓ vasodilatory eNOS; ↑ vasoconstrictory endothelin-1.
- **Advanced Rx:**
	- Hypertensive Hyperaemic therapy ± Haemodilution (modified HHH therapy)
	- Intra-arterial vasodilator infusion of papaverine
	- Angioplasty
- **Conventional Rx:** CCB (Nimodipine) for 3 weeks

#### Delayed Cerebral Ischemia

- **DCI occurs in more than 60% of patients, with the greatest risk between days 4 and 10 after the SAH, and is associated with worse outcomes.**
	- CI and vasospasm are often assumed to be synonymous, but DCI can occur in the absence of vasospasm and often affects more than one vascular territory.
	- DCI is neurological deterioration related to ischemia (unrelated to treatment of the aneurysm) that persists for >1h and has no other cause (e.g. hydrocephalus, seizures, or metabolic).
	- Vasospasm is arterial narrowing demonstrated angiographically or with Doppler ultrasonography, with corresponding clinical symptoms and signs.
- **Risk:**
	- Poor grade SAH
	- Large subarachnoid blood load
	- Intraventricular hemorrhage
	- Smokers
- **Pathology:**
	- Pathological changes occur within intracranial arteries causing thickening of the vessel walls and narrowing of the lumen, impaired vascular relaxation, and associated impairment of vascular reactivity and autoregulation. Together these result in reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and ischemia in affected areas.
- **Diagnosis:**
	- Clinical symptoms include reduced level of consciousness, changes to speech, or the development of focal motor deficits. The onset may be sudden or insidious. Diagnosis is often difficult, particularly in patients who already have a neurological deficit or in those who are sedated.
	- Both vasospasm and DCI may be asymptomatic.
	- Transcranial Doppler, CTA, DSA
- **Treatment:**
	- Nimodipine (60 mg 4 hourly IVI): Safe and cost-effective treatment to prevent DCI and improve outcome after SAH, with level 1 evidence to support its use. Nimodipine should be started when a diagnosis of SAH is made and continued for 21 days.
	- Modified HHH: CPP >70mmHg, Euvolemia. Traditionally, a hematocrit of 0.3 was the target during triple H therapy, but current consensus recommendation is against haemodilution. Over 80% of SAH patients develop anemia. Target Hb 8-10.
	- Magnesium: Neuroprotective and vasodilatory.

## Pregnancy Management of Acute Intracranial Bleed

### Decision to Proceed

- **Less than 26 weeks gestation:** Proceed as best for mother.
- **26-34 weeks gestation:**
	- Stable patient: Proceed as best for mother.
	- Unstable patient: Caesarean section followed by aneurysm exclusion.
- **More than 34 weeks gestation:** Caesarean section followed by aneurysm exclusion.

### Induction

- Titrated to protect against rebleed vs secondary brain injury
- Blunt intubation response
	- Lidocaine, MgSO4, Fentanyl
	- Remifentanil (1 mcg/kg given over 60 seconds)
	- Esmolol (0.5-1 mg/kg)
- Accept aspiration risk
- PaCO2 should be kept between 25-30 mmHg

### Mannitol

- Risk of fetal dehydration.
- If tight head → give.
- If non-urgent indication → discuss with neurosurgery, avoid if possible.
# Aneurism and Coiling

## Introduction

- Berry aneurysms occur at vessel junctions, cerebral arteries having a weaker, less elastic muscle layer than systemic vessels.
- Association with atherosclerosis, polycystic kidneys, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, coarctation of the aorta, and Marfan’s, Ehlers-Danlos, and Klinefelter’s syndromes.
- Commonest sites are the internal carotid system (41%), the anterior cerebral artery (34%), and the middle cerebral artery (20%).
- Commoner in females and 40-60 years old.
- Aneurysms do not usually rupture until they are >5mm in diameter.
- Classic symptoms include sudden onset of severe headache with loss of consciousness, which may be transient in mild cases.
- ~20% of patients will die from SAH at the time of the initial bleed. Of those who survive to reach hospital, a further 15% will die within 24 hours, and 40% will make a good recovery.

## World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) Grading of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

|WFNS Grade|GCS Score|Motor Deficit|
|---|---|---|
|I|15|Absent|
|II|13-14|Absent|
|III|13-14|Present|
|IV|7-12|Present or absent|
|V|3-6|Present or absent|

## Considerations

### Unfamiliar/Remote Environment

- Limited help & specialized tools
- Potential prolonged patient transfers
- Limited access to patient
- Need for absolute immobility (muscle relaxant or remifentanil infusion)

### Unsecured Aneurysm

- Risk of rupture: need to avoid ↑ transmural pressure.
- Need to control hemodynamics: possible need for hypotension or sinus pause for coil placement.
- Place external pacing/defibrillator pads.

## Complications

## Surgical Considerations

- Aneurysms arising from branches of the vertebral or basilar arteries require a posterior fossa craniotomy, whereas others may be reached from a frontal or fronto-parietal approach.
- There is often a need to control the aneurysm prior to clipping by applying a temporary clip to a proximal vessel.
- Most intracranial aneurysms are currently treated by releasing Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs) into the aneurysmal lumen via microcatheters inserted in the femoral artery, until occlusion of the aneurysm is achieved. This approach is associated with better independent survival at 1 year than after craniotomy and clipping of the aneurysm. The risk of death is significantly lower in the coiled than the clipped group at 5 years. The risk of late rebleeding is acceptable, but higher, after coiling than clipping.
- Recovery should be smooth and rapid. An incompletely secured aneurysm may require control of the MAP post-operatively.

# Intracranial Hematoma

## Introduction

- **Extradural, subdural, or intracerebral:**
	- **Extradural:** Urgent evacuation is required (within an hour of pupillary dilation). Tear in the middle meningeal artery (mostly associated with skull fracture).
	- **Subdural haematoma:** Bleeding from the bridging veins between the cortex and dura. Early evacuation of an acute subdural hematoma improves outcome. Chronic subdural hematomas may occur in the elderly, often after trivial injury. They present insidiously with headaches and confusion and can be evacuated via a burr hole under LA.
	- **Intracerebral haematoma:** Occurs in hypertensive individuals, as a complication of treatment with warfarin, or as a result of bleeding from an intracranial aneurysm.
