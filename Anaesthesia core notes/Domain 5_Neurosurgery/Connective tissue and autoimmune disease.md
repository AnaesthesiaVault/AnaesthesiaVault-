# Marfans Syndrome

[Marfan's_Calgory](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Marfan-Syndrome/)

## Considerations
- **Airway problems**:
	- Possibly difficult: high arched palate 
	- Potential cervical spine (C1/2) ligamentous instability
	- TMJ laxity & potential dislocation with laryngoscopy 
- **Multisystem disease**
	- Cardiovascular dysfunction
		- Valvular disease (AI, MR, MVP)
		- Aortic arch aneurysm, aortic rupture & dissection risk 
		- MIs secondary to medial necrosis of the coronary arterioles
		- Arrhythmias & conduction defects
	- Respiratory dysfunction
		- Scoliosis, pectus carinatum/excavatum & restrictive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale
		- Spontaneous pneumothorax (bullous lung disease), emphysema 
	- Ocular: lens dislocation, retinal detachement, glaucoma
- **Potentially difficult positioning & regional anesthesia**
	- Rule out dural ectasia 
### Goals
- Minimize ↑ in aortic wall tension through avoidance of sustained ↑ in systolic BP 
- Establish airway with minimal c-spine movement
- Maintain hemodynamic goals of associated valvular lesions
- Lung protective ventilation considering restrictive lung disease & potential bullae
- Careful positioning (lax joints & potential peripheral nerve injury)
- Post-op pain (neuraxial or regional preferably), post-op disposition
- These patients are for elective aortic repair when ≥ 5cm 
### Potential Conflicts
- Coexisting aortic root dilation (need to reduce cardiac output) vs MR/AI/LV dysfunction
### Pregnancy Considerations
- If ∅ symptoms & aorta diameter < 4cm → no special considerations & vaginal delivery ok 
- If aortic root dilatation/AI → multidisciplinary management with cardiology/cardiac surgery/obstetrics 
- Some authorities recommend cesarean section for aortic diameter > 4.5cm, labor if > 4 & < 4.5cm
- **Issues**: 
	- Airway might be even more difficult 
	- Neuraxial very good option for vaginal delivery & cesarean section  
	- Aortic dilatation with risk dissection/rupture 
	- Monthly echocardiography during pregnancy 
	- Big focus is to reduce shear forces on aorta 
	- Consider very early epidural 
	- Need invasive monitoring
	- Drug therapy to prevent tachycardia & elevated BP (keep systolic < 120mmHg) = labetalol good agent
	- Avoid ergotamine due to hypertension risk 
- **Dural ectasia:** 
	- NOT an absolute contraindication to epidural placement but higher risk for failed block & dural puncture & PDPH
	- Widening of the dural sac, asymptomatic or may present with low back pain, headache, or proximal leg pain, weakness, or numbness
	- Consider CT/MRI

# Ehlers Danlos

## Background
- A type of connective tissue disorder 
- Characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, & tissue fragility
- Classified into 13 subtypes: classical, classical-like, cardiac-valvular, vascular, hypermobile, arthrochalasia, dermatosparaxis, kyphoscoliotic, Brittle Cornea syndrome, spondylodysplastic, musculocontractural, myopathic, periodontal
	- Vascular type associated with ↑ risk of death 
## Considerations
- **Multisystem disease:**
	- High risk of bleeding & friable tissue → affects ETT placement, regional techniques, invasive lines 
		- ​Desmopressin useful if bleeding 
	- Cardiovascular: mitral regurgitation, proximal aortic dilatation, conduction abnormalities
	- Spontaneous ruptures: bowel, uterus, or major arteries 
	- Skin laxity/fragility & joint hypermotility
- ↑ risk pneumothorax: keep low airway pressures 
- Regional anaesthesia is relatively contraindicated due to hematoma risk 
### Pregnancy Considerations
- Very difficult management, requires multidisciplinary effort 
- High risk of preterm labor, uterine rupture, & hemorrhage 
- Neuraxial relatively contraindicated, may need GA 
- If vascular type, recommendations are either termination of pregnancy or cesarean section before 32 weeks

# Achondroplasia

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311094408.png)

## Considerations
- **Potential difficult airway**
	- Difficult bag mask ventilation, subglottic stenosis, facial anomalies, cervical spine instability (odontoid hypoplasia)
	- Possible atlantoaxial instability (AAI) 
- **Pulmonary complications:** 
	- Kyphoscoliosis, obstructive & central sleep apnea, restrictive lung disease, possible cor pulmonale
- **Neurologic complications**:
	- Spinal stenosis, hydrocephalus (cervical kyphoscoliosis) +/- VP shunt 
- Difficult neuraxial anesthesia: kyphoscoliosis, narrow epidural space, prolapsed discs, deformed vertebral bodies 
- Difficult IV access, regional/neuraxial, monitoring & positioning 
### Goals
- Safe establishment of airway 
- Avoid neck hyperextension (brainstem compression)
- Identification & optimization of cardiorespiratory complications 
- Goals for pulmonary hypertension if applicable 
### Pregnancy Considerations
- Cesarean section required due to fetal:pelvic disproportion
- Titrated epidural (spinal spread is unpredictable) is best, but epidural may also be difficult
# Ankylosing Spondylitis

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311123041.png)

## Considerations
- Potential difficult airway
- Risk of ↓ c-spine mobility/fusion/instability 
- Atlanto-axial subluxation possible 
- **Multisystem disease with extra-articular features:** 
	- Cardiac: aortic insufficiency, myocarditis, conduction defects, cardiomegaly, cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion
	- Respiratory: restrictive lung disease from parenchymal fibrosis & chest wall musculoskeletal disease 
	- Neuro: spondylolisthesis (cord compression), uveitis
	- Heme: anemia of chronic disease 
- Difficult/impossible regional & neuraxial anesthesia due to poor positioning, axial spine fusion, epidural space obliteration, & underlying radiculopathies/neuropathic pain
	- Higher risk epidural hematoma (ASRA)
	- Paramedian might be a better approach
- Medications: NSAIDS, steroids, immunomodulators: marrow suppression, platelet dysfunction, renal impairment, need for steroid coverage, ↑ infection risk 
### Goals
- Minimize c-spine manipulation with airway management, consider AFOI, videolaryngoscopy, lighted stylet
- Management of multisystem disease features, especially cardiopulmonary 
- Patient positioning
- Recognition of difficult neuraxial & unpredictable response to neuraxial local anesthetics
### Pregnancy Considerations
- Complicated due to difficult airway & difficult neuraxial technique, have multiple plans in place
- For neuraxial: consider paramedian approach & ultrasound guidance
### Anaesthetic Considerations in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Patients

#### Preoperative Assessment

1. **History & Examination:**
	
	- Focus on disease duration, current treatments, and level of disability.
	- Consider the risk of fractures due to severe osteoporosis, particularly in the vertebrae and hips.
2. **Airway Assessment:**
	
	- **Challenges:**
		- Fixed flexion deformities of the neck and vertebral column make airway management difficult, including laryngoscopy and intubation.
		- Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) involvement restricts mouth opening.
		- Cricoarytenoid joint involvement and hoarseness may indicate airway complications, including potential laryngeal inlet distortion.
		- Risk of C5/6 spinal fractures with minimal trauma.
		- Atlanto-axial subluxation can complicate airway management.
	- **Management:**
		- Consider awake tracheal intubation (ATI) or fiberoptic intubation as preferred techniques.
		- Fiberoptic nasendoscopy may be useful for assessing cricoarytenoid involvement.
3. **Cardiorespiratory Involvement:**
	
	- **Cardiac:**
		- Monitor for aortic regurgitation, conduction abnormalities, myocarditis, pericarditis, and pericardial effusions.
		- Consider ECG and ECHO preoperatively to assess aortic root dilation and other potential issues.
	- **Respiratory:**
		- Limited chest expansion due to costo-vertebral involvement and fibrosing alveolitis may impair pulmonary function.
		- Assess for interstitial lung disease or bronchiectasis; consider preoperative pulmonary function tests (PFTs).
4. **Neurological Assessment:**
	
	- Document any existing neurological deficits, including spinal cord compression and peripheral nerve lesions.
	- Be cautious with head positioning, particularly in patients with vertebrobasilar insufficiency.
	- Consider epilepsy and assess for signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency preoperatively.

#### Intraoperative Considerations

1. **Positioning:**
	
	- Positioning, especially prone, is challenging and requires careful planning with maximal comfort for the patient.
	- Use careful padding to avoid pressure injuries, and avoid exacerbating any existing spinal deformities.
2. **Neuraxial Anesthesia:**
	
	- **Challenges:**
		- Difficult due to ossification of interspinous ligaments, ankylosis, and bony bridges.
		- Epidural space obliteration and spinal fusion may make neuraxial blocks impossible or high-risk.
	- **Approach:**
		- Consider lateral or paramedian approaches, often with ultrasound guidance, for any neuraxial anesthesia attempts.
		- Avoid epidurals due to an increased risk of epidural hematoma.
		- Caudal approaches can be considered as the sacrococcygeal membrane is typically spared.
3. **Potential for Blood Loss:**
	
	- Patients on NSAIDs may have increased blood loss risk, especially when positioned prone.
	- Manage carefully to avoid excessive intraoperative bleeding.
4. **Pharmacological Considerations:**
	
	- **Drug Therapies:**
		- Continue NSAIDs preoperatively (discontinuation may cause vascular rebound and increase myocardial infarction risk).
		- Stop methotrexate (MTX) 48 hours prior to surgery.
		- Discontinue TNF-blockers for 3-5 half-lives before surgery due to increased infection risk.
	- Be aware of the implications of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), NSAIDs, and biologicals on perioperative management.

#### Postoperative Management

1. **Analgesia:**
	
	- Multimodal analgesia (MMA) should be used.
	- Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) may be necessary if opioids are required, but this warrants close monitoring in a high-dependency unit (HDU) due to the risk of opioid-related complications.
2. **Mobilization & Respiratory Care:**
	
	- Early mobilization is crucial to avoid complications.
	- Use incentive spirometry and breathing exercises postoperatively to optimize pulmonary function.
3. **Positioning:**
	
	- Ensure the patient is positioned for maximum comfort during the postoperative period.
# Osteogenesis Imperfecta

## Background
- Rare, autosomal dominant, inherited disease of connective tissue that affects bones, the sclera, & the inner ear, bones are extremely brittle
## Considerations
- Difficult airway: ↓ C-spine mobility, fragile C-spine with fracture risk, mandibular fractures, large head, short neck, brittle teeth
- Kyphoscoliosis & pectus excavatum 
- Possible restrictive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, & RV dysfunction 
- Cardiac involvement (aortic regurgitation & mitral regurgitation)
- ↑ risk of fractures: 
	- BP cuffs may be hazardous
	- Careful positioning & padding essential 
	- Succinylcholine fasciculations may cause fractures 
- Bleeding tendency secondary to ↓ platelet function possible 
- Hypermetabolic: prone to hyperthermia but not malignant hyperthermia (MH) risk 
### Conflicts
- Full stomach/RSI vs. difficult airway  
- Regional vs. bleeding tendency 
- Monitoring/positioning vs. brittle bones 
### Pregnancy Consideration
- ↑ obstetrical risks:
	- High incidence cephalo-pelvic-disproportion → mandatory cesarean section 
	- Higher incidence intra-partum & post partum hemorrhage 
- ↑ risk uterine rupture/pelvic fracture 
- Even more difficult airway
- Succinylcholine can cause bone fractures: give defasciculating NdMR or use rocuronium 
- Potential contraindication to regional due to platelet dysfunction: if patient history reassuring along with platelet count/INR/PTT, go ahead with regional
# Rheumatoid Arthritis

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314170557.png)

### Anaesthetic Considerations for Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)

#### 1. Airway Management
- **Challenges:**
  - Limited oral opening due to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) involvement.
  - Arthritis of the cervical spine with atlantoaxial instability increases the risk of cervical spine injury during airway manipulation.
  - Fixed flexion deformities, cricoarytenoid joint involvement, and risk of C5/6 spinal fractures may complicate intubation.
  - Airway management may be difficult, requiring techniques like fiberoptic intubation.
- **Considerations:**
  - Fiberoptic intubation may be the preferred technique, especially in patients with cervical spine involvement.
  - Assess for signs of hoarseness, which may indicate cricoarytenoid arthritis.

#### 2. Respiratory Considerations
- **Pulmonary Involvement:**
  - Diffuse interstitial fibrosis, fibrosing alveolitis, and pleural disease with intrapulmonary nodules are common, leading to restrictive lung disease and limited chest expansion.
  - Reduced chest wall compliance and potential pleural effusions may impair ventilation.
  - Patients with severe respiratory involvement may require postoperative ventilation.
- **Preoperative Assessment:**
  - Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) may be required to assess baseline respiratory function.
  - Post-extubation edema is a risk due to cricoarytenitis.

#### 3. Cardiovascular Considerations
- **Involvement:**
  - RA can cause pericardial effusions, pericarditis, myocarditis, amyloidosis, and coronary artery disease.
  - Aortic regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, restrictive pericarditis, and left ventricular failure are significant risks.
  - Increased risk of cardiovascular events, especially in patients with seropositive disease (Rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies), heart failure, or rheumatoid cachexia.
- **Preoperative Management:**
  - Conduct ECG and echocardiogram (ECHO) for cardiac assessment.
  - Consider increased red-cell transfusion requirements due to pre-existing anaemia.

#### 4. Haematological and Drug Considerations
- **Anaemia:**
  - Normocytic normochromic anaemia and iron deficiency anaemia are common, especially with chronic disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use.
  - Increased risk of gastrointestinal and renal complications due to NSAIDs.
- **Immunosuppression and Steroid Use:**
  - Long-term steroid use (e.g., glucocorticoids) necessitates supplementation during surgery to avoid adrenal insufficiency.
  - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biological agents increase the risk of infection, particularly during prosthesis insertion.
- **Drug Management:**
  - Glucocorticoid supplementation may be necessary.
  - Be cautious of NSAID-related gastrointestinal and renal side effects, requiring careful monitoring.
  - Consider the potential for reduced response to regional anaesthesia due to chronic inflammation or joint deformities.

#### 5. Neurological and Ocular Considerations
- **Peripheral and Central Nervous System:**
  - Cervical spine involvement with atlantoaxial subluxation may lead to spinal cord compression, requiring careful preoperative imaging and head positioning.
  - Peripheral neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction are associated with RA.
  - Vertebrobasilar insufficiency can complicate positioning and neurological assessments.
- **Ocular Involvement:**
  - Dry eyes and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Sjogren’s syndrome) are common, requiring eye protection during anaesthesia.

#### 6. Neuraxial Anaesthesia
- **Challenges:**
  - Difficulty performing neuraxial blocks due to ossification of the interspinous ligaments, vertebral ankylosis, and spinal fusion.
  - Increased risk of higher-than-expected spinal block levels.
  - Epidural space obliteration and a higher risk of epidural haematoma complicate neuraxial techniques.
- **Approach:**
  - Paramedian approach is preferred for neuraxial techniques, but regional anaesthesia may not be possible in all cases.
  - Extreme care must be taken to avoid epidural haematoma.

#### 7. Positioning and Fragile Skin
- **Positioning Difficulties:**
  - Deformities and fixation of joints make patient positioning challenging, particularly prone positioning.
  - Joint deformities and pain may limit mobility, requiring careful handling and padding.
- **Skin Fragility:**
  - Very fragile skin is prone to injury, necessitating extreme care during positioning and handling.

#### 8. Postoperative Management
- **Pain Management:**
  - Patients often experience significant pain and require multimodal analgesia.
  - Consider patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or regional techniques where feasible.
- **Ventilatory Support:**
  - Patients with significant respiratory involvement or myopathy may require postoperative ventilatory support.
- **Neurological Monitoring:**
  - Postoperative neurological damage, especially in those with cervical spine instability, should be closely monitored.

This comprehensive summary outlines the critical anaesthetic considerations for managing patients with rheumatoid arthritis, addressing preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care to mitigate risks associated with airway, cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and musculoskeletal involvement.

## Considerations
- Potential for difficult airway & unstable c-spine:
	- TMJ involvement, atlanto-axial instability (AAI)*, cricoarytenoid arthritis  
- Multisystem disease:
	- Respiratory: interstitial fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, pleural effusions
	- Cardiovascular: pericarditis, AI, pericardial effusions, conduction system defects, LV dysfunction, accelerated CAD 
	- CNS: peripheral neuropathy resulting from nerve compression, carpal tunnel syndrome, & tarsal tunnel syndrome are common, chronic pain
	- Renal: chronic renal failure possible (drugs, amyloidosis, vasculitis)
	- Heme: chronic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia (Felty’s syndrome)
- Medication side effects: corticosteroids, NSAIDs, immunosuppressives (cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate), stress dose steroids if needed 
- Technical difficulties with lines & patient positioning, fragile skin

#### Musculoskeletal Changes
**• Cricoarytenoid joint involvement** → dyspnoea, stridor, hoarseness ± severe upper airway obstruction
**• Laryngeal mass** (also 2° to Cricoarytenoid RA) → significant destruction of surrounding structures
**• Laryngeal amyloidosis** and rheumatoid nodules → laryngeal obstruction
**• TMJ involvement** →  limitated mouth opening ⇒ direct laryngoscopy impossible!
**• Atlanto-axial subluxation**
#### Cervical Spine Instability
**Anterior (more common)** - C1 moves forward on C2 due to transverse ligament destruction ⇒ spinal cord compression. ∴ Avoid neck flexion (e.g. Pillow). Advisable to keep the upper c-spine supported whilst the head is not moved anteriorly, e.g. using a doughnut head ring. Direct laryngoscopy should be tolerated.
**Posterior** - C1 moves backward on C2 due to odontoid peg destruction. ∴ Avoid neck extension → avoid direct laryngoscopy. Keep c-spine flexed. Consider ATI.

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311144613.png)

### Goals
- Safe establishment of airway & preservation of c-spine integrity
- Careful positioning & documentation of pre-existing neurologic symptoms
- Rule out systemic disease & manage any existing abnormalities, especially cardiopulmonary
### Pregnancy Considerations
- Obstetric management: vaginal delivery is preferred, cesarean section is reserved for obstetrical indications 
- Anesthesia: 
	- Regional definitely ok if platelets within normal limits 
	- Document pre-existing injuries 
	- If GA: very cautious airway management!!
### Approach to AAI
- Indications for X-ray are controversial 
- Indications suggested in literature: 
	- Severe disease requiring steroids, methotrexate, & immunosuppressants 
	- Obvious symptoms 
	- Disease >10 years 
- On X-ray distance from the anterior arch of the atlas to the odontoid process > 3 mm confirms the presence of atlantoaxial subluxation
- This abnormality is important, because the displaced odontoid process can compress the cervical spinal cord or medulla or occlude the vertebral arteries. When atlantoaxial subluxation is present, care must be taken to minimize movement of the head & neck during direct laryngoscopy to avoid further displacement of the odontoid process & damage to the spinal cord. It is helpful to evaluate preoperatively whether there is interference with vertebral artery blood flow during flexion, extension, or rotation of the head & cervical spine. This can be accomplished by having the awake patient demonstrate head movement or positioning that can be tolerated without discomfort or other symptoms.
# Scleroderma

## Considerations
- Potential difficult airway (microstomia, ↓ neck mobility, bleeding nasal/oral telangiectasia)
- Aspiration risk (esophageal dysmotility, hypotonic lower esophageal sphincter)
- **Multi-system disease:**
	- Cardiovascular: hypertension, coronary disease, myocardial fibrosis & LV failure, arrhythmia
	- Resp: restrictive lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale
	- Renal failure & “renal crisis”
	- Skin: raynaud's, vasoconstriction, sensitive to cold:
		- ​Radial arterial line may be contraindicated 
- Consequences of dermal thickening, contractures:
	- Difficult vascular access/positioning/monitoring
	- Nerve entrapment/pain syndromes
- Medications: immunosuppressant, vasodilators (ACE inhibitors), pain medications 
#### Anesthetic Considerations

- **Raynaud’s phenomenon**: Peripheral vasoconstriction → Avoid hypothermia
- **Dermal thickening, calcifications, contractures**: Peripheral IV difficulties
- **Skin tightening, microstomia, decreased neck flexibility**: Difficult airway management (consider AFOI - awake fiberoptic intubation)
- **Telangiectasias**: Oral or nasal bleeding
- **Esophageal dilatation, decreased LES tone**: Aspiration risk
- **Intestinal malabsorption**: Decreased vitamin K-dependent clotting factors
- **Restrictive pulmonary disease**: Increased positive airway pressure, increased oxygen concentration, potential extubation delays
- **Myocardial fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension**: Ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, conduction defects, coronary vasospasm → Invasive monitoring may be necessary
- **Renal disease**: Hypertension, decreased renal clearance

**NB**: Use regional anesthesia if possible, provided coagulation status allows.
### Anesthetic Goals/Issues
- Secure airway safely & avoid aspiration:
	- Potential difficulty with bag mask ventilation, laryngoscopy & surgical technique
	- Consider regional over GA
- Recognize several potential precipitants for hemodynamic instability:
	- Volume depletion, hypertension 
	- Myocardial dysfunction, arrythmia, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale
- Avoid precipitants of:
	- Vasoconstriction episodes: e.g., hypothermia, sympathetic stimulation
	- Pulmonary hypertension 
- Address pulmonary disease
- Potential for hypoxemia (fibrosis), acute lung injury/barotrauma (restrictive lung disease) 
- Post-op ventilation
### Conflicts
- Aspiration vs. cardiac disease & hemodynamic instability
- Aspiration vs. difficult airway
- ? difficult regional vs. risk of post-op ventilation
- TEE vs compromised esophagus 
### Treatment of Limb Raynaud's Crisis Due to Arterial Line
- Emergency situation 
- Warm limb 
- Consult vascular surgery 
- Consider sympathetic block (i.e., stellate ganglion) 
### Pregnancy Considerations
- Essentially as above 
- Very careful airway management & aspiration prevention 
- Possible prolonged neural blockade reported in literature so very carefully titrated epidural warranted
# Stevens-Johnson Syndrome

## Considerations
- Severe life threatening drug reaction with high morbidity/mortality 
- Possible difficult airway (edema & ulcerations)
- **Respiratory:**
	- Hypoxia
	- Hypersecretions
	- Pulmonary edema & ARDS
	- Blebs & pneumothorax
	- Tracheobronchitis
- **Cardiovascular:** 
	- Septic shock common cause of death
	- Hypovolemia, third spacing 
- **Renal:** electrolyte abnormalities, renal failure
- Significant pain requiring multimodal analgesia 
### Treatment
- Transfer to ICU/burn unit 
- Institute supportive care:
	- Fluid & electrolyte management (fluids: use parkland formula in acute phase)
	- Analgesia 
	- Nutritional support
	- Temperature management 
	- Antibiotics for superinfections 
- Adjunctive therapies (all controversial, no good evidence):
	- Steroids if indicated 
	- IVIG
	- Cyclosporine
	- Plasmapheresis
	- Anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies
# Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

## Introduction

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314172006.png)

## Considerations
### Preoperative Management for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

#### History

- Review the disease activity index, organ damage, and drug history, particularly focusing on steroids, immunosuppressants, antimalarials, NSAIDs, and anticoagulants.

#### Examination

- Comprehensive cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological assessments, including testing for **atlantoaxial subluxation**, joint and skin manifestations, and systemic complications.

#### Airway

- Generally no issues, but assess for:
	- Mouth ulcers
	- Subglottic stenosis
	- Cervical spine (C-spine) and cricoarytenoid arthritis
	- Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsies

#### Cardiovascular (CVS)

- Increased risk of **pericarditis** (effusions), **myocarditis** (conduction defects, heart failure), and **endocarditis** (aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation).
- Higher prevalence of **coronary artery disease** (CAD) and **Raynaud's phenomenon**.

#### Respiratory

- Higher incidence of infections, **pulmonary embolism (PE)**, **pleuritis**, **pleural effusions**, and **fibrotic lung disease**.

#### Neurological

- Risk of **cranial and peripheral nerve lesions** (due to arteritis and ischemia).
- Potential for **depression**, **psychosis**, **seizures**, and increased risk of **stroke** with antiphospholipid antibodies.

#### Renal

- **Lupus nephritis** and progression to **chronic renal failure**.

#### Hepatic

- Possible **liver dysfunction**.

#### Hematological

- Risk of **clotting disorders** or **hypercoagulable states**.
- **Thrombocytopenia** and **prolonged aPTT** common.
- Note: **Antiphospholipid syndrome** present in one-third of patients, leading to a hypercoagulable state despite prolonged aPTT.

#### Investigations

- **Full Blood Count (FBC)**: Assess for **anemia**, **thrombocytopenia**, and **leucopenia**.
- **Serum Electrolytes, Creatinine, Urea**: Renal function assessment for lupus nephritis.
- **Liver Function Tests**: Screen for drug-induced or autoimmune hepatotoxicity.
- **Coagulation Studies**: Investigate for **prolonged aPTT** and **lupus anticoagulant**.
- **Anti-dsDNA and Complement Levels**: Reflect lupus activity based on baseline comparisons.
- **Urinalysis**: Check for **proteinuria**, **red cells**, and **cellular casts** as indicators of renal involvement.
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Assess for **silent ischemia**, **myocarditis**, **pericarditis**, and **conduction abnormalities**.
- **Chest Radiograph**: Look for **pleural effusion**, **interstitial pneumonitis**, **pericardial effusion**, or **subglottic stenosis**.

### Intraoperative Management for SLE

#### Airway

- **Generally not problematic**, but assess for:
	- **C-spine and cricoarytenoid arthritis**
	- **Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy**
	- Minimize airway manipulation to reduce the risk of **inflammation** and **post-extubation airway edema**.
	- Be aware of potential **vocal cord paralysis**, **subglottic stenosis**, or **laryngeal edema** making intubation challenging.
	- **Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA)** use can help reduce airway trauma in susceptible patients.

#### Cardiac

- **5-lead electrocardiography** and **intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring** to observe for:
	- **Pericarditis**, **endocarditis**, **valvular vegetations**
	- **Conduction defects**
	- **Accelerated coronary artery disease**

#### Temperature

- Maintain **normothermia** to prevent Raynaud's phenomenon, as **hypothermia** can induce vasospasm in these patients.

#### Respiratory

- Monitor for:
	- **Pleuritis, pleural effusion**
	- **Interstitial lung disease**

#### Renal

- Maintain **renal protective strategies**:
	- **Monitor for lupus nephritis**
	- **Ensure adequate urine output and avoid hypotension.**
	- **Use nephrotoxic drugs with caution.**

#### Hematological

- **Anemia** and **thrombocytopenia** are common.
- Assess **platelets** and **APTT** preoperatively, especially before administering spinal or neuraxial anesthesia. If **APTT is raised**, consult with hematology regarding the safety of neuraxial anesthesia.
- **Antithrombotic prophylaxis** is crucial in patients with **antiphospholipid syndrome** or previous thromboembolic events. Consult with a hematologist for therapeutic anticoagulation management.

#### Immunosuppression

- Higher risk of infection due to **immunosuppressive therapy**, necessitating **strict asepsis**.
- Consider **steroid supplementation** in patients on long-term corticosteroids to prevent **adrenal suppression**.

#### Muscle Relaxants

- Exercise caution with **muscle relaxants**, particularly with medications like **azathioprine** and **cyclophosphamide**, which may interact.

#### Regional Anesthesia

- **Document any neuropathies** prior to neuraxial or regional anesthesia.
- Review **coagulation status** before proceeding with regional anesthesia, ensuring safe levels of platelets and APTT.

#### Patient Positioning

- Ensure careful positioning due to the risk of **peripheral neuropathies** and **osteoporosis**.

#### Eye Protection

- Protect against **corneal abrasions**, especially in patients with **Sjogren’s syndrome**.

### Postoperative Management for SLE

### Pregnancy Considerations
- ↑ risk of preterm labour & intrauterine fetal death
- Multidisciplinary management: rheumatology, obstetrics, anesthesia 
- Potential coagulopathy may contraindicate use of neuraxial → ensure early hematology consult 
	- ↑ PTT can have 2 causes: 
		- Presence of lupus anticoagulant: just a lab abN so clinically ok for neuraxial, these patients can actually be hyper-coagulable 
		- Autoantibodies against specific coagulation factors (e.g., VIII, IX, XII): risk of true coagulopathy → neuraxial contraindicated  
- Document any pre-existing central or peripheral sensorimotor & autonomic neuropathies prior to regional technniques
- Potential for neonatal lupus & congenital heart block
# Wegener's Granulomatosis

## Considerations
- Potential difficult airway: laryngeal stenosis, subglottic stenosis, tracheal stenosis, friable bleeding tissue
- **Multisystem granulomatous disease:**
	- CNS: cerebral aneurysms, peripheral neuropathy
	- Cardiovascular: cardiac valve destruction, conduction defects, myocardial ischemia
	- Pulmonary: sinusitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, hemoptysis, & bronchial destruction
	- Renal: hematuria, renal failure
- Possible contraindication to arterial line due to peripheral arteritis
- Medications including immunosupressants
### Goals & Conflicts
- Careful airway management
- Document neurologic deficits prior to regional techniques
- May present with massive hemoptysis & require emergency lung isolation
## Anaesthetic Management
### Systemic Pathological Features and Anaesthetic Implications

#### 1. Nervous System
- **Pathological Features**:
  - Short and stenosed carotid arteries
  - Cerebrovascular accidents
- **Anaesthetic Implications**:
  - Maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)
  - Neutral head position
  - Hemodynamic monitoring
  - Maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP)
  - Monitor for perioperative myocardial infarction (MI)
  - Prevent stress response

#### 2. Cardiovascular System
- **Pathological Features**:
  - Multiple arterial occlusion
  - Pulseless disease
  - Hypertensive heart disease
  - Coronary artery, endocardial, and vascular disease
- **Anaesthetic Implications**:
  - Maintain MAP
  - Hemodynamic monitoring
  - Prevent perioperative MI
  - Prevent stress response

#### 3. Pulmonary System
- **Pathological Features**:
  - Pulmonary artery hypertension
  - Pulmonary artery narrowing
- **Anaesthetic Implications**:
  - Avoid factors increasing pulmonary vascular resistance

#### 4. Musculoskeletal System
- **Pathological Features**:
  - Ankylosing spondylitis
  - Rheumatoid arthritis
- **Anaesthetic Implications**:
  - Difficult airway and careful head and neck positioning
  - Limited joint mobility

#### 5. Renal System
- **Pathological Features**:
  - Renal artery stenosis
  - Renal hypertension
- **Anaesthetic Implications**:
  - Maintain MAP
  - Consider renal protection strategies

#### 6. Endocrine System
- **Pathological Features**:
  - Adrenal suppression due to chronic steroid therapy
- **Anaesthetic Implications**:
  - Perioperative steroid replacement

**Monitoring:** TKA^ - difficult A-line due to impalpable pulses → use US; monitor UL + LL due to differences
**Neck:** Prone to ischaemic events from carotid stenosis → Avoid hyperextension, tight neck tube ties; maintain CPP 
**BP:** TKA - Avoid BP spikes → can cause aortic dissection / cerebral haemorrhage → premed to obtund intubation response, but maintain MAP
**Regional:** TKA - Aids BP control, permits neurological assessement. GPA* - Avoids manipulating airway (upper airway granulomas, tracheal stenoses, lung nodules)  
**Treatment:** Continue steroid supplementation, standard DVT prophylaxis
