## Background
- Failure of the developing spine to completely enclose the neural elements in a bony canal.
- May be associated with Chiari II malformation.

### Spina Bifida Occulta
- Failed fusion of the neural arch without herniation of the meninges or neural elements.
- Defect typically limited to a single vertebra (L5 or S1).
- Very common (5% to 36% of the population), can be considered a normal variant.

### Spina Bifida Cystica
- Failed closure of the neural arch with herniation of the meninges (meningocele) or meninges and neural elements (myelomeningocele) through the vertebral defect.

### Myelomeningocele
- Progressive neurologic disease producing orthopedic, neurologic, and genitourinary complications.
#### Anatomical Characteristics
- Most common neural tube defect, characterized by a cleft in the vertebral column with a corresponding defect in the skin, exposing the meninges and spinal cord.
#### Incidence
- 1-6 per 1000 live births.
#### Associated Problems
- Weakness and sensory loss of lower extremities; bowel/bladder dysfunction, depending on lesion level.
- Commonly associated with Chiari II malformation (80-90%: downward displacement of cerebellum, medulla, and 4th ventricle) ± hydrocephalus (HCP).
- Higher incidence of intestinal malformations, renal anomalies, cardiac malformations, and tracheoesophageal fistula.

## Anaesthesia for Myelomeningocele Repair
### Preoperative Concerns
- **CNS:** Site of lesion, Chiari II malformation ± HCP.
- **Cardiac:** Echocardiogram.
- **GI and GU:** Evaluation.
- **Airway:** Swallowing difficulties, stridor, short trachea (CXR).

### Intraoperative Management
1. **Positioning for induction:**
   - Use a donut cushion to avoid trauma to the neuroplaque.
   - Head stabilization may be needed if HCP causes enlargement.
   - Caution if Chiari II malformation is present, as manipulation may compress the spinal cord and brainstem.
2. **Induction:**
   - IV or gas induction can be used. Succinylcholine is permissible.
   - Judicious use of narcotics.
3. **Neuromuscular Blockade:**
   - Depends on if neuromonitoring will be used.
4. **Monitoring:**
   - Monitor urine output and replace insensible losses.
5. **Temperature Management:**
   - Maintain normothermia.
6. **Positioning Issues:**
   - Ensure airway, IV access, pressure points, and monitor for periorbital edema.

### Postoperative Care
- Consider keeping the patient intubated in ICU due to age, possibility of abnormal response to hypoxia from Chiari malformation, and lung restriction from kyphoscoliosis.
- Postoperative cardiac arrest is not infrequent.

### Occult Spinal Dysraphism
- Intermediate group of conditions wherein the bony defect is associated with one or more anomalies of the spinal cord, including intraspinal lipomas, dermal sinus tracts, dermoid cysts, fibrous bands, and diastematomyelia (split cord).
- Differentiated from the more benign spina bifida occulta.
- May have no neurologic symptoms or may have minor sensory, motor, and functional deficits of the lower limbs, bowel, and bladder; also may have orthopedic issues, such as scoliosis, limb pain, and lower extremity abnormalities.
- Patients with cord abnormalities have cutaneous stigmata in 50% of cases, and 70% have tethered spinal cord.

## Considerations for Anaesthesia
- **Need for neuroimaging/detailed neurological history & physical exam prior to neuraxial anesthesia:**
  - Look for hair tufts, dimples, hyperpigmented lesions, cutaneous lipomas over the spine.
  - If present, send for imaging prior to neuraxial anesthesia or consider general anesthesia only.
- **CNS:**
  - Hydrocephalus & risk of increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
  - Many have VP shunt.
  - Flaccid paralysis usually high lumbar/low thoracic.
  - Potential for autonomic hyperreflexia if lesion is between T5-T8.
  - Bowel & bladder control dysfunction.
- **Respiratory:**
  - Scoliosis with restrictive lung disease, risk of pulmonary hypertension/right ventricular failure.
- **Cardiovascular:**
  - Possible congenital heart disease.
- **Increased incidence of latex allergy.**

## Pregnancy Considerations
### Spina Bifida Occulta
- Neuraxial anesthesia is generally safe.
- Recommend inserting the needle remote from the site of malformation seen on imaging.
- Patients are at higher risk of post-dural puncture headache.

### Meningocele and Myelomeningocele
- If spinal level involvement is T11 or higher, painless labor is likely.
- Epidural and spinal anesthesia have been performed in literature, so they are not absolute contraindications but may be difficult and unreliable.
- Epidural placement may be needed to avoid autonomic hyperreflexia during labor.

# Specific Surgical Procedures in Spina Bifida

## Closure of a Myelomeningocele

### Timing and Challenges
- **Timing**: Typically performed within 72 hours of birth.
- **Challenges**: Neonatal and neurosurgical anaesthesia.

### Preoperative Considerations
- **Neurosurgical Discussion**: Assess hydrocephalus severity and CSF diversion needs.
- **Closure Strategy**: Determine the closure method.

### Intraoperative Management
- **Primary Closure**: Minimal blood loss expected.
- **Local Advancement Tissue Flap**:
  - Cross-match blood.
  - Prepare for invasive arterial monitoring due to potential significant blood loss.
- **Ventilation**: Primary closure may increase airway pressures.
  - Communication with surgeon is critical.
  - Reduce suture tension if airway pressure affects extubation.

### Postoperative Care
- **Neonatal High Dependency Unit**: Required for postoperative monitoring.
- **Respiratory Monitoring**: Close observation of respiratory effort.
- **Positioning**: Patients generally nursed prone.
- **ICP Monitoring**: Increased risk post-closure.
- **Analgesia**: Titrate using neonatal pain score; consider the repair site sensation.

## Posterior Fossa Decompressive Craniectomy for Chiari II Release

### Surgical Strategy
- **Goal**: Increase the diameter of the foramen magnum and decompress the posterior fossa.
- **Neck Manipulation**: Avoid to prevent brainstem compression.

### Positioning and Airway Management
- **Prone Positioning and Neck Flexion**: Ensure careful placement and fixation of the tracheal tube to avoid endobronchial migration.

### Intraoperative Considerations
- **Blood Loss**: Rapid and challenging haemostasis.
  - Ensure availability of blood products.
  - Prepare for massive transfusion and use a fluid warmer.
- **CSF Decompression**: Can cause brainstem traction leading to bradycardia and asystole.
  - Alert neurosurgical team during haemodynamic instability.
  - Adrenaline infusion and central venous access should be considered.

## Tethered Cord Release

### Condition and Diagnosis
- **Tethered Cord Syndrome**: Filum terminale attached to inelastic structures, limiting cord movement and causing potential damage.
- **Diagnosis**: Confirmed with MRI.

### Surgical Indications
- **Clinical Signs**: Surgery performed if deterioration signs are present.

### Intraoperative Management
- **Neurophysiological Monitoring**: Omit neuromuscular blocking and volatile anaesthetic agents.
- **MAP Control**: Maintain age-appropriate spinal cord perfusion pressure.
- **Temperature Management**: Critical due to prolonged procedure and patient exposure.

### Postoperative Care
- **Dura Opening**: Possible CSF leakage postoperatively.

## Spinal Surgery

### Scoliosis and Spina Bifida
- **Prevalence**: Affects at least 30% of patients with SB.
- **Complications**: Higher risk compared to non-SB patients, including infection, instrumentation failure, and non-union.

### Surgical Approaches
- **Anterior Approach**: May require one-lung ventilation.
- **Parental Counseling**: Inform about increased risks.

### Kyphectomy
- **Indications**: Performed to improve sitting position and reduce pressure ulcer risk.
- **Challenges**: High risk, especially for patients with thoracic kyphosis.

### Preoperative Assessment
- **Lung and Heart Function**: Assess for restrictive lung defects and right heart function to determine surgical fitness.

### Intraoperative Considerations
- **Blood Loss and Haemodynamic Instability**: Significant risk.
- **Spinal Cord Signals**: Risk of decreased or loss of signals.
  - Implement local protocol for management including MAP, haemoglobin, and corticosteroid use.

### Postoperative Management
- **Wound and Instrumentation**: Significant risk of breakdown, infection, and failure.
  - Multiple returns to the operating theatre may be required.
- **Analgesia**: Essential for early transfer and positional change.
- **ICU Admission**: Strongly advised for postoperative care.
