# General Anaesthetic Considerations for Patients with Neurosurgical Implants

## Preoperative Assessment
1. **Neurological Status**:
   - Assess the patient's baseline neurological status, including **Glasgow Coma Score (GCS)** and any pre-existing **focal deficits**.
   - Document any features that suggest **elevated intracranial pressure (ICP)**, such as:
	 - New or worsening headache
	 - New neurological deficits
	 - New onset or increased frequency of seizures
2. **Signs of Raised ICP**:
   - **Headache**: Often postural, worsens when recumbent or straining, possibly associated with nausea and vomiting.
	 - Caused by traction on cerebral blood vessels or dura mater.
   - **Neurological symptoms**: Papilloedema, decreased consciousness, or worsening neurological deficits.
   - Concerns of elevated ICP include the risk of **brain herniation**:
	 - **Transtentorial herniation**: Causes ipsilateral midriasis, contralateral hemiplegia.
	 - **Tonsillar herniation**: Compresses the brainstem, potentially leading to respiratory or cardiac arrest.
	 - **Late-stage signs**: Cushing’s triad (hypertension, bradycardia, widened pulse pressure) and abnormal respiratory patterns (Cheyne–Stokes, apnoeas).
3. **Specialist Consultation**:
   - If new signs of raised ICP develop, consult the neurosurgical specialist and delay elective procedures as necessary.
4. **Drug History**:
   - **Antiplatelets**: Important for patients with intracranial stents.
   - **Antiepileptics**: To avoid drug interactions, especially with multi-modal postoperative analgesia.
   - **Antiparkinsonian drugs**: Prevent drug interactions, particularly relevant for patients with devices like **Deep Brain Stimulators (DBS)**.
## Intraoperative Management
1. **Anaesthesia in Patients with Raised ICP**:
   - Aim to **maintain normal physiology** and prevent further ICP elevation.
   - **Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA)** using **propofol** and **remifentanil** is preferred for rapid emergence and stable cerebral metabolic rate (CMRO₂).
   - Alternatively, volatile agents are acceptable, provided **MAC** is ≤1 (up to 1.5 MAC sevoflurane) to minimize cerebral vasodilation.
   - **Nitrous oxide** should be avoided due to its adverse effects on CMRO₂ and vasodilation.

2. **For Patients with Normal ICP**:
   - If ICP is normal and the patient has a functioning shunt, secured intracranial aneurysm, or an implantable device, less invasive techniques, such as a **supraglottic airway device** and spontaneous ventilation, are well tolerated.
## Postoperative Care
1. **Standard Recovery**:
   - Standard postoperative care applies with additional **neurological observations** to monitor for any deterioration.
2. **High Dependency or Intensive Care**:
   - **Admission criteria**:
	 - Guided by the surgical procedure (e.g., oesophagectomy with DBS).
	 - New or worsening neurological symptoms warrant immediate investigation, often with imaging, and urgent neurosurgical referral.
3. **Postoperative Analgesia**:
   - Aim to minimize high-dose opioids, which can sedate the patient, **mask neurological deterioration**, or suppress ventilation.
   - **Regional anaesthesia**: Neuraxial blocks are not strictly contraindicated, but anti-platelet therapy guidelines must be followed.
   - **Adjuvant analgesics**: Pregabalin, gabapentin, clonidine, and ketamine may be considered, though sedative side effects should be monitored.
	 - **Ketamine**: Despite historical concerns, emerging evidence suggests its neuroprotective potential and safe use in adults, although this remains a controversial practice.
# Preoperative Considerations for the Anaesthetist According to the Type of Shunt Present
## General Considerations for All Types of Shunts
- **Preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)** and documentation of any focal neurological deficits, including pupil size/reactivity, to facilitate postoperative comparisons.
- **Access for Invasive Lines**: Most shunts are tunnelled behind an ear and along the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It's crucial to assess both sides of the neck for any remnants of previous shunts that may remain in situ.
### Specific Considerations Based on Shunt Type
1. **Ventriculo-peritoneal Shunt**
   - **Intra-abdominal Infection**: Signs such as infection should prompt discussions with the neurosurgical team regarding shunt infection management.
   - **Shunt Revisions**: Multiple revisions may result in intra-abdominal adhesions, complicating and potentially prolonging surgery.
2. **Ventriculo-atrial Shunt** (Distal catheter tip in the mid to lower right atrium via the internal jugular vein)
   - **Observation**: Close neurological observation post-operation is crucial as these shunts may drain higher volumes of CSF, potentially causing a rapid development of hydrocephalus compared to other shunts.
   - **Pulmonary Hypertension**: Check for signs and avoid internal jugular and subclavian lines which are generally inadvisable.
   - **Alternatives**: If necessary, consider shunt alternatives.
3. **Ventriculo-pleural Shunt** (Distal catheter tip placed in the third/fourth intercostal space via a mini thoracotomy or mini thoracostomy)
   - **Pleural Effusion**: Look for effusions on the shunt side that might be large and consider consulting with a neurosurgical center before draining.
   - **IPPV Concerns**: Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) may lead to shunt blockage, so caution is advised during anesthetic procedures to avoid this.
   - **Lung Atelectasis**: Aim to prevent postoperative lower respiratory tract infections and lung atelectasis; encourage excellent respiratory excursion post-surgery.
4. **Lumbar-peritoneal Shunt**
   - **Meningitis Risk**: There's an inherent risk of lumbar meningitis with these shunts.
   - **Spinal Canal Pressure**: Sudden increases can compromise spinal cord perfusion; hypotension should be avoided.
   - **Patient Positioning**: Ensure the patient's position does not excessively bend or pressure the tunneled portion of the shunt. When using lateral supporting bolsters, special attention is needed to avoid exerting pressure on the tunneled portions.
# Intracranial Stent Occlusion: Consequences and Management
1. **Venous Stent**
   - **Consequence of Occlusion**: Raised intracranial pressure due to reduced venous drainage.
   - **Likely Neurology when Occluded**: Postural headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbance, decreased level of consciousness (LOC), coma.
   - **Emergency Management**:
	 - Refer for thrombectomy or intrastent thrombolysis consideration.
	 - Consider glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.
2. **Carotid Stent**
   - **Consequence of Occlusion**: Ischaemic stroke.
   - **Likely Neurology when Occluded**: Ipsilateral hemisphere cerebrovascular accident (CVA), with contralateral hemiplegia.
   - **Emergency Management**:
	 - Ensure free drainage of the contralateral side to the stent.
	 - Raise arterial pressure (AP) to allow perfusion via the circle of Willis.
3. **Posterior Cerebral Artery Stent**
   - **Consequence of Occlusion**: Posterior cerebral artery syndrome.
   - **Likely Neurology when Occluded**: Contralateral hemianopia, cortical blindness, chorea, hemiballismus, contralateral hemiplegia, thalamic pain, oculomotor nerve palsy.
   - **Emergency Management**:
	 - Refer for thrombectomy or thrombolysis consideration.
4. **Middle Cerebral Artery Stent**
   - **Consequence of Occlusion**: Middle cerebral artery syndrome.
   - **Likely Neurology when Occluded**: Contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia, contralateral ataxia, aphasia (if dominant hemisphere), contralateral hemianopia.
   - **Emergency Management**:
	 - Refer for thrombectomy or thrombolysis consideration.
5. **Anterior Cerebral Artery Stent**
   - **Consequence of Occlusion**: Anterior cerebral artery syndrome.
   - **Likely Neurology when Occluded**: Contralateral pelvic or lower limb hemiplegia or hemiparesis, apraxia, anosmia.
   - **Emergency Management**:
	 - Refer for thrombectomy or thrombolysis consideration.
## Additional Notes
- **Thrombectomy and Thrombolysis**: These are critical interventions in the management of stent occlusions. Thrombectomy physically removes the clot, while thrombolysis involves the administration of drugs to dissolve the clot.
- **Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors**: These are used to prevent the aggregation of platelets, a common causative factor in thrombosis following stent placement.
- **Raising Arterial Pressure**: This strategy helps in maintaining cerebral perfusion especially in the presence of an occluded carotid artery, utilizing the circle of Willis as a natural bypass circuit.
# Specific Anaesthetic Considerations for Cerebrospinal Fluid Diversion Devices (Shunts) and Incidental Surgery
## Overview

Patients with shunts (e.g., ventriculoperitoneal, ventriculoatrial, lumboperitoneal) often present for incidental surgeries. Below are the key anaesthetic considerations and potential complications associated with these devices during such procedures.

#### Risks and Management in Incidental Surgery
1. **Laparoscopic Surgery and Intracranial Transmission of CO2**:
	- **Concern**: Potential for pneumocephalus and increased intracranial pressure due to CO2 insufflation.
	- **Management**: It's suggested that the intra-abdominal component of a VP shunt may be displaced from the surgical field rather than clamped, as the one-way valve can withstand pressures below 300 mm Hg.
2. **Shunt Infection**:
	- **Risks**: Retrograde infective meningioencephalitis or ventriculitis due to procedural contamination.
	- **Management**: Prophylactic antibiotics should align with local hospital policies. Emergency cases with localized infection might be managed locally after consulting with the neurosurgical centre.
3. **Shunt Failure**:
	- **Risk**: Recurrence of hydrocephalus.
	- **Consideration**: Shunt function must be monitored closely, especially after procedures that may influence intracranial pressure or shunt mechanics.
4. **Postoperative Care**:
	- **Observation**: Patients should be closely monitored post-operation for any signs of shunt contamination or neurological deterioration, considering these as differential diagnoses for any arising issues
#### Specific Complications Reported
- **Ventriculo-peritoneal Shunts**:
	- Increased risk of conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery due to intra-abdominal adhesions.
	- Shunt infection rates remain unchanged by the surgical approach.
- **Ventriculo-pleural Shunts**:
	- Positive pressure ventilation may cause obstruction of ventriculo-pleural shunts.
- **Ventriculo-atrial Shunts**:
	- Potential onset of pulmonary hypertension post-insertion.
#### Intracranial Vascular Stents and Anti-Platelet Therapy

Patients with intracranial stents require careful assessment due to:

- **Thrombosis Prevention**: Long-term anti-platelet therapy is typical, starting with dual-agent therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel), followed by monotherapy with aspirin after the initial period.
- **Emergency Procedures**: If surgery is required within the first 6 weeks of stent placement, bridging anti-platelet therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors like eptifibatide may be necessary.
#### Anaesthetic Implications of Neurostimulator Devices
- **Vagal Nerve Stimulators**: Used to manage refractory epilepsy. The anaesthetic approach should consider potential interactions with anesthesia due to the modulation of neuronal excitability.
#### Considerations for Emergency and Elective Surgeries
- **MRI and Implanted Devices**: Potential risk of functional impairment due to induced electrical currents or tissue heating.
- **Cardiac and Defibrillation Procedures**: Implanted devices may be damaged by defibrillation; positioning electrodes far from the device and using minimal necessary energy is recommended.
