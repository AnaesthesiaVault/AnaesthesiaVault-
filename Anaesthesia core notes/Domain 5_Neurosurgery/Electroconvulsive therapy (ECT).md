# Introduction

- Modern Etc is streamlined by augmentation with drugs, hyperventilation, optimizing anesthesia-ECT time interval, and various stimulus parameters guided by seizure adequacy markers.
- Introduction of anesthesia for amnesia and the use of muscle relaxation to avoid dramatic motor convulsions are the initial steps in the evolution of Etc to its modern form.

## Induction Agent

- **Etomidate or Ketamine-Propofol Combination**:
  - Etomidate or a combination of ketamine and propofol may be the best method.
  - Ketamine at low doses (0.3 mg/kg) may function as an adjunct to propofol.

## Induction Agents and Seizure Quality

|Induction Agent|Dose (mg/kg)|Seizure Quality|
|---|---|---|
|**Propofol**|0.75–2.5|Shortest duration (weighted mean difference however only 9 s)|
|**Etomidate**|0.15–0.3|Duration prolonged; may reduce seizure threshold|
|**Methohexital**|0.5–1.5 (supplemented with narcotic vs single agent)|'Gold standard'|
|**Thiopental**|2–5|Duration reduced; better than propofol|
|**Ketamine**|0.7–2.8|Unclear—reduced and prolonged in different studies|
|**Sevoflurane**|6–8% inspired concentration for induction. Thereafter 1–2 MAC|Comparable with thiopental; reduced seizure duration compared with methohexital|

## Induction Agents: Advantages and Disadvantages

| Induction Agent  | Advantages                                                        | Disadvantages                                                                                       |

| **Methohexital** | Long history of use                                               | Reduced availability; increasing lack of familiarity with use                                       |
| **Thiopental**   | -                                                                 | Need to reconstitute; increased dysrhythmias                                                        |
| **Ketamine**     | Resistant seizures                                                | Emergence phenomena; reduced CVS stability, and increased ICP                                       |
| **Sevoflurane**  | Difficult venous access; reduces uterine contraction in pregnancy | Extra equipment required; more time-consuming                                                       |

### Adjuvant Methods

#### Drugs

- **Dexmedetomidine**:
	
	- The addition of dexmedetomidine (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) to intravenous anesthetics may significantly blunt the acute hyper-dynamic response to Etc stimulation without prolonging recovery time or interfering with seizure duration.
	- Etc patients are not regularly screened for aneurysm risk; this blunted response may help reduce the risk of aneurysm rupture and hemorrhagic stroke during Etc.
	- When used with a barbiturate, dexmedetomidine does not change circulatory dynamics but significantly prolongs recovery time.
	- Low-dose dexmedetomidine (0.2-0.5 mg/kg) may effectively reduce hyper-dynamic responses without altering seizure duration or delaying recovery. It also decreases propofol injection pain.
- **Remifentanil**:
	
	- Remifentanil (1 mg/kg) may prolong seizure duration by induction agent dose-sparing effect.

#### Hyperventilation

- Hyperventilation during Etc can significantly alter the treatment outcome.
- It may help as an adjuvant in prolonging seizures or reducing the seizure threshold, preventing the rise in intracranial pressure, and facilitating more rapid orientation following Etc.
- No target end-tidal CO₂ specified.

#### Anesthesia-ECT Time Interval (ASTI)

- The ASTI is the time interval between the start of anesthesia injection and the start of the Etc stimulus.
- ASTI can significantly impact seizure duration and quality outcomes, with greater influence than other factors like age.
- A longer ASTI is associated with lighter anesthesia, leading to higher quality seizures. The ASTI should be extended as long as reasonably possible without increasing the risk of awareness.
- BIS (Bispectral Index) monitoring may be used to optimally time the delivery of the Etc stimulus after anesthesia induction. A higher pre-ECT BIS value correlates with higher seizure quality, resulting in fewer treatments. Seizure induction should start with a BIS value of at least 65.

#### Stimulation

- The stimulus dose in Etc is the quantity of electrical stimulus needed to produce a seizure, considered as the stimulus charge. It equals the product of the train duration, pulse frequency, pulse amplitude, and pulse width. Modifying these variables produces differing neurobiological effects on the brain.
- Dosing is determined by delivering electricity in stimulus trains of increasing duration and frequency until a seizure is obtained. Altering the duration of the stimulus train is more efficient than altering the frequency.

## Seizure Adequacy Markers

- A maximal therapeutic seizure is one of adequate duration and robust EEG expression.
- EEG ictal parameters are automatically provided by some Etc devices, allowing seizure quality to be continually evaluated.
- Important ictal indices include:
	- TSLOW (time to onset of seizure activity)
	- Peak mid-ictal amplitude
	- Regularity
	- Stereotypy
	- Maximum sustained power
	- Maximum sustained coherence
	- Peak heart rate
	- Postictal suppression
- A rating of global seizure quality (GSQ) using these indices can be used for assessing seizure threshold.
- Monitoring these indices allows for better evaluation of the efficiency of Etc than using stimulus parameters alone.
- Decreases in seizure quality, indicated by changes in EEG indices such as mid-ictal amplitude and postictal suppression, may predict increases in seizure threshold over a treatment course.

### Monitoring Etc Seizure Duration

- **Monitored** with EEG and visible muscle activity (e.g., forearm isolation).
- **Optimal seizure**: > 30 seconds.

## Physiological Effects

- Parasympathetic nervous system stimulation:
	- Bradycardia
	- Hypotension
- Sympathetic nervous system stimulation:
	- Tachycardia
	- Hypertension
- Dysrhythmias
- Increased cerebral blood flow
- Increased intracranial pressure
- Increased intraocular pressure
- Increased intragastric pressure

## Anesthesia for Etc

1. **Pre-operative Assessment**: Consent, aspiration risk, dentition, comorbidities, medications, fasting.
2. **IV Access and Monitoring**
3. **Pre-oxygenation** ± **Anticholinergic** (for parasympathetic discharge):
	- **Ventilation**: Hyperventilation lowers the seizure threshold and prolongs their duration.
4. **Induction (Ketafol) + Muscle Relaxant**:
	- Propofol + 0.2 mg/kg Ketamine.
	- Suxamethonium 0.5-1.5 mg/kg, or
	- Mivacurium 0.15 mg/kg (short-acting), or
	- Rocuronium/Vecuronium if sugammadex is available.
	- HT attenuation: Adjuncts can reduce induction dose requirements or attenuate cardiovascular response (e.g., opioids like remifentanil 1 mcg/kg over 60 sec, alfentanil, glycopyrrolate, and beta-blockers).
5. **Bite Block**: Clear for electrical stimulation and watch for activity. Consider adjuncts to blunt hyperdynamic response:
	- β-Blockers
	- Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)
	- Dexmedetomidine
	- Nitroglycerin (TNT)
6. **Ventilate until Fully Recovered**

### Etc in Pregnancy

- Etc can be used during pregnancy and may be safer than drugs.
- Prophylactic tocolytics may be needed if at risk for premature labor.
- Volatile maintenance can help relax the uterus.
- Beware of aspiration risk.
