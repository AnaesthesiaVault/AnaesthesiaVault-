# Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314151225.png)

# Introduction
- Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting over 100,000 people in the UK.
- Surgery is becoming more common in PD patients.
- PD is more prevalent in the elderly population.

## Pathophysiology
- PD is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta region of the substantia nigra.
- There is considerable dopaminergic neuronal reserve—symptoms are often not seen until around 60–80% of dopaminergic neurons have degenerated.

## Clinical
- Classical motor symptoms of parkinsonism include bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, and asymmetric resting tremor.
- Patients may also experience autonomic instability.

### Clinical Features of PD

#### Primary Motor Features
- **Resting tremor (usually asymmetrical)**: Usually at diagnosis
- **Bradykinesia**
- **Rigidity**

#### Early Non-Motor Features
- **Fatigue**: May precede diagnosis
- **Depression/anxiety**
- **Sleep disturbance**
- **Constipation**

#### Later Features

**Motor:**
- Gait change: stooped posture, shuffling gait with small steps, loss of arm-swing
- Dysphagia
- Expressionless face
- Small handwriting
- Soft speech
- Postural instability, leading to frequent falls
- **Timing**: 5–10 years after onset of symptoms

**Neuropsychiatric:**
- Cognitive disturbance: slowed cognitive speed, inattention, poor problem-solving
- Dementia
- **Timing**: Increasing likelihood as time from diagnosis increases, >80% at 20 years after diagnosis

**Autonomic:**
- Postural hypotension
- Sialorrhoea (drooling or excessive salivation)
- Urinary dysfunction
- Sexual dysfunction
- **Timing**: 5–10 years after onset of symptoms

## Common Drugs Used in Treatment

### Common Pharmacological Management of PD

#### Dopamine Agonists
- **Pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine**:
	- **Indication**: Monotherapy in early PD, adjunct to levodopa-DDI regime
	- **Side-effects**: Nausea, orthostatic hypotension, impulsive control disorders, somnolence
	- **Anaesthetic Relevance**: Risk of DAWS on acute withdrawal, parenteral transdermal preparation
- **Apomorphine**:
	- **Indication**: 'Bridging' therapy for patients unable to take/absorb anti-parkinsonian medication, adjunct to levodopa-DDI regime
	- **Side-effects**: Nausea, dyskinesias, cognitive impairment, postural instability
	- **Anaesthetic Relevance**: Subcutaneous infusion or injectable 'pen' for patients with troubling motor fluctuations, very emetogenic, risk of severe hypotension

#### Dopamine Precursors
- **Levodopa-carbidopa, levodopa-benserazide**:
	- **Indication**: Motor symptoms in established PD
	- **Side-effects**: Nausea, orthostatic hypotension, dyskinesia, hallucinations
	- **Anaesthetic Relevance**: Risk of PHS on acute withdrawal; short half-life (1.5 h)—need to continue enteral administration in prolonged procedures

#### Monoamine Oxidase B Inhibitors (MAOBIs)
- **Selegiline, rasagiline**:
	- **Indication**: Used as monotherapy in early PD, or as adjunct to levodopa-DDI regime
	- **Side-effects**: Headache, arthralgia, exacerbation of levodopa side-effects when used as adjunct
	- **Anaesthetic Relevance**: Risk of serotonin syndrome (fever, hypertension, tachycardia, agitation) with meperidine

#### Catechol-O-Methyl Transferase Inhibitors (COMTIs)
- **Entacapone, tolcapone**:
	- **Indication**: Adjunct to levodopa-DDI regime
	- **Side-effects**: Dark-coloured urine, exacerbation of levodopa side-effects
	- **Anaesthetic Relevance**: Reduce dose of other drugs metabolized by COMT pathways, e.g., epinephrine

## Withdrawal Complications
- **Parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome (PHS)**: Due to withdrawal of levodopa. Symptoms mimic those of neuroleptic malignant syndrome: muscle rigidity, fever, cardiovascular instability, altered mental status (agitation, delirium, coma). PHS carries a significant mortality, up to 20% in untreated cases.
- **Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS)**: Symptoms include anxiety, nausea, depression, pain, and orthostatic hypotension. Withdrawal of dopamine agonists should be planned electively and simultaneously replaced with levodopa-DDI regimes.

# Anaesthesia for Parkinson's Disease

There is increasing evidence that Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with an increase in perioperative mortality and morbidity, including falls, aspiration pneumonia, venous thromboembolism, respiratory failure, and an increased postoperative length of stay. Postoperative delirium is a particularly challenging problem, occurring in approximately 60% of cases.

## Goals
### Safe Airway Management
- Aspiration prophylaxis
- Modified Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI)

### Avoid Clinical Exacerbation
- Continue anti-Parkinson medications perioperatively
- Avoid anti-dopaminergic medications: droperidol, metoclopramide, methotrimeprazine

### Maximize Respiratory Function

### Prevent Delirium

## Considerations
- Elderly patients with associated comorbidities
- Potential difficult airway (temporomandibular joint and cervical spine rigidity)
- **Increased risk of peri-operative complications:**
  - Airway: airway obstruction
  - Pulmonary: aspiration (secondary to bulbar dysfunction, esophageal dysfunction, and gastroparesis) and restrictive lung disease (secondary to chest wall rigidity)
  - Cardiac: autonomic instability
  - Neurologic: worsening of neurologic symptoms and risk of postoperative delirium
- **Management of medications:**
  - Ensure perioperative use of anti-Parkinson's medications
  - Avoid medications which exacerbate/precipitate parkinsonism
  - Avoid meperidine in patients on selegiline

## Concerns
1. Timing of Anti-PD drugs
2. Drug interactions
3. Systemic manifestations of PD
4. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and Delirium

### Drug Issues
**Contraindications:**
- Phenothiazines (Prochlorperazine)
- Butyrophenones (Droperidol)
- Benzamides (Metoclopramide)
- Typical antipsychotics (Haloperidol)

**Caution:**
- Atropine
- Halothane
- Meperidine
- Adrenaline
- Fentanyl
- Alfentanil

### Medications & Parkinson's
- **Avoid drugs that precipitate or exacerbate Parkinson's disease (i.e., dopamine antagonists):**
  - Metoclopramide
  - Butyrophenones (droperidol, haloperidol)
  - Phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, methotrimeprazine)
- **Selegiline (type B MAO inhibitor):**
  - Used to prevent central breakdown of dopamine to improve Parkinson's symptoms
  - Usually safe as it is not a type A MAO inhibitor
  - Avoid meperidine in patients taking selegiline (case reports of hyperthermia, agitation, muscle rigidity, and seizures)
- **Opioids:**
  - May have increased muscle rigidity with fentanyl and morphine
  - Dystonic reactions associated with the use of alfentanil and fentanyl

### Pharmacological Contraindications and Cautions in PD
#### Contraindicated
- **Phenothiazines (prochlorperazine), Butyrophenones (droperidol), Benzamides (metoclopramide), Typical antipsychotics (haloperidol)**
  - **Effect:** All are dopamine antagonists, resulting in exacerbation of parkinsonian symptoms

#### Caution
- **Centrally acting anticholinergics (atropine)**
  - **Effect:** May precipitate central anticholinergic syndrome: confusion, somnolence, restlessness; glycopyrrolate is a safe peripherally acting alternative
- **Halothane**
  - **Effect:** Sensitizes the heart to the action of catecholamines: may potentiate levodopa-induced arrhythmias
- **Meperidine**
  - **Effect:** Interacts with selegiline (MAOBI) to precipitate serotonin syndrome
- **Direct-acting sympathomimetics in those taking MAOBIs**
  - **Effect:** Exaggerated vasoconstrictor effects
- **Epinephrine, in those taking COMTIs**
  - **Effect:** Exaggerated sympathetic response
- **Fentanyl, alfentanil**
  - **Effect:** Large doses may result in muscle rigidity

## Preoperative Management
- Patients should be warned of the potential for less-than-optimal PD symptom control during the perioperative period.

### Areas of Focus in the Anaesthetic Assessment of a PD Patient
#### Airway
- Upper airway dysfunction (due to laryngeal/pharyngeal muscle dyskinesia) contributes to retained secretions, atelectasis, aspiration, and post-extubation laryngospasm.
- Fixed flexion deformity of neck may impair laryngoscopic view.

#### Respiratory
- Restrictive pulmonary deficit due to rigidity, bradykinesia, or dyskinesia of respiratory muscles.
- Obstructive sleep apnoea is common.

#### Cardiovascular
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Orthostatic or exercise-induced hypotension due to PD or anti-parkinsonian drugs, increasing risk of intraoperative hypotension.

#### CNS
- Greater risk of postoperative delirium and hallucinations.

#### Gastrointestinal
- Dysphagia, contributing to aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition.
- Sialorrhoea (drooling) is a sign of advanced PD but is thought to be a motor symptom (impairing swallowing) rather than an excess of salivation. May need a drying agent before operation, e.g., glycopyrrolate. Antimuscarinic (e.g., neostigmine) drugs increase the viscosity of saliva, further impairing swallowing.
- Increased prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux.
- Postoperative ileus or delayed gastric emptying may result in reduced absorption of enteral anti-parkinsonian drugs.

#### Urological
- Increased risk of postoperative urinary tract infection.

### Drug Management
- The guiding principle of perioperative pharmacological management of PD patients is to maintain CNS dopamine receptor activation.
- In most cases, this can be achieved by continuing the patient’s usual anti-parkinsonian drug regime into the perioperative period:
  - Allowing patients to take their drugs up until anaesthetic induction, that is, within the ‘nil-by-mouth’ period with a sip of water.
  - Utilizing anaesthetic techniques which enable a rapid return to oral intake, for example, central neuraxial block, or by administering drugs enterally via a nasogastric tube (NB for dispersible preparations only—due to differing bioavailabilities, a 30% dose reduction is suggested if the patient usually takes modified-release preparation).
- PD patients should usually be placed first on the operating list to ensure the timing of drug administration is predictable, the risk of cancellation is minimized, and to ensure optimal early postoperative disease management.
- In emergency and/or abdominal surgery, an early decision must be made about whether enterally administered dopaminergic drugs can be continued, or whether the patient must be converted to parenteral medication:
  - Most can only be given orally, with two options for IV use:
	- Subcutaneous apomorphine infusion
	- Transdermal rotigotine

#### Summary of Drug Management
- Contact a specialist.
- Ideally continue oral medications in the usual regime.
- Only 2 parenteral options:
  - **Apomorphine:** Subcutaneous infusion.
	- Side effects: hypotension and highly emetogenic.
	- Challenge dose and then commencement preoperatively for 24-48 hours. Continue infusion until drugs can be taken orally.
  - **Rotigotine:** Transdermal.
	- Improved side effect profile, easier to use. Can be used in an emergency with online calculators for dose. Contact a specialist prior to use when possible.

## Intraoperative Management
- Regional anaesthesia. For suitable types of surgery, central neuraxial block offers many advantages.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Regional Vs General Anaesthesia
#### Central Neuraxial Block
**Advantages:**
- Intraoperative monitoring of parkinsonian symptoms
- Further oral medication may be given intraoperatively
- Earlier return to postoperative oral intake
- Reduced use of systemic opioids, which may otherwise decrease gastrointestinal absorption
- Neuromuscular blocking agents are not required, so no need for anticholinergic reversal agents

**Disadvantages:**
- Muscle rigidity may make positioning difficult
- May be technically challenging with severe resting tremor
- Risk of hypotension, especially in those with autonomic dysfunction
- Tremor will only be abolished in the areas with motor block—tremor elsewhere may hinder surgery and affect monitoring

#### General Anaesthesia
**Advantages:**
- Tremor is eliminated

**Disadvantages:**
- Postoperative nausea and vomiting may preclude adequate dosing of anti-parkinsonian medication
- General anaesthesia in combination with dysphagia and ineffective cough is more likely to result in postoperative pneumonia

### Monitoring
- A significant tremor may induce monitoring artifacts: the ECG trace may mimic atrial flutter or ventricular fibrillation, and it may be difficult to measure arterial pressure non-invasively. Excessive sweating due to autonomic dysfunction may result in poor ECG electrode contact.

### Induction and Maintenance of Anaesthesia
- Just as in the general population, propofol may cause dyskinetic movements in PD patients. However, propofol is also an anti-emetic and temporarily suppresses the parkinsonian resting tremor, and is therefore probably the best choice of induction agent in most situations. Thiopental and ketamine have been used in PD patients without harm, despite theoretical risks of exacerbation of parkinsonian symptoms and exaggerated sympathetic response, respectively. With the exception of halothane, which potentiates levod

opa-induced arrhythmias, the volatile anaesthetic agents are safe. Whichever drug is used for induction of anaesthesia, it is important that it is used judiciously: perioperative hypotension can be difficult to manage, and is especially common in the presence of autonomic dysfunction or dehydration.

#### Airway
- Sialorrhoea can complicate airway management and may be reduced with glycopyrrolate. Intubation should be considered if dysphagia is suspected. There is an increased prevalence of gastroparesis and gastroesophageal reflux disease in PD patients, which may necessitate rapid sequence induction. Laryngoscopy may be difficult in the presence of a fixed flexion deformity of the neck.

#### Neuromuscular Block
- Neuromuscular blocking drugs are safe to use in PD. However, residual block in the immediate postoperative period can mask parkinsonian symptoms, and neostigmine should be used with caution due to its thickening action on airway secretions. Rocuronium is ideal as it may be reversed by sugammadex.

#### Opioids
- Meperidine should not be used for PD patients who take selegiline, due to the risk of precipitating serotonin syndrome. While all strong opioids have been used safely in PD patients, some cases of rigidity following high doses have been published.

#### Anti-emetics
- A number of commonly used anti-emetics are contraindicated in PD, due to dopamine antagonist effects. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (e.g., ondansetron) and histamine H1-receptor antagonists (e.g., cyclizine) have fewer side-effects. Despite being a dopamine receptor antagonist, domperidone does not readily cross the BBB and so is safe to use in PD.

#### Surgical Diathermy
- PD patients with an implanted deep brain stimulator (DBS) will occasionally present for surgery. Surgical diathermy is not contraindicated but can damage the DBS leads or cause suppression or reprogramming of the neurostimulator. If surgical diathermy is necessary, the neurostimulator device should be switched off immediately before induction of anaesthesia, and bipolar diathermy should be used. Postoperatively, the neurostimulator should be checked to confirm normal function.

## Postoperative Management
- Consideration should be given to a critical care admission, especially in the presence of a poor cough or swallow, sleep apnoea, or autonomic dysfunction. An early decision should be made regarding the feasibility of using the oral route for dopaminergic medication, preferably before the patient has left the post-anaesthesia care unit.

### Delirium
- Delirium is ideally managed using both individualized measures agreed before operation and also by following local and national guidance.
- Non-pharmacological means are highly preferable, such as reorientation (explaining where the patient is, the time of day, and your role) and providing a suitable care environment.
- Where drug management is absolutely necessary, typical anti-psychotics such as haloperidol should never be used, due to their anti-dopaminergic effects; benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are considered safer in PD.
  - Quetiapine is often considered in clinical practice for troubling symptoms of psychosis, although evidence is lacking.
