![](Pasted%20image%2020240314171530.png)

## ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) Classification
### A: Complete
- No motor or sensory function is preserved in the sacral segments S4-5.

### B: Sensory Incomplete
- Sensory but not motor function is preserved below the neurologic level and includes the sacral segments (light touch or pin prick at S4-5 or deep anal pressure).
- No motor function is preserved more than three levels below the motor level on either side of the body.

### C: Motor Incomplete
- Motor function is preserved below the neurologic level.
- More than half of key muscle functions below the neurologic level of injury have a muscle grade <3 (grades 0 to 2).

### D: Motor Incomplete
- Motor function is preserved below the neurologic level.
- At least half (half or more) of key muscle functions below the neurologic level of injury have a muscle grade ≥3.

### E: Normal
- Sensation and motor function are graded as normal in all segments.
- The patient had prior deficits.

# Considerations for Emergency Trauma Patient with C/T/L-Spine Injury
## ATLS Approach
- Identify multisystem life-threatening and occult injuries.
  
## Airway Management
- Potentially difficult airway due to full stomach, C-spine injury, and uncooperative patient.
- C-spine precautions and airway protection.

## Hemodynamic Instability
- Neurogenic shock and/or hypovolemic shock.
- Maintain MAP > 85-90 to prevent secondary spinal cord injury.
- Ventilatory and hemodynamic support as needed.

## Other Considerations
- Hypothermia, coagulopathy, acidosis.
- Intoxication.
- Traumatic brain injury (TBI) with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in 25%.
- Diaphragmatic paralysis (C3-C5).
- Respiratory insufficiency with injury above T7.
- Neurogenic pulmonary edema.
- Severe autonomic nervous system abnormalities.
- Hyperkalemic arrest with succinylcholine after 24 hours.

# Goals
## Avoid Secondary Spinal Cord Injury
- Maintain spinal cord perfusion pressure with goal MAP > 85-90 (IV fluids, vasopressors).
- Prevent hypoxemia, hypotension, hyperglycemia, hyperthermia.
- Immobilization during airway management and positioning.
- Manage complications of acute spinal cord injuries.

## Neurogenic Shock Management
- Administer fluids and vasopressors.
- If bradycardic, use atropine, external pacer, pharmacologic pacing (dopamine, isoproterenol).

# Acute Spinal Cord Injury
## Differential Diagnoses
### Brown-Séquard Syndrome
- Injury to one side of the cord (hemisection).
- Loss of pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral side.
- Loss of motor function, proprioception, tactile sensation, and vibration on the ipsilateral side.

### Anterior Cord Syndrome
- Damage to the anterior spinal artery.
- Loss of motor function and pain and temperature sensation below the lesion.
- Sensation of light touch, vibration, and proprioception is partially preserved.

### Central Cord Syndrome
- Damage to the corticospinal tract.
- Weakness is more pronounced in the upper limbs than in the lower limbs.
- Commonly associated with hyperextension injury, chronic cervical spondylosis, syringomyelia, or spinal cord compression.

### Posterior Cord Syndrome
- Damage to the dorsal columns.
- Loss of proprioception, vibration, and touch below the level of the lesion.

### Conus Medullaris Syndrome
- Similar to cauda equina syndrome but can have upper or lower motor neuron lesions.

### Cauda Equina Syndrome
- Bladder and bowel dysfunction.
- Areflexic limbs due to lower motor neuron lesion affecting lumbosacral nerve roots, not the spinal cord.

### Horner's Syndrome
- Damage to the sympathetic chain.
- Lesions above T1.

### Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery Syndrome
- Symptoms include vertigo, ataxia, and vomiting.

## Phases

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314171811.png)

## Pathogenesis
**Primary Trauma:**

- Mechanisms: Compression, contusion, or shear
- Result: Damaged neural tissue of the spinal cord

**Secondary Injury:**

- Evolution: Follows primary injury (e.g., ischemia, hypoxia, inflammation, edema, apoptosis)

**Injury Types:**

1. **Complete Injury:**
	
	- Loss: Motor and sensory function below injury level with intact Bulbocavernosus reflex
	- Permanence: Permanent
2. **Incomplete Injury:**
	
	- Preservation: Partial sparing of motor or sensory function below injury level

**Clinical Syndromes:**

1. **Anterior Cord Syndrome:**
	
	- Cause: Anterior spinal artery injury, often from a vascular event
	- Symptoms: Complete loss of motor function below injury level, loss of pain, and temperature at and below the level of injury
	- Note: Often mimics complete injury
2. **Central Cord Syndrome:**
	
	- Cause: Cord compression, often with pre-existing spondylosis
	- Symptoms: Upper extremity weakness and hyperpathia, sensory loss below the level of injury, bladder retention
	- Demographics: Commonly hypertension
3. **Posterior Cord Syndrome:**
	
	- Cause: Posterior spinal artery injury
	- Symptoms: Loss of vibration, proprioception, and light touch below the level of injury, preserved motor function
4. **Brown-Séquard Syndrome:**
	
	- Cause: Complete hemicord lesion, primarily penetrating injuries
	- Symptoms: Ipsilateral loss of motor function, vibration, and proprioception below the level of injury; contralateral loss of pain and temperature below the level of injury
5. **Conus Medullaris Syndrome:**
	
	- Cause: Trauma, disc herniation, or tumour causing injury to conus medullaris
	- Symptoms: Mixed upper and lower motor neuron deficiencies, sphincter dysfunction, loss of bladder and rectal reflex, saddle anesthesia, leg weakness, and paresthesia
## Disc Herniations
**Terminology:**

- Terms such as "Disc rupture," "Disc herniation," and "Slipped disc" all refer to the same pathology.

**Pathogenesis:**

1. **Aging:**
	
	- Degeneration: Hydrophilic proteoglycans in the nucleus pulposus of the vertebral disc degenerate
	- Consequences: Reduced water uptake (dehydration) and shock-absorbing capacity
2. **Mechanical Loading:**
	
	- Effect: Compresses/tears the annulus fibrosis
3. **Nucleus Pulposus Extrusion:**
	
	- Event: Nucleus pulposus extrudes through tears in the annulus fibrosis, leading to disc rupture/herniation

**Clinical Manifestations:**

1. **Lateral Disc Herniation:**
	
	- Mechanism: Nucleus pulposus pushes out laterally, around the posterior longitudinal ligament
	- Prevalence: More common than central disc herniation
	- Impact: Physically impinges spinal nerve roots (peripheral nerves)
	- Syndromes: Radiculopathy, Cauda Equina Syndrome
2. **Central Disc Herniation:**
	
	- Mechanism: Nucleus pulposus pushes out centrally, against the posterior longitudinal ligament
	- Prevalence: Less frequent than lateral disc herniation
	- Impact: Physically compresses the spinal cord (in C/T-spine only)
	- Syndromes: Myelopathy (see relevant slide)

**Notes:**

- The cervical and lumbar spines undergo the greatest range of motion and thus are most frequently degenerate.
- Degeneration tends to happen at ages 30-40, not in the elderly, due to the dehydration of the nucleus pulposus in the elderly.
- Prevalence: 90% of lumbar disc herniations occur at L4/5 and L5/S1, while 60% of cervical disc herniations occur at C6/7.

# Definitions
## Definitions and Clinical Syndromes Associated with SCI

### ASIA Impairment Scale (Modified from the Frankel Classification)

- **A = Complete**: No sensory or motor function is preserved in the sacral segments S4-S5 (45% incidence).
- **B = Incomplete**: Preservation of sensory but not motor function below the neurological level, including the sacral segments S4-S5 (15% incidence).
- **C = Incomplete**: Preservation of motor function below the neurological level. More than half of key muscles below the neurological level have a muscle grade of <3 (10% incidence).
- **D = Incomplete**: Preservation of motor function below the neurological level. More than half of key muscles below the neurological level have a muscle grade of ≥3 (30% incidence).
- **E = Normal**: Sensory and motor function is normal.

### Neurological Level

- The level of a SCI is the lowest level of the spinal cord with normal sensation and motor function on both sides of the body.

### Tetraplegia

- This is attributable to a lesion or injury within the cervical spinal cord. There is incomplete or complete loss of motor (sensory function in the arms, the torso, pelvic organs, and the legs).

### Paraplegia

- This is attributable to a lesion or injury within the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral spinal cord. There is incomplete or complete loss of motor (sensory function of the torso, pelvic organs, and the legs). The level of injury will affect which of these are affected. Arm function is preserved.

### Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome

- The anterior spinal artery runs as a single artery anterior to the cord and supplies the anterior 2/3 of the cord. Transection therefore produces sparing of the dorsal columns, resulting in paralysis and loss of pain and temperature with preservation of proprioception, fine touch, and vibration.

### Brown-Séquard Syndrome

- This is caused by lateral cord damage. It may occur because of osteophyte impaction on half of the cord producing sensorimotor damage at the level of the injury. There is ipsilateral loss of motor function, fine touch, proprioception and vibration, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature below this level.

### Cauda Equina Syndrome

- Bladder and bowel dysfunction associated with upper motor neuron symptoms and signs in the legs caused by injury to the lumbosacral nerve roots.

### Central Cord Syndrome

- Results from bleeding, infarction, or oedema to the central grey matter of the spinal cord. This is most common in the cervical region where it presents as upper motor neuron signs in the arms with loss of pain and temperature sensation in the arms. Sacral nerve fibres are positioned laterally in the cord and the patient may demonstrate sacral sparing of sensation. This indicates incomplete cord damage and therefore offers the theoretical chance of some recovery of the cord.

### Posterior Cord Syndrome

- Produces loss of vibration and proprioception. This is associated with damage to the posterior spinal artery and is very rare.
## Level of Injury and Effect on Respiratory Function

| Level of Injury | Nerve Denervation                                                                                                   | Vital Capacity (% of Normal) | Effect on Cough      | Need for Ventilation                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Above C3        | Loss of phrenic nerves. Total diaphragmatic paralysis if bilateral C3 injury                                        | <10%                         | Absent               | Immediate and long-term ventilation                                                                                                                          |
| Between C3-C5   | Partial phrenic nerve denervation/weakness/paralysis of diaphragm                                                   | 10-30%                       | Weak/ineffective     | Ventilation required in 80% within 48 hours. Older patients may need long-term ventilation. Role of non-invasive ventilation in weaning                      |
| Above T8        | Loss of inspiratory intercostal muscles/abdominal muscles                                                           | 30-80%                       | Normal to weak cough | Short-term ventilation sometimes required because of impaired sputum clearance. If respiratory co-morbidities, may occasionally still need long-term support |
| Below T8        | Loss of abdominal muscles and lower expiratory intercostals; forced cough may be weak, especially in older patients | 80-100%                      | Normal to weak cough | Short-term ventilation occasionally required because of weak cough and impaired sputum clearance                                                             |
