# Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314173028.png)

- Can occur whenever the operative site is higher than the right atrium
- Incidence high during craniotomy in the sitting position and when the surgeon is dissecting tissues that do not allow veins to collapse despite a negative pressure within them (e.g. the emissary veins in the posterior fossa)
- N2O does not increase the risk of VAE but may worsen its outcome
# Pathophysiology
- Pulmonary microvascular occlusion, resulting in an increased physiological dead space.
- Bronchoconstriction may also develop.
- A large volume of air causes frothing within the right atrium, leading to obstruction of the RV outflow tract and a reduction in cardiac output.
- **Paradoxical air embolism**: Air emboli may enter the systemic circulation through the thebesian veins in the heart, the bronchial vessels, or a patent foramen ovale. Such defects may be small and not picked up preoperatively. Small volumes of air in the systemic circulation can have disastrous consequences. Intracardiac septal defects are an absolute contraindication to surgery in the sitting position
# Signs and Detection
- Hypotension, arrhythmias, increased PAP, decreased EtCO2, and hypoxia
- EtCO2 is generally the most useful monitor, as it is widely available and sensitive. Air embolism results in a sudden reduction in EtCO2. hyperventilation, low cardiac output, and other types of embolism will also result in reduction in EtCO2.
- Doppler ultrasound is the most sensitive non-invasive monitor. It uses ultra-high-frequency sound waves to detect changes in blood flow velocity and density. Unfortunately, it is not quantitative and does not differentiate between a massive or physiologically insignificant air embolism
- TOE allows determination of the amount of air aspirated but is more invasive, is difficult to place, and needs expertise to interpret
- Precordial or an oesophageal stethoscope to detect a ‘millwheel’ murmur. this is apparent only after massive VAE, which is usually clinically obvious
# Prevention
- Avoid the sitting position, unless essential.
- Elevate the head only as much as necessary.
- Ensure adequate blood volume to maintain a positive CVP.
- Small amounts of PEEP (5–10) may reduce the risk of air entrainment.
- A ‘G-suit’ or medical antishock trousers may be used to increase VP and reduce hypotensive episodes in patients in the sitting position
# Treatment
- Supportive
- Inform surgeon and flood operating field with fluid (stops further entrainment of air and allows the identification of open veins that can be cauterized or waxed if within bone)
- Position the operative site below the level of the heart to increase VP
- Aspirate air from the CVP line. the tip should be placed close to the junction of the SVC and the right atrium
- Support the BP with fluid and vasopressors
- If a large volume of air has been entrained and surgical conditions permit, turn the patient into the left lateral position to attempt to keep the air in the right atrium
