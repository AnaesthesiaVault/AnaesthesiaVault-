# Epilepsy and Status Epilepticus

## Introduction

**Definition**:  
Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by a predisposition to generate abnormal synchronous neuronal activity, resulting in recurrent and unpredictable interruptions of normal brain function, clinically observed as epileptic seizures.

**Diagnosis**:  
Epilepsy is typically diagnosed after two unprovoked seizures occurring at least 24 hours apart. This is because over 70% of individuals will have another seizure within four years after two non-febrile seizures, whereas only 40–50% will develop epilepsy after a single unprovoked seizure.

**Causes**:  
- Genetic
- Trauma
- Tumors
- Infection
- Degeneration
- Cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs)

## Status Epilepticus

### Definition

Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) is a common medical emergency, defined as more than 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity or sequential seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures. Treatment is recommended after 5 minutes of continuous seizure activity as spontaneous resolution is unlikely.

### Management of Seizures

#### Premonitory Stage (Prehospital or <5 min)
- **Diazepam 10–20 mg PR**, repeat once after 15 minutes
- **OR**
- **Midazolam 10 mg buccally**

#### Early Stage (5–10 min)
- **Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV**, repeat once after 10–20 minutes
- Administer usual antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) if the patient is already on treatment
- **Glucose 50 mL 50% IV** and **thiamine 250 mg IV** if alcohol abuse or malnutrition is suspected

#### Established Stage (5–30 min)
- **Phenytoin IV** 15–18 mg/kg at 50 mg/min
- **OR fosphenytoin IV** 15–20 mg phenytoin equivalents (PE)/kg at 50–100 mg PE/min
- **Phenobarbital IV** 10–15 mg/kg at 100 mg/min, or both

#### Refractory Stage (>30 min)
- General anesthesia with **propofol, thiopentone, midazolam, or ketamine**. Continue for 12–24 hours after the last clinical or EEG seizure, then taper.

## Classification of Seizures

### Generalized Seizures
- **Tonic–clonic**
- **Absence**
- **Myoclonic**
- **Clonic**
- **Tonic**
- **Atonic**

### Focal Seizures
- **Simple**
- **Complex**
- **Evolving to generalized**

### Mixed Seizures
- **Focal and generalized**

### Unclassified Seizures

## Perioperative Considerations

### Preoperative
- Assess associated comorbidities, seizure type and frequency.
- Determine current drug therapy, dosage regimes, timing of the most recent dose, and any recent changes in medication regime.
- Minimize disruption to treatment regimes and ensure the patient has taken their scheduled medication on the morning of surgery.

### Intraoperative
- Avoid drugs that are epileptogenic or interact with AEDs.

### Postoperative
- Consider high care, restart AEDs as soon after surgery as possible.

### Causes of Postoperative Seizure-Type Episodes

#### Epileptic Seizure
- Underlying epilepsy
- Post-neurosurgery
- Eclampsia
- Metabolic disturbance
- Alcohol withdrawal

#### Other Causes
- Postoperative shivering
- Acute dystonic drug reaction (e.g., from dopamine antagonists)
- Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure
- Syncopal episode

### Drug Interactions

- **Induction**: Etomidate, Ketamine
- **Inhalation**: Enflurane
- **Opioids**: Alfentanil, Meperidine, Tramadol
- **Neuromuscular Blockers (NMBs)**: Aminosteroids (e.g., -curoniums) are prone to enzyme induction from AEDs; use a nerve stimulator and neuromuscular monitoring.
- **Antiemetics**: Avoid dopamine antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines like prochlorperazine, benzamides like metoclopramide, and butyrophenones like droperidol) due to the risk of extrapyramidal effects and acute dystonic reactions.

## Common Drugs

The mechanism of epilepsy involves:

1. Loss of post-synaptic inhibition with loss of inhibitory GABA activity
2. Formation of new excitatory synaptic connections with increased release of glutamate
3. Appearance of pacemaker neurons with abnormal voltage-mediated calcium currents, leading to abnormal neuronal firing.

## Antiepileptic Drugs

**Carbamazepine**: Enzyme inducer, sodium channel blocker.

**Gabapentin**: Inhibits the alpha 2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels.

**Ethosuximide**: Blocks T-type calcium channels.

**Levetiracetam**: Modulates synaptic neurotransmitter release.

**Phenytoin**: Enzyme inducer, sodium channel blocker.

**Sodium Valproate**: Inhibitor, increases GABA activity, and sodium channel blocker.

**Benzodiazepines**: GABAergic, binds GABA A receptors increasing the effectiveness of GABA.

## Effect of Anaesthetic Agents

### IV Anaesthetics

- **Etomidate**: Increases frequency of postoperative seizures and prolongs seizures in Etc.
- **Ketamine**: Proconvulsant at low doses, anticonvulsant at high doses.

### Inhalational Anaesthetics

- **Enflurane**: Causes epileptiform changes on EEG and postoperative seizures.

### Opioids

- Proconvulsant, enhances EEG activity during seizure focus localization.
- **Alfentanil**: Potent enhancer of EEG activity.
- **Pethidine**: Metabolite (norpethidine) is proconvulsant.
- **Tramadol**: Lowers seizure threshold.

### Neuromuscular Blocking Agents (NMBs)

- Hepatic metabolism of aminosteroids is affected by antiepileptic medication liver enzyme induction/inhibition.

### Antiemetics

- Dopamine antagonists cause extrapyramidal side effects that can be confused with seizure activity.

# Anaesthesia for Epilepsy Surgery

Surgical procedures aim to abolish epileptic foci or interrupt neuronal microcircuits. Identification of the epileptic foci is done through functional neuroimaging, EEG, or ECoG (electrocorticography). Intraoperative monitoring of language and motor loci may require an awake, unintubated patient.

## Preoperative Considerations

- Use routine surgery precautions for pediatric epileptic patients.
- Patients may require multiple anesthetics for neuroradiology and placement of intracranial grid and strip for continuous monitoring.
- AEDs may need to be stopped before operation for focus localization.
- If sedative premedication and intraoperative ECoG are planned, use a reduced dose of benzodiazepine.
- Expect greater blood loss and fluid shifts in infants and young children due to larger cerebral blood volume.
- Discuss the possibility of blood transfusion with parents and ensure cross-matched blood is available.

## Intraoperative Management

- The optimal anesthetic technique depends on whether ECoG is planned.
- If ECoG is planned, use a technique that has minimal effect on cortical electrical activity, such as an opioid (fentanyl or remifentanil) with a low concentration of isoflurane or propofol.
- Avoid NMBs or allow them to wear off before cortical stimulation if planned.
- For routine surgery without ECoG, use techniques that minimize convulsion risk.
- Continue antiepileptic treatment in the perioperative period.
- Avoid cerebral venous congestion during patient positioning.
- For awake craniotomy, ensure a comfortable position and clear line of vision in front of the face.
- Insert a large-bore IV access and an arterial line due to the risk of significant blood loss.
- Restart AEDs immediately post-operation.
- Ensure HDU facilities for patients undergoing craniotomy for resection of epileptic foci or hemispherectomy.

# Anaesthetic Considerations for Special Procedures

## Neuroradiology

- Painless procedures can be performed with light or no sedation in older children.
- Use general anesthesia for younger, uncooperative children or those with significant comorbidities.

## Insertion of Vagal Nerve Stimulator

- Implantation involves placing a small electrical generator in the chest wall with leads around the left vagus nerve.
- Close ECG monitoring is mandatory due to the risk of bradycardia or transient asystole.
- Transcutaneous VNSs are being developed targeting the cutaneous branches of the left vagus nerve.

## Placement of Grid and Strip

- Monitoring electrodes are placed on the brain surface for ~1 week to identify epileptic foci before possible resection.
- The procedure involves craniotomy with risks of significant blood loss and venous air embolism.
- AEDs are not routinely stopped, but anticipate possible seizures under anesthesia or in recovery.

## Awake Craniotomy

- Considered for older, cooperative, motivated children.
- Performed under local anesthesia with or without remifentanil conscious sedation, or as the asleep-awake-asleep technique.

## Corpus Callosotomy

- Anticipate risk of bleeding and venous air embolism.
- Postoperative lethargy and somnolence are common, requiring HDU care post-operation.

## Hemispherectomy

- This procedure has the highest morbidity of all epilepsy surgeries.
- It can be prolonged with potential for significant blood loss and coagulopathy.
- Ensure availability of cross-matched blood.
