# Types of Dementia and Their Symptoms

|**Type of Dementia**|**UK Prevalence**|**Histopathology**|**Symptoms Include**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Alzheimer's Disease (AD)|62%|- Beta-amyloid plaques between neurons <br> - Tau protein clumps (neurofibrillary tangles) within nerve cell bodies <br> - Loss of cholinergic neurons|- Early: memory loss, depression <br> - Later: confusion, behavioural changes, impaired communication|
|Vascular Dementia|17%|- Secondary to acute/chronic small and large blood vessel disease of the brain <br> - Related to cerebrovascular changes: atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes|- Chronic changes dependent on the region of the brain affected <br> - Stepwise reductions in neurocognitive function with successive infarcts|
|Mixed Dementia|10%|- Most commonly a mixture of AD and vascular changes|- Most commonly a mixture of AD and vascular symptoms|
|Dementia with Lewy Bodies|4%|- Alpha-synuclein aggregations in the brain cortex|- Similar to AD, but with earlier/initial sleep and visual disturbances or Parkinsonian features|
|Frontotemporal Dementia|2%|- Various changes, often involving protein aggregations affecting the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain|- Changes in personality and behaviour, difficulties with language <br> - Develops at a younger age than AD, shorter survival|

## Approach to Dementia/Major Neurocognitive Disorder (NCD)
### 1) Changes Noticed?
- **Normal, age-related:** ↓focus, ↓cognitive speed, ↓reaction time, ↓memory
- **Mild Cognitive Impairment:** Modest ↓cognitive performance from previous, DOES NOT interfere with daily independence
- **Mild to Moderate Dementia:** More pronounced ↓cognitive performance from previous, DOES interfere with daily independence
- **Moderate to Severe Dementia:** ↓cognitive performance, difficulty with ≥1 basic activities of daily living (ADL) or ≥2 instrumental ADLs
- **Delirium:** Fluctuating course, acute onset, alteration in thinking or consciousness
### 2) Is it Dementia?
- **Normal Cognitive Decline:** Normal age-related changes
- **Mild Cognitive Impairment:** Modest cognitive decline, does not interfere with daily activities
- **Mild to Moderate Dementia:** More pronounced cognitive decline, interferes with daily activities
- **Moderate to Severe Dementia:** Significant cognitive decline, difficulty with basic activities of daily living
- **Delirium:** Fluctuating course, acute onset
### 3) Causes of Dementia (Main Causes Discussed)
- **Alzheimer's Dementia:**
	- Mechanism: Beta-secretase cleaves beta amyloid protein
	- Pathophysiology: Toxic beta amyloid plaque and tau tangle formation
	- Findings: Disrupted signaling, inflammation, hippocampal and cerebral impairment
	- Complications: ↓memory, ↓learning, ↓language skills, disorientation, inattention, total debilitation, fatal infections
- **Vascular Dementia:**
	- Mechanism: Atherosclerosis or thrombosis
	- Pathophysiology: Ischemia to areas of brain (strokes)
	- Findings: Necrosis of brain tissue in areas impacted by strokes
	- Complications: Findings vary depending on area, step-wise worsening impairment
- **Lewy Body Dementia:**
	- Mechanism: Misfolded alpha-synuclein
	- Pathophysiology: Build-ups and deposition within neurons (Lewy bodies)
	- Findings: Neuronal impairment and atrophy (especially in substantia nigra)
	- Complications: Parkinsonism, hallucinations, REM-sleep behavior disorder, total debilitation, dependence
- **Frontotemporal Dementia:**
	- Mechanism: Abnormal protein inclusions and tangles (tau) in neurons
	- Pathophysiology: Neuronal atrophy, primarily affecting the frontal and temporal lobes
	- Findings: Personality and behavioral changes, mental status changes
- **Huntington's Disease:**
	- Mechanism: Autosomal dominant disease (with anticipation) with ↑CAG repeats in Huntington gene
	- Pathophysiology: Progressive atrophy of basal ganglia and dorsal striatum + lateral ventricles expanding
	- Findings: Neuronal atrophy, primarily affecting frontal + temporal lobe atrophy
	- Complications: Chorea, cognition, mood changes, aspiration, dementia, suicide
- **Parkinson's Disease:**
	- Mechanism: Genetic mutations, environmental exposures, idiopathic cause
	- Pathophysiology: Death of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra
	- Findings: Resting tremor, rigidity, anosmia
	- Complications: Depression, dementia, falls

## Intra-op
- Prioritize to avoid prolonged fasting, dehydration, sleep and meds disruption
- Orientate into OT
- Regional vs GA - no clear benefit → use lowest effective dose of shortest acting drugs, expecting prolonged onset/offset
- Avoid centrally active drugs: BZD's, Cyclizine, Tramadol
- Some evidence for processed EEG (controversial) ± NIRS
## Post-op
- Proactive multi-component non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. HELP program)
- Proactive management of pain and non-cognitive aspects (frailty (positioning, P° care, nutrition), comorbidity (inochronotropicity, volaemia, anaemia, airway, ventilation, ABG), polypharmacy (interactions))
- Pharmacological: Haloperidol in 0.5mg increments (controversial). BZD's for alcohol-related delirium / Parkinsonian dementia. No evidence for prophylaxis.
