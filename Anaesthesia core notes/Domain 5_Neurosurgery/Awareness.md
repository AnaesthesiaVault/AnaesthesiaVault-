# Incidence of Awareness

- Incidence ranges from 1:600 to 1:17,000, depending on the study methodology.
- Structured interviews suggest a higher incidence rate of approximately 1:1,000, consistent with findings from the NAP5 (5th National Audit Project).

# Definition of Awareness

- **AAGA (Accidental Awareness under General Anaesthesia)**: Occurs when a patient becomes conscious of some or all intraoperative events and has explicit recall of them.
	
- **Anaesthesia Awareness**: The state in which a patient under general anaesthesia is aware of events during surgery or a procedure and has recall of those events.

# Monitoring Depth of Anaesthesia

## Depth of Anaesthesia

- **Autonomic Responses**: Changes in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR).
- **Somatic Responses**: Tearing and sweating.
- **Movement or EMG Analysis**.
- **Isolated Forearm Technique** (practical only in research settings).
- **EEG (Electroencephalogram)**:
	- **Compressed Spectral Array**: Uses Fourier analysis to examine EEG sections, expressing total power within each frequency, e.g., spectral edge (95% of power below a specific frequency) and median frequency.
	- **Bispectral Array**: Assesses phase and power relationships between frequencies, focusing on biocoherence.
	- **Entropy**: Measures disorder within the system.
	- **Burst Suppression**: Indicative of deep anaesthesia.
	- **Evoked Potentials**: Somatosensory and auditory responses, both of which reduce with increasing depth of anaesthesia.
	- **BIS (Bispectral Index)**: Combines the above EEG parameters into a single index, though its algorithms remain proprietary.

## Detection of Awareness

- **Isolated Forearm Technique (IFT)**: Allows patients to respond to commands under anaesthesia without recall.
- **Questionnaires**: Modified Brice questionnaire.
- **Spontaneous Reporting**.

### Movement and Awareness

- Movement is neither sensitive nor specific for awareness detection.
- Not applicable in patients with neuromuscular blockade (NMB).
- Patients who respond to commands via IFT typically do not have recall but may fail to move in response to noxious stimuli (e.g., laryngoscopy), despite being able to move upon command.
- Some patients experience AAGA without spontaneous movement or paralysis.

### Depth and Outcomes

- The BALANCE trial found no evidence that targeting BIS 50 or 35 alters mortality or the risk of serious complications.

# Risk Factors for Awareness

- Use of thiopentone for induction followed by volatile anaesthetic maintenance.
- Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI).
- Obesity.
- Difficult airway management.
- Use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA).
- Interruptions in anaesthetic delivery during patient transport.
- Female sex.
- Young adults (but not children).
- Anaesthetist seniority (junior anaesthetists may pose higher risk).
- Previous history of intraoperative awareness.
- Out-of-hours surgery.
- Emergency operations.
- Certain surgeries (obstetric, cardiac, thoracic).

# Evidence from Clinical Trials

**1. B-Aware Trial (2004)**
- **Number of Patients**: 2,463
- **Target Population**: High risk for AAGA
- **Incidence of AAGA**: 0.17% in BIS group vs. 0.91% in routine care group
- **Study Design**: Multicenter, randomized controlled trial; BIS-guided protocol (target 40-60) vs routine care; propofol infusion received by 43% of patients
- **Statistical Findings**: Fisher's exact test, P=0.03, ARR 0.14%, 95% CI 1-4%, NNTB 697
- **Findings/Limitations**:
  - Significant reduction in AAGA incidence.
  - BIS values not compared given constant monitoring in both routine care and BIS group.
  - Includes 37 patients' reports of memories related to AAGA.
  - Long-term psychological effects post-AAGA not assessed.

**2. B-Unaware Trial (2008)**
- **Number of Patients**: 1,941
- **Target Population**: High risk for AAGA
- **Incidence of AAGA**: 0.21% in both BIS and MAC groups
- **Study Design**: Single-center RCT; BIS-guided protocol (target 40-60) vs. MAC protocol (target 0.7-1.3)
- **Statistical Findings**: No difference in AAGA incidence; ARR -0.57%, 95% CI -0.56% to 1.7%
- **Findings/Limitations**:
  - Study failed to show statistical difference in AAGA incidence.
  - Satisfaction with care higher in patients with confirmed awareness compared to those without (P<0.001).

**3. BAG-RECALL Trial (2011)**
- **Number of Patients**: 5,713
- **Target Population**: High risk for AAGA
- **Incidence of AAGA**: 0.28% in BIS group vs. 0.07% in MAC group
- **Study Design**: Multicenter, international, randomized controlled trial; BIS-guided protocol (target 40-60) vs. MAC protocol
- **Statistical Findings**: No difference in AAGA incidence; ARR -0.49%, 95% CI 0-0.2%, NNTB 4673
- **Findings/Limitations**:
  - No significant difference in AAGA incidence.
  - Long-term psychological effects post-AAGA not assessed.

**4. MACS Trial (2012)**
- **Number of Patients**: 18,836
- **Target Population**: All surgical patients with goal reached
- **Incidence of AAGA**: Not specifically reported between groups
- **Study Design**: Multicenter, international, randomized controlled trial; BIS-guided protocol (target 40-60)
- **Statistical Findings**: No difference in AAGA incidence
- **Findings/Limitations**:
  - Study terminated after prespecified interim analysis determined no significant difference between groups.

**5. NAPS (2014)**
- **Number of Patients**: 300
- **Target Population**: Individuals who experienced AAGA
- **Incidence of AAGA**: ~1:19,600 in all anaesthetics
- **Study Design**: Large anonymous survey conducted over one year in the UK and Ireland, estimating AAGA incidence in cardiothoracic surgery and monitored anaesthetic care.
- **Statistical Findings**: The incidence of certain/probable and possible AAGA cases was around 1:119,600.
- **Findings/Limitations**:
  - Largest survey on AAGA based on UK and Ireland data.
  - 41% reported some degree of severe long-term sequelae.
  - Early reassurance and active early support may mitigate the impact of AAGA.

# Prevention Strategies

- Regular checking of equipment (e.g., vaporizers, infusion pumps) and drug administration.
- Minimise the use of NMBA; use neuromuscular monitoring when NMBAs are necessary.
- Depth of anaesthesia (DoA) monitoring is not routinely recommended but may be useful for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and when using paralytics.
- Ensure clear and uniform labelling of syringes, use standard syringe sizes, and conduct verbal double-checks before drug administration.

## Management of Anaesthesia Awareness

1. **Meeting**: Involve an independent witness and document the event carefully.
2. **Analysis**: Confirm details of the awareness event and identify the cause.
3. **Support**: Provide follow-up consultations to check for adverse psychological consequences at 24 hours and 2 weeks postoperatively. Consider referral for PTSD treatment if needed.
4. **Adverse Event Reporting**: Report the incident as a critical event.

# Consequences of Anaesthesia Awareness

- Nightmares.
- Flashbacks.
- Anxiety.
- Sleep disturbances.
- Fear of future anaesthesia.
- Avoidance of medical care.
