# Death and Brainstem Death

## Introduction
- Patient needs to fulfill certain preconditions and have absent brainstem reflexes.

### Death: Cardiovascular, Respiratory, and Neurologic Mechanisms

#### Cardiovascular System Insult

1. **Distributive Problems**
	- **Causes**: Sepsis, anaphylaxis, pancreatitis, adrenal insufficiency, vasodilatory drugs.
	- **Mechanism**: Inappropriate systemic vasodilation leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR).

2. **Obstructive Problems**
	- **Causes**: Cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, massive pulmonary embolism.
	- **Mechanism**: Adjacent pressure affecting heart filling.

3. **Hypovolemic Problems**
	- **Causes**: Hemorrhage, dehydration, burns.
	- **Mechanism**: Low cardiac preload causing low stroke volume (SV).

4. **Cardiac Valve Dysfunction**
	- **Causes**: Myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, heart block.
	- **Mechanism**: Decreased contractility, preload.

5. **Peripheral Metabolic Disturbances**
	- **Causes**: Hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, toxins (e.g., cocaine, beta-blockers).
	- **Mechanism**: Disturbed electrical activity, severe thyroid derangement.

#### Bradycardia (Low Heart Rate)
- **Causes**: Injury to cervical or upper thoracic spinal cord.
- **Mechanism**: Unopposed parasympathetic stimulation affecting heart rate and disrupting spinal cord input.

#### Decreased Cardiac Output
- **Causes**: Low blood pressure (BP = CO x SVR).
- **Mechanism**: Insufficient blood flow to organs, leading to hypoxia.

#### Circulatory Collapse/Shock
- **Causes**: Persistent hypotension with inadequate tissue perfusion.
- **Mechanism**: Low oxygen content in blood, contributing to respiratory and metabolic dysfunction.

#### Respiratory System Insult

1. **Hypoxemia (Type I Respiratory Failure)**
	- **Causes**: Low dissolved oxygen in blood (PaO2).
	- **Mechanism**: Inadequate oxygenation of blood.

2. **Hypercapnia/Hypercarbia (Type II Respiratory Failure)**
	- **Causes**: Elevated dissolved CO2 in blood (PaCO2).
	- **Mechanism**: Inability to remove CO2, leading to respiratory arrest.

3. **Respiratory Arrest**
	- **Causes**: Severe hypoventilation, inability to protect airway.
	- **Mechanism**: Complete cessation of breathing.

4. **Hypoxia**
	- **Mechanism**: Metabolic disturbances leading to acidosis. Can trigger cardiac arrest if unresolved.

#### Neurologic System Insult

1. **Decreased Level of Consciousness**
	- **Causes**: Metabolic disturbances, increased intracranial pressure, brainstem lesion (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage).
	- **Mechanism**: Edema, inflammation, neuronal dysfunction, severe hypoventilation.

2. **Central Nervous System Infection**
	- **Mechanism**: Severe infection leading to brain inflammation and dysfunction.

#### Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)/Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)
- **Mechanism**: Severe cardiac rhythm disturbances leading to death if untreated.

#### Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA)
- **Mechanism**: Electromechanical dissociation where the heart has electrical activity but no effective cardiac output.

#### Asystole
- **Mechanism**: Complete cessation of electrical activity and cardiac output.

#### Death
- **Mechanism**: Irreversible cessation of cardiac, respiratory, and brain function.

### Brain Death: Pathogenesis, Assessment, and Clinical Findings

#### Causes of Brain Death

1. **Brain Tumor**
	- **Mechanism**: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP), compression of brainstem.

2. **Herniation**
	- **Mechanism**: Compression of brainstem, severe neuronal damage.

3. **Severe Head Trauma**
	- **Mechanism**: Severe connections and neuronal damage.

4. **Cardiac Arrest/MI**
	- **Mechanism**: Abrupt cessation of blood and/or oxygen supply to the brain.

5. **Stroke**
	- **Mechanism**: Vascular disruption leading to brain damage.

6. **Infection**
	- **Mechanism**: Brain edema from severe inflammation.

7. **Metabolic/Toxic**
	- **Mechanism**: Diffuse hemispheric damage.

#### Brain Death Criteria

- **Harvard Criteria**
	- No clinical findings for 24 hours.
	- No spontaneous respirations on ventilator.
	- EEG shows cessation of brain function for 30 minutes.

#### Brain Death Confirmation

1. **Known Cause**
2. **Absence of Confounding Factors**
	- Hypothermia
	- Drugs (CNS depressants, anti-arrhythmics, TCAs)
	- Metabolic/Electrolyte Disturbances

3. **No Response to Apnea Testing**
	- PaCO2 > 60 mmHg.

4. **Absence of Brainstem Reflexes**
	- CN 2: Absent pupillary reflex.
	- CN 3, 4, 6: Absent spontaneous eye movements.
	- CN 3, 4, 6, 8: Absent oculovestibular reflex.
	- CN 5, 7: Absent corneal reflex.
	- CN 9, 10: Absent gag reflex, cough.

5. **Unreceptivity/Unawareness**
	- No response to painful stimuli (e.g., pinching earlobe, sternal rub).

#### Brainstem Death Tests

1. **Pupillary Response**
	- **CN**: II, III
	- **Test**: Light stimulus, absence of pupillary constriction.

2. **Corneal Reflex**
	- **CN**: V, VII
	- **Test**: Swab stimulus, no blinking.

3. **Oculo-Vestibular Reflex**
	- **CN**: VIII, III, IV, VI
	- **Test**: Ice-cold saline in ear, no eye movement.

4. **Response to Painful Stimulus**
	- **CN**: V, VII
	- **Test**: Painful stimuli, no motor response.

5. **Gag Reflex**
	- **CN**: IX, X
	- **Test**: Stimulation of pharynx, no gag response.

6. **Cough Reflex**
	- **CN**: X
	- **Test**: Bronchial catheter, no cough.

7. **Apnea Test**
	- **Procedure**: Increase FiO2, reduce ventilation, observe for respiratory activity, confirm PaCO2 rise > 0.5 kPa.

#### Relationship of Criteria for Diagnosis and Confirmation of Death

- **Cardiorespiratory Determination**
	- Irreversible loss of capacity to breathe.
- **Neurological Determination**
	- Irreversible loss of consciousness.
- **Somatic Determination**
	- Irreversible cessation of somatic functions.

## Definition of Death
- The medical definition of death is accepted as the irreversible absence of brain function. The loss of the integrative function of the entire brainstem means that all capacity for consciousness and involuntary physiological functioning are lost. This can be from a primary brain insult or secondary to irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory function.
- In South Africa, Chapter 8 of the National Health Act defines death as "brain death".
	- Specific standards for determination are not stipulated in law and this allows for the natural evolution of medical standards as treatments advance.
	- The regulations regarding organ transplantation stipulate that in the case of organ transplantation brain death must be determined by two doctors, one with more than 5 years of experience and neither of whom may be members of the transplant team.

## Pathophysiology of Brainstem Death

- Early, short-lived massive sympathetic outflow occurs during brainstem herniation, causing hypertension, tachycardia, myocardial dysfunction, impaired organ perfusion, and tissue ischaemia.
- Autonomic collapse results in a reduction in cardiac output, hypotension, and atropine-resistant bradycardia. Circulatory collapse follows, if left untreated.
- Deterioration in lung function is common due to neurogenic pulmonary oedema, acute lung injury, and pre-existing disease.
- Reduced circulating T3 and T4, with increased peripheral conversion of T4 to reverse T3, causes depletion of myocardial energy stores, myocardial dysfunction, and a global shift to anaerobic metabolism.
- Hyperglycaemia is due to reduced circulating insulin and insulin resistance.
- Reduced ADH secretion leads to neurogenic diabetes insipidus, with hypovolaemia and electrolyte disorders (hypernatraemia, hypermagnesaemia, hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia, hypocalcaemia).
- Release of tissue fibrinolytic agents and plasminogen activators from the necrotic brain causes coagulopathy.
- Temperature regulation is lost due to hypothalamic dysfunction, resulting in hypothermia.

### Causes
- Head injury, intracranial haemorrhage, cerebral tumors, and hypoxic brain injury.

### Preconditions that Need to Be Met
- Deeply comatose, apnoeic, and dependent on mechanical ventilation.
- Coma must be caused by a known and irreversible cause of brain injury.
	- Reversible causes for brainstem depression have been excluded: sed

atives, muscle relaxants, alcohol, hypothermia, and metabolic or endocrine disturbances.

- Absence of brainstem responses tests of brainstem reflexes should be performed only when the preconditions are fulfilled.
- The rectal temperature is > 35°C and systolic BP is >90mmHg.
- Should be made by two medical practitioners trained and experienced in the field. One must be a consultant, and the other could be a second consultant or a doctor who has been registered for a minimum of 5 years. Neither should be a member of the transplant team.
- The tests must be performed on two occasions, separated by an adequate time interval, to satisfy all concerned.
- The diagnosis should not normally be considered until at least 6 hours after the onset of an apnoeic coma or 24 hours after the restoration of circulation if the cause was a cardiac arrest. If therapeutic hypothermia was used, the tests should be performed at least 24 hours after the restoration of normothermia.
- Death is confirmed after the 2nd set of tests, but the time of death is recorded as the completion of the 1st set of brainstem death criteria.
- No additional tests are required in the UK, but other countries may require EEG, cerebral angiography, or brainstem evoked potentials.

### Tests to Be Performed

1. **Pupillary Reflex**
	- Pupils should be fixed although not necessarily dilated.

2. **Corneal Reflex**
	- No response to light touch with cotton wool. Avoid damaging the cornea.

3. **Gag Reflex**
	- Absent on stimulating the back of the pharynx.

4. **Cough Reflex**
	- No response to suctioning via endotracheal tube.

5. **Pain Response in Facial Distribution Absent (Supra-orbital Compression)**
	- Supra-orbital compression must not elicit any response in a facial distribution. Spinal and tendon reflexes may be present.

6. **Oculo-cephalic Reflex (Doll’s Eye Movement)**
	- A negative doll's eye reflex (eyes remain midline or move in same direction of head movement) indicates severe brainstem dysfunction.

7. **Oculo-vestibular Reflex (Cold Caloric Test)**
	- There is no eye movement in response to the injection of 50mL of ice-cold water into the external auditory meatus—direct access to the tympanic membrane should be verified using an auroscope. The eyes should be observed for at least 1 minute after each injection.

8. **Apnea Test (Done Last)**
	- Ventilate the patient fully on 100% oxygen for 10 minutes. Do an arterial blood gas to check the pCO2 is within the normal limit (4.0—5.3 kPa or 35—45 mmHg). Then disconnect the ventilator and place the patient on a T-piece with an O2 flow rate of 15L/min. One of three things may take place:
		1. The patient may show some respiratory effort. The patient is not brain dead, although he may become brain dead at a later time. Replace on the ventilator. Consider for donation after circulatory death if the decision is still to withdraw support and death is expected.
		2. After 10 minutes there may be no signs of spontaneous respiration. A blood gas is done to confirm a raised pCO2 of >6.6 kPa (50 mmHg). In this setting, the patient may be certified brain dead.
		3. The patient may desaturate or become haemodynamically unstable. Reconnect the ventilator but do a blood gas to see if the PCO2 is adequately raised. If it is and there was no spontaneous respiration then the patient may be certified brain dead. If not consider ancillary testing. At the end of the test, it is essential to reconnect the ventilator as breathing or not breathing through an ET tube unsupported by ventilation hastens cardiac arrest.
9. Some transplant centers request an atropine test. This is done by administering 2mg of atropine and noting that the heart rate does not change (< 10 beats / minute). This is not used by the majority of brain death determination guidelines.

### Ancillary Testing if Brainstem Testing Cannot Be Performed

1. **Cerebral Angiography** is the gold standard of ancillary testing.
	- A 4-vessel angiogram will demonstrate a complete lack of brain perfusion from both the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation.
	- Radionuclide imaging techniques with a lipid-soluble radio-isotope which easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (such as technetium-99) will demonstrate a complete lack of uptake by the brain. Such studies are the preferred ancillary test at Red Cross Children's Hospital.

2. **Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography**
	- Can demonstrate cerebral circulatory arrest.
	- Requires clinical expertise and is not always technically possible.

3. **Electroencephalography**
	- Most commonly used supplementary test for brain death.
	- (NB. Status epilepticus precludes the diagnosis of brain death.)
	- There are technical guidelines relating to its use in determining brain death; however, it cannot be used as an isolated test (unlike a cerebral angiogram) due to its limitations from electric interference.
	- Some authors argue that an isoelectric EEG does not preclude deep thalamic function.

### Confounding Situations When Declaring a Patient Brain Dead

1. **Potentially Reversible Circulatory, Metabolic and Endocrine Disturbances**
	- Major disturbances can accompany brain death. These may be the effect of brain death rather than the cause of the coma and it is therefore important to know the proximate cause. It may be detrimental to correct such abnormalities too rapidly and targeting absolute electrolyte concentrations can delay brainstem testing unnecessarily.
		- Electrolyte disturbances Na/K/Mg
			- Raised Na can accompany brain death.
		- Hyper/hypoglycaemia
		- Endocrine: A thyroid storm, myxoedematous state, or an Addisonian crisis may cause coma.

2. **Sedatives**
	- An accurate drug history is essential and any possibility of intoxication contributing to the patient's clinical condition precludes the diagnosis of brain death.
	- The length of time between the last dose and brain death testing is dependent on several factors including the total dose, duration of treatment, underlying renal and hepatic function, and the availability of drug level testing.
	- Drug antagonists such as naloxone and flumazenil can be used if suspected.
	- In the setting of preserved renal and hepatic function, a waiting period of more than 5 drug half-lives is accepted.

3. **Paediatrics**
	- Guidelines vary internationally about the assessment of brain death in children. Some countries advocate retesting after a period of 24 hours following the initial testing and specify that tests must be carried out by two consultants.
	- It is important that testing be approached in an unhurried manner and it may be prudent to measure drug levels given the altered pharmacokinetics in children.
	- Adult criteria for brain death are valid in children older than 2 months. Under this age, the clinical validity of brainstem testing is not clear and ancillary testing is recommended.

4. **Spinal Reflexes**
	- Can be preserved in brain-dead patients.
	- Important to be clear about this with the family as their presence can be misleading.
	- The most dramatic presentation of a reflex arc through the spinal cord is the Lazarus reflex where the arms seem to rise-up and fall back across the body.
	- Ancillary testing (or repeated brainstem testing) may be warranted to reconfirm the diagnosis of brain death in such a situation.

5. **Persistent Vegetative State**
	- Brain death must not be confused with persistent vegetative state: loss of brainstem function is not complete and although the reticular system is affected such that there is complete loss of consciousness some autonomic functions remain, namely breathing, a stable circulation, and a simulated sleep and waking cycle.
