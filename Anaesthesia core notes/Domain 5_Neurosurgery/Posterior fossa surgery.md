# Posterior-Fossa Surgery

## Background

The posterior fossa, or infratentorial fossa, is a compact and rigid compartment with poor compliance. Any small increase in volume (e.g., tumour, haematoma) can significantly elevate compartmental pressure, leading to life-threatening brainstem compression. Tumours are the most common pathology in the posterior fossa, accounting for more than 60% of all brain tumours in children.

### Anatomy

The posterior fossa is the deepest cranial fossa, surrounded by the dorsum sellae and basilar portion of the occipital bone (clivus) anteriorly, the petrosal and mastoid components of the temporal bone laterally, the dural layer (tentorium cerebelli) superiorly, and the occipital bone posteriorly and inferiorly. The largest opening, the foramen magnum, is found in the occipital bone. The posterior fossa houses critical structures such as the brainstem, cerebellum, and lower cranial nerves (IV to XII), along with the sigmoid, transverse, and occipital sinuses. A narrow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathway through the cerebral aqueduct can become obstructed, leading to hydrocephalus and a significant increase in intracranial pressure (ICP).

### Pathology Requiring Surgery

Conditions requiring surgical intervention include:

- Congenital lesions (e.g., Arnold-Chiari malformation)
- Tumours (e.g., gliomas, medulloblastomas, acoustic neuromas)
- Vascular lesions

## Posterior Fossa Lesions

| **Tumour**              | **Notes**                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gliomas                 | Cerebellar astrocytomas, ependymomas, particularly arising from the 4th ventricle           |
| Medulloblastoma         | Often arising from the vermis of the cerebellum, usually in children                        |
| Acoustic neuroma        | Arising from the 8th nerve in the cerebellopontine angle, usually benign                    |
| Haemangioblastoma       | Common in young adults                                                                      |
| Meningiomas             | Less common in the posterior fossa                                                          |
| Metastatic tumours      | Diverse primary sources                                                                     |
| Abscesses and haematoma | Infectious or traumatic origins                                                             |
| Vascular lesions        | Aneurysms of the superior cerebellar, posterior inferior cerebellar, and vertebral arteries |
| Developmental lesions   | Arnold-Chiari malformation                                                                  |

## Considerations

- **Indication for procedure & status/complications of neurological disease (↑ ICP)**
- **Patient positioning & potential complications** (lateral, prone, sitting)
- **Anesthetic modifications for neuromonitoring:** Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), no paralysis
- **Facilitation of brain relaxation:** TIVA, SjvO2 for titration, mannitol, hyperventilation

### Preoperative Review
1. **Cerebellar and cranial nerve dysfunction**
   - Loss of gag reflex = aspiration pneumonitis
   - Bulbar dysfunction = postoperative ventilation or tracheostomy
2. **Elevated ICP**
   - Monitor level of consciousness (LOC) and respiratory pattern
3. **Hydration status and electrolytes**
   - Multifactorial dehydration: reduced oral intake, vomiting, contrast agents for scans, diabetes insipidus, diuretics
4. **Intraoperative positioning**
   - Patent foramen ovale (PFO) = risk of paradoxical emboli if sitting (screen with bubble contrast echo)
   - Prone positioning can be difficult in obese patients

### Conduct of Anaesthesia for Transsphenoidal Approach
- **Endocrinopathies considerations:** Commonly affected hormones include GH, prolactin, ACTH, or TSH
- **Monitors:**
  - Arterial line for hemodynamic stability monitoring
  - Lumbar drain: Exclude raised ICP pre-insertion. Preoperative insertion may require small volumes of air or saline to encourage downward displacement of the tumour into the surgical field. Leave in place postoperatively to manage any CSF leak.
- **Airway:**
  - Single-lumen reinforced (SFR) or armoured endotracheal tube (ETT)
- **Ventilation:**
  - Maintain PCO2 at 5.3-5.9 kPa to encourage downward displacement of the tumour
- **Position:**
  - Head up (Max 40 degrees) to minimize risk of air embolism and optimize venous drainage
- **Analgesia:**
  - Two episodes of intense stimulation (nasal septal fracture and breaching sphenoid bone): remifentanil
- **Postoperative Care:**
  - High care placement, monitor for airway issues (nasal packs in situ, non-invasive ventilation not an option), neurological assessment (eye movements, facial sensation, visual field defects, visual acuity), and endocrine monitoring (diabetes insipidus may develop within the first 24 hours, usually resolves within a week).

## Sitting Position Complications
- **Nerve damage:** From stretch, compression, or compromised perfusion. Support arms in padded gutters to avoid brachial plexus and shoulder traction injuries.
- **C-spine injury +/- Quadriplegia**
- **Skin pressure injuries**
- **Ocular injury:** Decreased intraocular pressure (IOP) and ICP
- **Airway compromise:** Poor access to the airway. Use ETT and check with flexion for movement.
- **Venous Air Embolism (VAE)**
- **Cardiovascular instability:** Venous pooling, decreased preload, stroke volume (SV), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Hip flexion to 100 degrees, leg elevation, bending knees, and compression stockings can help reduce venous pooling.
- **Pneumocephalus**
- **Macroglossia:** Avoid excessive head flexion.

### Contraindications for Sitting Position

| **Absolute Contraindications** | **Relative Contraindications** |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Ventriculo-atrial shunt        | Patent foramen ovale           |
| Right-to-left heart shunt      | Uncontrolled hypertension      |
| Extremes of age                |                                |
| Severe autonomic neuropathy    |                                |

### Acute CVS Collapse in Sitting Position: Differential and Management
- **Venous Air Embolism (VAE):** Cover field with saline-soaked swabs, lower the field to below heart level if possible, administer oxygen, stop N2O, support CVS with fluids and/or inotropes, chest compressions if necessary, use CVP to aspirate air from the right atrium if possible, and perform the Durant manoeuvre (partial left lateral position).
- **Parasympathetic-mediated (PNS) events:** From trigeminal cardiac reflex (TCR) or ICP-mediated vagus nerve stimulation: Stop manipulation and consider anticholinergic.
- **Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST):** Administer intralipid.

### Monitoring During Posterior Fossa Surgery

#### Venous Air Embolism (VAE) Monitoring

| **Monitor**                        | **Associated Clinical Signs** |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Transoesophageal echocardiography  | Absent                        |
| Praecordial Doppler                | Absent                        |
| Pulmonary artery pressure          | Minor changes (heart rate, MAP) |
| End-tidal carbon dioxide           | Minor changes (heart rate, MAP) |
| Right atrial pressure              | Significant increase          |
| Electrocardiography                | Cardiovascular collapse       |
| Oesophageal stethoscope            | Cardiovascular collapse       |

#### Neuromonitoring
- **EEG:** Detects cerebral hypoperfusion and cortical ischaemia.
- **SSEP:** Monitors spinal cord ischaemia, particularly in the sitting position.
- **Brainstem auditory-evoked potentials:** Monitor the function of the VIII cranial nerve.
- **Continuous EMG:** Monitors the VII cranial nerve during cerebellopontine angle surgery.
- **Anesthetic Technique Modifications:** Maintain consistent and modest levels of inhalational or intravenous anesthetic agents, avoid neuromuscular blocking agents, and use TIVA during motor-evoked potential monitoring.

## Complications
- Hemorrhage
- Venous air embolism (VAE)
- Hemodynamic instability from brainstem manipulation
- Limited patient access (foresight required in planning airway, access, monitoring)
- Pneumocephalus

### Pneumocephalus
- **Presentation:** Worsened with nitrous oxide, postoperative confusion, agitation, headache, neurological deficit, delayed recovery. Confirm via CT.
- **Treatment:** High-flow oxygen, bed rest, 30-degree head-up position (Fowler's), analgesia, antipyretics, avoid Valsalva manoeuvres, burr hole and aspiration if severe.

## Goals
- Maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)
- Avoidance of hemodynamic instability
- Facilitation of neuromonitoring
- Optimal brain relaxation for surgical exposure
- Rapid and smooth emergence from anesthesia
- Stable hemodynamics on emergence
- Vigilance and monitoring for VAE if high-risk position
- Use of remifentanil in patients with elevated ICP to reduce stress response to intubation.
# Arnold Chiari Malformation
## Background

Arnold Chiari Malformation encompasses a group of disorders characterized by anatomical anomalies of the cerebellum, brainstem, and craniocervical junction. These anomalies result in the downward displacement of the cerebellum, either alone or with the lower medulla, into the spinal canal. There are four major types (I-IV).

## Considerations
- Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and hydrocephalus
- C1-2 instability, with potential impingement of the brainstem by the dens

### Association with Meningomyelocele
- Hypovolemia due to fluid and blood loss from the defect
- Risk of infection and heat loss
- In adults, risks associated with neuraxial anesthesia include direct injury and herniation

### Increased Risk of Latex Allergy

### Increased Perioperative Risk
- **Brainstem dysfunction:** May present as stridor, apnea, and aspiration
- **Autonomic instability:** Can manifest as arrhythmias, bradycardia, and labile blood pressure
- **Seizures**

## Goals
- Avoid increased ICP, maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)
- Prevent brainstem herniation
- Ensure a latex-free environment
- Aim for rapid emergence to facilitate postoperative neurological examination

# Pituitary Mass Effects

## Overview

Pituitary tumors are almost always benign adenomas. Approximately 1 in 6 individuals have pituitary adenomas, with most being asymptomatic and found incidentally. Symptomatic adenomas requiring treatment are rare, affecting about 1 in 1000 individuals. Tumors can be classified as secreting or non-secreting, with 70% being secreting and most commonly producing prolactin, growth hormone, or ACTH.

## Tumor Sizes and Effects

### Microadenoma (<10mm on MRI)
- **Size:** Small, unlikely to cause mass effects
- **Symptoms:** Typically asymptomatic

### Macroadenoma (>10mm on MRI)
- **Size:** Larger, may press on surrounding structures, causing mass effects
- **Symptoms:** Headaches, nausea, vomiting, hypothalamic dysfunction, bitemporal hemianopsia, hydrocephalus, diplopia, post-nasal drip, meningitis

### Giant Adenoma (>40mm on MRI)

## Loss of Pituitary Hormones
- **Anterior hormones lost typically in the following order:** GH, LH, FSH, TSH, ACTH, PRL
- **Mnemonic:** "Go Look For The Adenoma Please"

## Effects and Symptoms

### Superior Tumor Growth
- **Extension into hypothalamus**
	- Damage to hypothalamic cells, leading to hypothalamic dysfunction
- **Stretching of the meninges**
	- Activation of mechanoreceptors, causing headaches, nausea, and vomiting
- **Impingement of the optic chiasma**
	- Resulting in bitemporal hemianopsia
- **Occlusion of ventricles**
	- Leading to increased ICP and hydrocephalus

### Lateral Tumor Growth
- **Impingement of cranial nerves III, IV, V (V1/V2), and VI**
	- Resulting in diplopia

### Inferior Tumor Growth
- **Erosion into sphenoid sinus**
	- Causes CSF leak into throat, leading to post-nasal drip
- **Communication between sinus and brain**
	- Increases risk of bacterial migration from sinus flora, potentially causing meningitis

## Specific Conditions
- **Hyperprolactinemia:** Due to obstruction of dopamine
- **Diabetes Insipidus:** Due to obstruction of ADH
