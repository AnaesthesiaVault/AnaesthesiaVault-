## Pathogenesis

### Small Artery Occlusion

- **Description**: Acute injury (<20mm diameter) of basal or brainstem penetrating arteries.
- **Result**: Decreased cerebral blood flow, significant decrease in oxygen at ischemic core.

### Large Artery Atherosclerosis

- **Description**: Cholesterol plaque decreases diameter of intraor extracranial vessel.
- **Result**: Decreased cerebral blood flow, significant decrease in oxygen at ischemic core.

### Cardiac Embolism

- **Description**: Blood clot in heart breaks free, travels to brain.
- **Result**: Decreased cerebral blood flow, significant decrease in oxygen at ischemic core.

### Other Causes

- **Examples**: Volume loss, severe infection.
- **Result**: Decreased cerebral blood flow, significant decrease in oxygen at ischemic core.

### Unknown Causes

- **Examples**: 2 or more mechanisms.
- **Result**: Modest decrease in oxygen at penumbra, spreading depolarization from core.

### Pathophysiology

1. **Cerebral Blood Flow Decrease**:
	- **Ischemic Core**: Significant O2 decrease → anaerobic metabolism → decreased ATP production.
	- **Penumbra**: Modest O2 decrease.
2. **Cellular Changes**:
	- **Ischemic Core**:
		- Metabolic demands > ATP supply.
		- Dysfunction of Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase pump → Na⁺ influx → H₂O influx → cerebral edema.
		- Cell death, microglia activation, cytokine release, astrocyte activation, inflammation.
	- **Penumbra**:
		- Depolarization, glutamate release, increased extracellular glutamate.
		- Biochemical pathways activation, glutamate receptor activation, Ca²⁺ influx.
		- Neuronal cell death, increased volume of infarcted brain tissue.
## Non-Neural Complications
### Dysphagia

- **Cause**: Brainstem lesion, primary motor cortex lesion affecting tongue/pharyngeal musculature, cranial nerve lesion.
- **Effects**: Difficulty coordinating food bolus, impaired gag reflex, increased aspiration risk.

### Urinary Incontinence

- **Types**:
	- **Overflow Incontinence**: Bladder muscle failure, catheter use, increased UTI risk.
	- **Urge Incontinence**: Uninhibited bladder contraction.

### Immobility

- **Effects**:
	- Decreased muscle motion and venous blood flow.
	- Increased DVT risk, possible pulmonary embolism.
	- Increased bone resorption, risk of falls/fractures.
	- Pressure ulcers due to skin pressure and obstructed blood flow.

### Obscured Vision

- **Cause**: Occipital infarct.
- **Effects**: Vision loss.
# Haemorrhagic Stroke
## Pathogenesis
#### Primary Intracerebral Hemorrhage (~75%)

- **Causes**: Amyloid Angiopathy, Hypertension, Unknown.
- **Mechanism**: Rupture of blood vessel(s), hematoma formation.

#### Secondary Intracerebral Hemorrhage (~25%)

- **Causes**: Aneurysm, Drugs (e.g., cocaine, anticoagulants), Vascular Malformations.
- **Mechanism**: Rupture of blood vessel(s), hematoma formation.

#### Pathophysiology

- **Blood Components Release**:
	- Toxic plasma components, red blood cell lysis, cytotoxic hemoglobin release.
	- Fenton-type free radical generation, oxidative damage.
	- Hypoxic brain tissue necrosis.
- **Metabolic Changes**:
	- Decreased oxidative phosphorylation, increased anaerobic glucose metabolism.
	- Increased lactate production, lactic acidosis.
	- Neuronal dysfunction, impaired cellular metabolism, neuronal death.
	- Microglial activation, endothelial cell apoptosis, blood-brain barrier permeability.
# Perioperative Stroke

## Background

**Definition**: Brain infarct (ischemic or hemorrhagic) occurring during surgery or < 30 days post-op.

**Types**:
- **Overt**: Acute infarct, classic signs/symptoms, lasting > 24 hours, easily diagnosed.
- **Covert**: Diagnosis made via brain imaging only, too subtle to be clinically diagnosed at the time.

**Incidence**: 0.1-1.9% after non-cardiac, non-neurosurgical procedures. Increased disability/mortality compared to non-surgical strokes.

**Etiology**:
- More common: Cardioembolic
- Less common: Hypotension leading to hypoperfusion

**Timing**: Peak on postoperative days 1-2. May contribute to postoperative neurocognitive decline.

### Recommendations Regarding Timing of Elective Surgery After Stroke

- Elective surgery should be delayed from 1 to 3 months post-stroke to prevent secondary cerebrovascular events.
  - Patients with acute/recent stroke have impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation and chemoregulation for months, making them dependent on systemic pressure and passive perfusion.
  - This dependence increases the risk for cerebral hypoperfusion, particularly during general anesthesia and the physiologic disturbances of surgery (e.g., hemorrhage, anemia, hypotension).

**Recommendations**:
1. Discuss surgical timing with a neurologist and consider delaying elective surgery in patients with recent stroke until etiology is investigated and autoregulatory disturbances have passed (likely at one month) (Opinion-based evidence, Category A).
2. Observational studies do not show a clear relationship between timing of past stroke and incidence of postoperative stroke (Category B, Level 2).
## Criteria for Stent Retriever Therapy

Stent retriever therapy is recommended for patients meeting the following criteria:

- Prestroke mRS score 0 to 1.
- AIS receiving rtPA within 4.5 hours of onset.
- Causative occlusion of the internal carotid artery or proximal MCA.
- Age 18 years or older.
- NIHSS score of 6 or higher.
- ASPECTS of 6 and higher.
- Treatment initiation within 6 hours of symptom onset.

## Considerations for High-Risk Patients

- Consider EEG/Cerebral oximetry monitoring.
- Both regional and general anesthesia are acceptable.
- Maintain normotension; avoid prolonged hypotension.
- Signs/symptoms of covert stroke are subtle:
  - Mental status changes only, no other deficits, diagnosis via CT/imaging only.

**Risk Factors**:
- Old age, history of prior stroke/TIA
- Hypertension, atrial fibrillation, valve disease, CAD, CHF, PFO
- CKD, diabetes, smoker/COPD
- Migraines
- Types of surgery: vascular, thoracic, transplant, endocrine, burn, ENT, hemicolectomy

### Management of Anticoagulation Post-Stroke for Elective Surgery

1. Medically manage atrial fibrillation and continue anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation for minor surgeries or those with low risk of high blood loss. Discontinue anticoagulation in high-risk bleeding surgeries, but resume as soon as bleeding risk is low (Opinion-based evidence, Category A).
2. No evidence suggests that continuation of aspirin reduces the risk of stroke after non-cardiac surgery (Category A, Level 3).

### Approach to Perioperative Bridging of Anticoagulation Management

#### Low-to-Moderate Bleeding Risk

**Preoperative**:
- Stop therapeutic-dose LMWH 20-24 hours before surgery.
- Omit evening dose with twice-daily regimen.
- Give 50% total dose with once-daily regimen.

**Postoperative**:
- Resume therapeutic-dose LMWH 24 hours after surgery when hemostasis is adequate.

#### High Bleeding Risk

**Preoperative**:
- Stop therapeutic-dose LMWH 20-24 hours before surgery.
- Omit evening dose with twice-daily regimen.
- Give 50% total dose with once-daily regimen.

**Postoperative**:
- Resume therapeutic-dose LMWH 48-72 hours after surgery when hemostasis is adequate.
- Administer low-dose LMWH or avoid postoperative bridging.
## National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)

The NIHSS is a systematic assessment tool providing a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. Initially designed for clinical trials, it is now widely used in clinical settings to evaluate stroke severity, determine treatment, and predict outcomes.

The NIHSS consists of 11 items assessing consciousness, language, neglect, visual fields, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss. Each item is scored from 0 to 4 (0 as normal), and the total score ranges from 0 to 42, with allowances for untestable items.

### NIHSS Score and Stroke Severity

| Score | Stroke Severity      |
|-------|----------------------|
| 0     | No Stroke Symptoms   |
| 1-4   | Minor Stroke         |
| 5-15  | Moderate Stroke      |
| 16-20 | Moderate to Severe Stroke |
| 21-42 | Severe Stroke        |

## Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)

The mRS measures the degree of disability or dependence after a stroke, ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death).

### mRS Scale

- **0**: No symptoms.
- **1**: No significant disability. Able to carry out usual activities despite some symptoms.
- **2**: Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance but unable to carry out all previous activities.
- **3**: Moderate disability. Requires some help but able to walk unassisted.
- **4**: Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance and unable to walk unassisted.
- **5**: Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
- **6**: Dead.

## Prevention

### Preoperative

- Identify high-risk patients and discuss risk/benefit profile.
- **For patients with a history of stroke**:
  - Delay elective surgery for 1-3 months post-stroke.
  - Proceed with urgent surgery.
- No interventions are known to decrease the risk of perioperative stroke.
- **Not recommended**:
  - Routine bridging of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.
  - Perioperative aspirin for stroke prevention.
  - Treating asymptomatic carotid artery disease.
  - Starting new beta-blocker therapy.
  - Stopping statins.
	- Statins withdrawal in acute stroke patients has an 8.7-fold rise in risk for early neurological deterioration.
	- Should be continued in the acute phase of ischemic stroke or initiated 2 weeks prior to surgery to decrease the risk of perioperative stroke.

### Intraoperative

- **Anesthetic Technique**: N₂O is acceptable; neuraxial anesthesia has lower CVA risk for knee and hip arthroplasty.
- **β-Blockers**: Increased CVA risk with metoprolol. Use esmolol (short duration of action) if needed.
- **Blood**: Avoid Hb < 9.
- **Glucose**: Monitor and maintain 3.3 - 6.7 mmol/L.
- **BP**: Avoid hypotension relative to baseline, especially in the beach chair position.

## Management

### Recommendations

1. Consider intravenous/intra-arterial rtPA or mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke (Category A).
2. Treat systolic BP > 180 mm Hg and diastolic BP > 105 mm Hg with antihypertensives like labetalol or nicardipine (Category A, Level 1).
3. Aspirin or other antiplatelets within 24 hours of intravenous fibrinolysis are not recommended (Category A).
4. Maintain oxygen saturation > 94% with supplemental oxygen (Category A).
5. Provide airway support and ventilator assistance for patients with decreased consciousness or bulbar dysfunction (Category A).
6. Perform baseline ECG and troponin assessment (Category A, Level 3).

- Requires high suspicion as mental status change may be the only sign of covert stroke.
- Consider using a scoring tool to detect covert stroke (e.g., mNIHSS).
- Perform routine investigations to rule out other causes:
  - Blood pressure, SpO2, ABG, blood glucose
  - CBC, electrolytes, creatinine

**If stroke is suspected**:
- Perform neurologic assessment.
- Immediate non-contrast CT or MRI.

**Once confirmed with imaging**:
- Consult stroke team/neurology service for further management.
- Consider endovascular thrombectomy.

### Postoperative CVA Management

1. Airway support for GCS < 8.
2. Supplementary O₂ to maintain SpO₂ > 94%.
3. Use a scale such as NIHSS to assess.
4. Urgent imaging.
5. Administer rtPA urgently if eligible for AIS (≤ 4.5 hours) and no contraindications (e.g., SAH, bleeding diathesis, Plt < 100, INR > 1.7, Glu < 2.7).
6. Endovascular intervention ± thrombectomy if eligible (≤ 6 hours).

## General Anaesthesia Vs Sedation and Local Anaesthesia

The optimal anaesthetic technique for managing endovascular treatment for ischemic stroke (IAS) remains unclear due to insufficient data. Stroke severity at baseline is a critical consideration as patients with more severe strokes often received GA due to higher NIHSS scores.

The choice between sedation and GA is influenced by institutional and neurointerventionalist preferences, with significant variability in sedation levels and drugs used for GA. Retrospective studies suggest that GA compared with sedation may result in worse clinical outcomes due to factors such as increased intervention time, instability during induction and emergence, and more significant blood pressure shifts, particularly hypotension, impacting cerebral perfusion. Additionally, GA does not allow for neurological assessments during and immediately after the procedure, and prolonged intubation is associated with higher pneumonia and/or sepsis risks.

### Comparison of General Vs Local Anaesthesia for Endovascular Therapy in AIS

| General Anaesthesia  | Local Anaesthesia       |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Pros:**            | **Pros:**               |
| - Immobility         | - Smoother haemodynamics|
| - Pain control       | - Neurological examination during procedure |
| - Airway protection  |                         |
| **Cons:**            | **Cons:**               |
| - Haemodynamic changes | - Lack of airway protection |
| - Additional workforce | - Potential for movement |
| - Potential time delay | - Uncontrolled pain and agitation |
|                      | - Prolonged procedure time |

### Recommendations from SNACC (2014)

- GA is recommended for patients already intubated for medical reasons, uncooperative patients, and those with posterior circulation strokes (Class IIa, Level B).
- LA with sedation and GA are feasible options for cooperative patients who can protect their airway (Class IIa, Level B).
- Anaesthesia should be initiated as quickly as possible to prevent delay.
- Preparation should include the ability to rapidly convert LA sedation cases to GA if necessary (Class IIa, Level C).
- Anaesthetic technique and pharmacological agents should be individualized based on clinical characteristics of each patient.
