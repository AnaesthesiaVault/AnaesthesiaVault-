## Consent for Transplant

- Without consent from the family there is no possibility of transplantation.
- There are very good evidence based guidelines for how to approach a family in order to maximize the chances of getting informed consent for transplantation.
	- The approach for consent must be made by the transplant co-ordinator and not the treating doctor.
	- Consent rates are much higher if these specialists make the approach to the family.
	- Discussions should be held away from the bedside in an appropriate setting.
	- The approach for consent must be decoupled from the discussion about the prognosis of the patient.
	- Families require time to come to terms with the situation and are more likely to refuse if approached about transplantation too early. Open ended questions are essential to be able to gauge the families' level of understanding.
	- Terms used to describe the clinical situation must be clear and direct.
	- Gentle words can confuse the situation with a family clinging to any optimistic words.
	- Early discussion with the transplant team in end-of-life care is important. This does seem to conflict with the dead donor rule, however there is no involvement at this stage in patient management.
	- In cases of donation after circulatory death all consent discussions have to take place prior to death certification.
	- The transplant coordinator is experienced in these situations and offers end-of-life care and counselling regardless of the decision to donate.
### Additional Consent
- Following brain death certification and family consent, permission is also obtained from the medical superintendent of the institution where the donor operation takes place.
- In all cases of unnatural death consent is obtained from the state pathologist.
- The procuring surgical team includes their operative findings into the post mortem request form.
### Requirements for Donations of Human Bodies and Tissue of Deceased Persons, according to the Human Tissue Act
1. Competent persons (> 16y) may make a verbal or written will to donate their body or organs, in the presence of 2 competent witnesses (>14y)
2. The will must nominate the donee institution or person and specify how the body or tissue should be used
3. If deceased, in the absence of a donation (will) or the deceased prohibiting such while alive, the following relatives may consent to donation, in order of preference: _spouse, partner*, major child, parent, guardian, major brother, major sister_.
4. If none of the above people can be located, the Director-General of Health can give consent for donation
5. Except for a whole body donation, and eye tissue, organs must be harvested within 24h, after which the body may be claimed by the family.
_Partners take preference over all family members besides spouse and cannot be overruled by the others, but court can be approached._
## Transplantation in South Africa
- Extended criteria donors include
	1. HIV positive donorscan be transplanted into HIV positive recipients
	2. Treatable infections—recipient can be treated with antibiotics
	3. Older donors - organs can be assessed individually and allocated to older recipients
	4. Younger donors—allocated to younger recipients
	5. Malignancy—primary brain tumours have a low risk of metastatic spread
## Anaesthesia for Brain-death Donor

- For a brain dead donor a full anaesthetic is required with paralysis. It is important to keep all organs functioning as optimally as possible right up until the point of cross clamping and cold perfusion. A multi-organ donor of heart, liver and kidneys will take approximately 3 hours.
- Ongoing resuscitation is often required through the operation.
- Prior to clamping and insertion of perfusion cannulas a large dose of systemic heparin is given (30 000U) to help prevent clot formation within the organs.
- At the time of cross clamping ventilation and all other active management can be stopped.
- The cold perfusion of the organs occurs in situ before further dissection of the organs prior to removal.
### Summary of Management of Brainstem Dead Donor

[View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.](https://whimsical.com/management-of-brainstem-dead-donor-T25qrJe8ZjkxoK7ouQCiPy?ref=chatgpt)

### Pre-op
 - Check that brainstem death has been confirmed and that agreement to organ donation has been obtained from the relatives and the coroner.
 - Management changes from cerebral resuscitation to optimal organ perfusion and oxygenation
 - Ensure intravascular volume resuscitation using continuous CVP monitoring. Avoid fluid overload in potential lung donors where a CVP >6mmhg may increase the A–a O2 gradient and reduce the number of donor lungs that can be retrieved successfully.
 - If hypotensive: Vasopressin/Noradrenaline should be started as the 1st-line vasopressor. PAFC and TOE are often requested for potential heart donors with high inotrope requirements. they allow assessment of the cardiac structure and function and prevent intravascular overload
 - If desmopressin has been used to control diabetes insipidus, it should be changed to vasopressin (ADh)—restores vascular tone and arterial pressure without a direct myocardial effect
 - Correct hypernatraemia with 5% glucose (Na + <155mmol/L). Glucose 4%/NaCl 0.18% with KCl should be used to replace normal urinary water and electrolyte losses.
 - Clotting abnormalities should be corrected with clotting factors and platelets
 - Central venous access via the right internal jugular vein and left radial arterial access are preferred due to early ligation of the left innominate vein and right subclavian artery, respectively.
 - The use of hormone resuscitation, using t3 replacement, methylprednisolone, and vasopressin, varies among transplant centres. their use should be guided by the local retrieval team or in-house protocols. high-dose methylprednisolone increases the successful retrieval of lungs for transplantation.
#### Hormone Resuscitation During Organ Retrieval

| Hormone                                  | Bolus         | Infusion        | Action                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Liothyronine** (Tri-iodothyronine, T₃) | 4 micrograms  | 3 micrograms/hr | Reverses myocardial dysfunction and reduces inotrope requirements                                        |
| **Vasopressin (ADH)**                    | 1U            | 0.5–2U/hr       | Treats diabetes insipidus and restores vascular tone. Titrated to MAP >60 mmHg or SVR 800–1200 dyn·s/cm⁵ |
| **Insulin**                              | Sliding scale | Sliding scale   | Maintains blood sugar 6–9 mmol/L                                                                         |
| **Methylprednisolone**                   | 15 mg/kg      | ±               | Improves oxygenation and increases donor lung procurement by reducing cytokine-mediated cellular injury  |

### Intra Op
- Maintain core temperature >35°C.
- Frequent analysis of ABGs, electrolytes, hct, glucose, and clotting.
- Large-bore IV access (right upper limb) is mandatory for the replacement of fluid losses (up to 8L) with crystalloid, colloid, or red cells (keep hct >30%).
- The need for GA is controversial. Many use up to 1 MAC isoflurane or fentanyl (5–7 micrograms/kg) to control reflex pressor responses during surgery. this can also be achieved using labetalol or GtN.
- Non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents are administered to obtund reflex muscular contractions due to the preserved spinal reflexes and to improve surgical access.
- Large and frequent haemodynamic fluctuations occur due to compression of the IVC, manipulation of the adrenals, and blood/fluid. hypotension is treated with colloid titrated to the CVP, vasopressin infusion, and metaraminol (0.5mg increments).
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics are given as per local transplant protocol
- Full heparinization (300IU/kg) should be administered centrally prior to surgical cannulation of the major vessels.
- Epoprostenol (5–20ng/kg/min) may be needed for 10min via the PA if the lungs are to be harvested.
- PAFC/CVC withdrawn before ligation of the SVC
- Note the time of aortic cross-clamp as the beginning of organ ischaemic time
- At the end, discontinue mechanical ventilation/monitoring, and remove the ETT after lung inflation and trachea cross-clamp.
- The abdominal surgical team continues to operate in circulatory arrest
#### Target Parameters for Organ Retrieval

| Target Parameter                 | Value                                         |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **CVP**                          | 4–10 mmHg (<6 mmHg for potential lung donors) |
| **MAP**                          | 60–80 mmHg                                    |
| **PAOP**                         | 10–15 mmHg                                    |
| **Cardiac Index**                | >2.2–2.5 L/min/m²                             |
| **Hb**                           | 100 g/L (Hct 30%)                             |
| **SpO₂**                         | >95% (with lowest FiO₂ and PEEP)              |
| **V<sub>T</sub>** (Tidal Volume) | 6–8 mL/kg                                     |
| **PaCO₂**                        | 4.5–5.5 kPa (34–41 mmHg)                      |
| **Urine Output**                 | 1–3 mL/kg/hr                                  |
| **Peak Inspiratory Pressure**    | <30 cmH₂O                                     |

### Special Considerations
- Empathy and sensitivity in dealing with the donor’s family are paramount throughout the management of the potential organ donor.
- the quality of care afforded to the multiorgan donor could affect the outcome of >6 recipients.
- In the event of a cardiac arrest, CPR should be commenced, as procurement of the liver and kidneys can still proceed rapidly with cross-clamping of the aorta at the diaphragm and infusion of cold preservation solution into the distal aorta and portal vein

## Donation after Cardiac Arrest

- Consent for donation is given by the family prior to withdrawal of futile life supporting care.
- Upon withdrawal of care if the patient arrests within an hour of being extubated and the procurement operation takes place immediately following certification of the death then it is possible to donate kidneys, liver and lungs.
- The operation must take place immediately as the organs suffer irreparable damage if they are warm and ischaemic.
- The setting where withdrawal of care takes place will vary depending on the hospital. The transplant team is however scrubbed and waiting in the theatre for the body in order to cold perfuse the organs as rapidly as possible. Not all patients will arrest within the specified hour and in this case the theatre team stands down, the patient is transferred to a palliative care ward and the family informed that organ donation was not possible.
## Brain Dead Donor Management

## General Considerations of the Management of a Brain Dead Donor
- **Basic standard monitoring**
	- Fluid intake and output, hourly urine output
	- Pulse oximetry, temperature and ECG Arterial blood pressure
	- For donors requiring vasopressor support invasive arterial monitoring and a central line.
- **Laboratory investigations**
	- 4—6 hrly U/E, Blood glucose, ABG
	- 8—12 hrly FBC, Liver enzymes, INR
	- Work-up of the donor for infection and tissue typing is handled by the transplant co-ordinator
		- A minimum is HIV, syphilis, CMV, EBV, Hepatitis B, C, CXR, Sputum MC&S, Urine protein creatinine ratio, Blood group
- **Targets**
	- Heart rate: 60 -120 / min
	- Blood pressure: MAP > 65 mmHg
	- Urine output: 50—100 ml / hour
- **Hypotension**
	- Donors are frequently under resuscitated and adequate volume expansion may be necessary.
	- Typically a crystalloid (not normal saline due to concerns of hypernatraemia affecting liver transplant outcomes).
	- An Hb of between 7—10 is adequate in a stable donor.
	- Too much fluid can adversely affect the potential for a lung transplant.
	- Loss of vasomotor control often occurs (following an initial hypertensive episode related to raised intracranial pressure) and vasopressors can be required.
	- Adrenaline is not favoured due to its adverse effects on cardiac transplant outcomes.
	- The renal team prefer dopamine/dobutamine as an initial agent and this is often sufficient. International guidelines suggest vasopressin or phenylephrine as first line agents because of their pure vasomotor activity.
	- Dynamic indicators of volume status such as pulse pressure variation and response to a passive leg raise are the best way to assess volume status.
- **Respiratory**
	- A tidal volume of 6—8 ml /kg and a PEEP of 5 cm water is recommended targeting a saturation of > 95%.
	- Routine suctioning, head up 30° and cuff pressure < 25 mmHg.
	- Avoid fluid overload.
- **Diabetes Insipidus**
	- Features include a high urine output (> 4 ml /kg/hr), and increasing sodium (>145 mmol/L) and decreasing urine osmolarity / specific gravity.
	- Formal testing is not required and can be suspected clinically. An appropriate initial replacement fluid is 0.45% N/S switching to 5% Dextrose water if sodium control is an issue.
	- DDAVP can be used if the urine output is greater than 300 ml / hr for 3 hours.
- **Hypothermia**
	- The body loses thermoregulation and active rewarming may be required.
- **Steroids**
	- Steroids are given routinely.
	- Methylprednisolone 1 g / 24 hrs. (eg Solucortef 100 mg 2 hrly). T3 is no longer available.
- **DIC**
	- Occurs in up to a third of patients and may need to be corrected if there is active bleeding.
# Immunology of Transplantation

## Introduction
- Transplants are either autografts (transplanting tissue within the recipient), isografts (transplanting tissue between genetically identical recipients), allografts (transplanting between genetically non-identical individuals but of the same species) and xenografts (transplanting tissue between different species).
	- Transplant immunology alludes to the innate and adaptive responses that occur after the graft has been placed.
## Host Response to Graft
- Tissue damage from mechanical trauma, ischaemia, hypothermia or hypoperfusion causes the release of proinflammatory mediators such as histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, prostaglandin E2 and leukotrienes B4 and D2.
- These trigger three systems:
	- the clotting cascade, forming fibrinopeptides
	- the kinin system, which produces bradykinin
	- the complement system, which is activated predominantly through the classical pathway (antigeneantibody complexes).
- The end result is an increase in vascular permeability, vasodilatation and attraction of phagocytes.
- Macrophages release the cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). In combination with activated endothelial cells, T lymphocytes are recruited to the site and mediate direct T-cell-mediated specific toxicity, antibodymediated responses and delayed hypersensitivity responses as well as non-specific cytotoxicity by natural killer cells mediated by T-helper cells.
## How Does the Host Immune Response Differ from the Normal Response to Pathogens
- The major difference in transplant immunology compared with the normal immune response is the mode by which T-cell activation occurs. In the interaction of the recipient immune system with the allograft this may occur in two ways.
	- Direct interaction: This involves direct binding of recipient T cells to donor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on transplanted tissues in the presence of co-stimulation. Activation of T cells after TCR-APC interaction only occurs after additional interaction by costimulatory molecules (i.e. between CD 28 on T cell and B27 on APC)
	- Indirect interaction: The processing of allograft antigen by the recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
- If the immune response to the presence of foreign tissue is unchecked it will lead to rejection of the graft. Different types of rejection episodes can be recognized.
### Hyperacute Rejection
- This occurs within hours or days. It is due to preformed cytotoxic antibodies to transplant antigens from previous transplantation, blood transfusion or pregnancy.
- This results in complement and endothelial cell activation with platelet aggregation and intravascular thrombosis.
- There is very little host leucocyte infiltration. Hyperacute rejection is now very rare with routine pretransplantation screening of graft recipients for anti-donor antibodies.
### Acute Rejection
- This occurs within weeks and is a cell-mediated response to the presence of the graft. It is treated by immunosuppressants.
- These drugs are in the form of induction therapy, long-term immunosuppression or rescue agents. Immunosuppressants can be classified as:
	- cytokine gene inhibitors: corticosteroids
	- nucleic acid inhibitors: azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil
	- IL-2 inhibitors: cyclosporin, tacrolimus, rapamycin
	- T-cell inhibitors: anti-lymphocyte globulin, monoclonal antibodies.
### Chronic Rejection
- This occurs months to years after transplantation.
- The aetiology can be due to either antigen-independent factors (donor factors, ischaemia-reperfusion, hypertension) or antigen-dependent factors (human leucocyte antigen [HLA] mismatch, sensitization).
- The response is proliferative, induced by cytokines and growth factors mediating smooth muscle proliferation and migration and is characterized by intimal proliferation and vascular occlusion. Other examples are the ‘vanishing bile duct syndrome’ in liver transplants.
- Management includes minimization of organ ischaemia, treatment of hypertension and cytomegalovirus, and antiplatelet agents.
## Phases of Immunotherapy
**1. Induction** (to suppress or delete lymphoctes around the time of transplantation) - High potency biological agents (monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies) used to reduce risk of acute rejection and delay maintenance therapy. Commonly initiated intra-op or post-transplant for up to 10d.
**2. Maintenance** - most commonly tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid and prednisolone. This ‘triple therapy’ regimen has been shown to have better graft survival and function as well as less rejection
**3. Management of acute rejection** 
## Side Effects of Immunosuppressive Therapies
**Steroids** suppress HPA axis and may need supplementation. Glucose intolerance, skeletal demineralization, thin skin, obesity.
**Calcineurin inhibitors** (reduces production of IL2)
	CyclosporineSE: hpt, renal injury, hepatotoxity & seizure threshold reduction. 
	TacrolimusSE: renal injury and neurotoxicity
	Both need levels monitoring and are metabolized by CYP 3A4.
**Cell cycle inhibitors:**
	Azothioprine-SE: myelosupression & hepatotoxicity
	Mycophenolate mofetilSE: GI (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea & constipation)
	SirolimusSE: myelosuppression & hyperlipidaemia
**Antibodies**:
	RATG-SE: myelosupression & fever
	Note: daclizumab & basiliximab are give prior to transplant only.
	Note: vasculopathy more prominent in patients on immunosuppressants.
# Non-Transplant Surgery for Previously Transplanted Patient
**Asepsis and infection avoidance:**
	Strict asepsis.
	Only use a catheter or CVP if strictly necessary.
	Neuraxial is not contraindicated but be aware of strict asepsis.
**Aspiration risk:**
	Aspiration can be devastatingpatients are at higher risk of Gourd.
**Coronary artery disease risk increased:**
	Check exercise tolerance and major cardiac risk actors.
**Evaluate transplant:**
	Graft function.
	Changes in immunosuppressive therapy.
	Hx of rejectionwhat treatment was required.
	Objective data (biopsy, cardiac cath, GI procedures).
**Blood products:**
	Anaemia is common.
	Aim for 11g/dl prior to surgery.
	Optimisation: Nutritional supplementation, adjustment of immunosuppression or erythropoietin. Discuss the last 2 with transplant teamhave serious risks.
	Risks of a blood transfusion = 
	Rejection secondary to leucocyte HLA sensitisation
	CMV infection
	Prevention = 
	Leucocyte depletion PRBC (FFPs and cryo are usually leucocyte deplete, platelets should be but may need to passed through a leucocyte filter)
**PK/PD:**
	Altered by transplant itself and immunosuppression SE.
	Consider using depth of anaesthesia monitoring.
**Organ function:**
	of the organ transplanted and of organs that may be affected by the immunosuppression.
**Anaesthetic drug considerations:**
	Benzos and neuromuscular blockers action prolonged by cyclosporine.
	Etomidate suppressed cortisol for 24 hours, this has not been found to be clinically relevant but risk benefit.
	Nitrous oxide (N2O) implicated in bone marrow suppression but definitive studies are lacking. Also increased PHT.
	Note there is no contraindication for sux (even in heart transplants)
