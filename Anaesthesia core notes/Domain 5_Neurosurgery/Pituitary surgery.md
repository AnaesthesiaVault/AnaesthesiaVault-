# Introduction
- 15% of all intracranial tumours
- A throat pack should be inserted following intubation
- Major haemorrhage may occur if there is disruption of the cavernous sinus/carotid arteries which lie lateral to the pituitary gland
## The Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis

- The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis is central to hormonal regulation.
- Specialized pituitary cells produce trophic hormones, stimulating endocrine glands throughout the body. These hormones inhibit the release of their respective trophic hormones via a negative feedback loop.
- In certain pituitary adenomas, specialized cells proliferate autonomously, leading to hormone overproduction and distinct endocrine syndromes.

## Types of Pituitary Tumors

- **Adenomas** are the most common benign tumors of the anterior pituitary. Classified by cell of origin and size at the time of discovery, they commonly present with neurological symptoms, hormone imbalance, or are discovered incidentally.
  
### Size-Based Classification

- **Macroadenoma**: >1 cm  
- **Microadenoma**: <1 cm  

### Hormone Secretion

- **Functioning Adenoma**: Secretes specific hormones, causing symptoms of hormonal excess. Typically presents as a microadenoma.
- **Nonfunctioning Adenoma**: Grows silently, usually presenting as a macroadenoma with compressive symptoms.
## Clinical Presentation

- **Neurological Symptoms**: Due to mass effect (e.g., headache, nausea/vomiting, visual changes, hydrocephalus, growth retardation, Parinaud syndrome (decreased pupillary light reflex, paralysis of upgaze, retraction-convergence nystagmus)
- **Incidental Findings**: Clinically silent, mostly macroadenomas.
- **Hormonal Abnormalities**: Over or underproduction of hormones:
  - **Lactotroph Adenomas** (most common, up to 30%): Hyperprolactinemia → hypogonadism in males and females.
  - **Nonfunctioning/Null-Cell Adenomas** (second most common, up to 25%): Can present with hormonal insufficiencies related to hypopituitarism.
  - **Corticotroph Adenomas** (10-15%): Increased ACTH and cortisol → classic Cushing’s disease (diagnosis: dexamethasone suppression test, hypophyseal venous sampling).
  - **Somatotroph Adenomas** (5-10%): Increased growth hormone → gigantism in children, acromegaly in adults.
  - **Gonadotroph Adenomas** (5%): Increased FSH and/or LH → irregular menses, low testosterone, low libido.
  - **Thyrotroph Adenomas** (extremely rare): Increased TSH and T4 → hyperthyroidism.
  - **Craniopharyngiomas**: Hormonal deficiencies (e.g., diabetes insipidus, lack of growth hormone in children).
- **Stalk Effect**: Hyperprolactinemia due to compression of the stalk, removing tonic inhibition of prolactin by dopamine.

## Workup

- **Imaging**:
  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium is the imaging modality of choice for sellar masses.
  - Computed tomography (CT) helps delineate bony structures of the skull base and facial skull.
- **Laboratory Workup**:
  - Evaluate hypothalamic-pituitary hormonal function via serum prolactin, insulin-like growth factor, plasma ACTH, cortisol, 24-hr urinary free cortisol, total or free thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicular stimulating hormone, and testosterone.
  - Include a basic metabolic panel (to identify electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities) and complete blood count.

## Management

- **Pharmacologic Treatment**:
  - Dopamine agonists (e.g., cabergoline, bromocriptine) for prolactinomas.
  - Somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide) for gigantism and acromegaly.
  - Propylthiouracil for hyperthyroidism.
- **Surgical Intervention**:
  - Transsphenoidal surgery is the primary treatment for most pituitary masses.
  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak may require local flap, abdominal, or fascia lata free flap placement.
- **Radiation Therapy**: Considered when surgery and/or medications have been exhausted.

## Anesthetic Considerations
### Goals
- Optimize perioperative endocrine function (stress dose steroids), consult endocrinology
- Avoid further ↑ in ICP (if hydrocephalus)
- Provide a still field for microscopic surgery
- Minimize long acting sedatives (crisp emergence for neurological evaluation)
- Controlled emergence (minimize bucking/coughing/vomiting to ↓ risk of bleeding and CSF leak)
- **Monitor for postoperative complications:**
Diabetes insipidus (~40%)
SIADH (usually delayed)
Adrenal insufficiency & CV collapse (steroid coverage)
Bleeding → ↑ ICP, brainstem compression, cranial nerve dysfunction
CSF leak (risk of meningitis)
Hypothalamic injury
Cerebal ischemia
Stroke

### Preoperative Evaluation and Management

- **Evaluation of Pituitary Function**:  
  - Assess pituitary function in patients with pituitary tumors before and after surgery.  
  - Hormonal deficiencies may require preoperative replacement (e.g., hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency).
  - **Untreated Hypothyroidism**:
	- Increased sensitivity to narcotics and barbiturates.
	- Prolonged emergence.
	- Risk of myxedema coma.
  - **Untreated Adrenal Insufficiency**:
	- Hemodynamic instability.
	- Hypotension.
	- Risk of shock.
- **Acromegaly and Cushing’s Disease**:
  - Increased risk of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and electrolyte abnormalities.
  - Additional preoperative workup (e.g., echocardiography, HbA1C) should be tailored accordingly.
- **Airway Evaluation**:
  - Essential due to potential airway management difficulties in patients with acromegaly and Cushing’s disease.
  - Anatomical distortion and comorbidities such as obstructive sleep apnea and obesity must be considered.

### Intraoperative Management

- **Monitoring**:
  - Standard ASA monitors.
  - Arterial catheter for close blood pressure monitoring (anticipate potential for sudden changes).
  - Precordial Doppler may be considered due to the small risk of venous air embolism from patient positioning.
  - **Acromegaly Considerations**:
	- Possible ulnar artery obstruction from compression at the wrist.
	- Radial artery catheter placement may be inappropriate; consider alternative arterial sites.
- **Patient Positioning**:
  - Slight head-up position.
  - Head secured in a Mayfield headholder.
  - Bed typically turned 90 degrees, with the right side away from the anesthesia team.
  - Prep and drape areas for abdominal fat graft or fascia lata free flap, if required.
- **Airway Management**:
  - Backup airway equipment such as video laryngoscopes and smaller endotracheal tubes (e.g., 6, 6.5) should be available.
  - Be prepared for unexpected hemodynamic changes (e.g., from intranasal vasoconstrictor administration, stimulation during endonasal approach).
- **Bleeding**:
  - Anticipate bleeding due to the proximity of major blood vessels around the pituitary.
  - Large bore peripheral IV access is recommended.
  - Central venous access is rarely necessary.
- **Urine Output and Fluid Balance**:
  - Recommended, especially for hormone-secreting tumors (risk of electrolyte imbalance) or large tumors (risk of diabetes insipidus).
- **Anesthetic Technique**:
  - Balanced technique using opioids and neuromuscular blockers to prevent movement and hemodynamic derangements.
  - Total IV anesthetics may be preferred to volatile anesthetics for smooth emergence and reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting.
- **Emergence from Anesthesia**:
  - Special considerations for the transsphenoidal approach:
	- Avoid positive pressure ventilation and coughing on emergence.
	- Enhanced nausea and vomiting prophylaxis.
	- Strict nasal precautions.
  - Consider remifentanil and dexmedetomidine infusions to achieve these goals.
- **Gastric Tube Management**:
  - Surgical team should perform suctioning of the stomach and hypopharynx before handing over airway management to the anesthesia team.
  - Avoid blind insertion of gastric tubes through the mouth to prevent accidental passage through the skull base defect.
- **Ventilator Management**:
  - Emphasize optimal management to preserve functional residual capacity, reduce hypoxia, and minimize supplemental oxygenation.
- **Obstructive Sleep Apnea**:
  - Consider nasopharyngeal airway placement and securement by the surgical team before handing over the airway to the anesthesia team.
- **CSF Leak Considerations**:
  - If there's an increased risk, consider exchanging the endotracheal tube for a supraglottic airway (Bailey’s maneuver) under deep anesthesia to reduce coughing on emergence.

### Postoperative Management

- **Airway Compromise**:
  - May require immediate rescue with a supraglottic airway or intubation.
  - Avoid mask ventilation whenever possible to prevent pneumocephalus and infection.
- **CSF Leak Precautions**:
  - Avoid coughing, straining, and the use of straws.
  - Large CSF leaks may necessitate reoperation and/or CSF diversion.
- **Endocrinology Consultation**:
  - Essential for monitoring and managing hormonal insufficiencies such as adrenal insufficiency, panhypopituitarism, and diabetes insipidus.
- **Monitoring for Diabetes Insipidus (DI)**:
  - If urine output exceeds 200-250 mL/hour for two consecutive hours, perform diagnostic tests (paired urine/serum osmolality, serum sodium, serum specific gravity).
  - Monitor serum sodium every 4-6 hours.
  - Diagnosis is based on low urine osmolality (<200 mOsm/L) with high serum osmolality (>310 mOsm/L) and low urine specific gravity (<1.005).
- **Treatment of DI**:
  - Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) is the treatment of choice:
	- 1 mg orally or 0.5 mcg subcutaneous as a single dose or every 12 hours until DI resolves.
	- Free water replacement may be required until DDAVP is administered.
- **Stress Dose Steroid Replacement**:
  - Recommended for most cases except Cushing’s disease (ACTH secreting).
  - In Cushing’s disease, additional steroids may need to be withheld to avoid excess and ensure cortisol levels drop.
  - Serial cortisol measurements may guide the need for steroids.
  - Endocrinology consultation is recommended for guidance on perioperative steroid administration.
