# General

## CSF

### Functions
- Homeostasis of the brain extracellular fluid and maintenance of normal neuronal function.
- Provision of micronutrients to cerebral tissue, clearance of waste products of nerve metabolism, and maintenance of ionic homeostasis.
- Acts as a mediator of intracranial compliance through free flow between cranial and spinal compartments.
- Provides buoyancy, significantly reducing the effective weight of the brain.

### Production
- Total adult CSF volume: approximately 150 ml (125 ml in cranial and spinal subarachnoid channels, 25 ml in ventricles).
- Most CSF produced by ependymal cells of the choroid plexus; a small proportion formed around cerebral vessels from brain interstitial fluid.
- CSF formation is independent of cerebral perfusion pressure and intracranial pressure (ICP) until ICP is significantly elevated.

### Flow
- From lateral ventricles into the third ventricle via the interventricular foramen of Monro, then into the fourth ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius.
- Exits the fourth ventricle through the foramina of Luschka (laterally) and Magendie (medially), flowing into basal cisterns and over the cerebral hemisphere.
- CSF flow throughout the neuro-axis occurs in a pulsatile fashion related to the cardiac cycle.

### Reabsorption
- **Route 1:** Directly into blood via arachnoid granulations along cranial venous sinuses.
- **Route 2:** Alongside cranial and spinal nerve roots, particularly olfactory nerves passing through the cribriform plate.
- Rate of absorption driven by ICP, with resistance to outflow provided by arachnoid granulations and intracranial venous sinus pressure.
- Ventricular pressure governed by the law of Laplace: \(P = \frac{2T}{R} \).

# Classification of Hydrocephalus

## Communicating Hydrocephalus
- Free flow and transmission of CSF pressure waves from ventricles into basal cisterns and spinal CSF channels.
- Commonly caused by impaired CSF reabsorption into cerebral venous sinuses.
- Blockage of arachnoid granulations by red-cell breakdown products due to intraventricular or subarachnoid haemorrhage from trauma, spontaneous events, or surgery.
- Overproduction of CSF (rare) due to choroid plexus papilloma.
- Increased intraventricular pressure distends the brain and compresses periventricular brain tissue against non-compressible fluid in the ventricle.

## Non-communicating Hydrocephalus
- CSF flow blockage at any point within the ventricular system due to tumour growth, intracerebral haemorrhage, or focal mass lesions.
- Common cause: Aqueduct stenosis, either congenital internal narrowing or external compression by pineal region tumour.
- Patients often present with significantly raised ICP requiring acute emergency intervention.

*Distinction between communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus is critical; the former can usually be drained safely by the lumbar route. Communicating hydrocephalus can become non-communicating if lateral ventricles enlarge and compress the cerebral aqueduct.*

## Types and Aetiologies of Hydrocephalus

### Communicating Hydrocephalus

#### Congenital
- Achondroplasia
- Craniofacial syndromes
- Other skull base deformities

#### Acquired
- Subarachnoid/intraventricular haemorrhage
- Choroid plexus papilloma or carcinoma
- Post-infectious

### Non-communicating Hydrocephalus

#### Congenital
- Aqueduct stenosis
- Vein of Galen aneurysm
- Chiari malformations
- X-linked hydrocephalus
- Dandy–Walker malformation

#### Acquired
- Tumours
- Post-inflammatory adhesions
- Cerebellar haematomas/infarcts

# Management

- **Operative Intervention**: Diversion of CSF from the right lateral ventricle, sometimes left lateral ventricle or lumbar spinal thecal.

## External Ventricular Drain (EVD)
- Intracranial placement in the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle; other end tunnelled under scalp skin.
- Height of burette and scale adjusted to ‘zero’ at foramen of Monro (external auditory meatus level).
- Burette height set based on opening pressure at drain insertion and ventricle size.
- Aim to control pressure; with low pressure hydrocephalus, set lower to drain a fixed amount per hour (normally 10 ml, up to 20 ml).
- Infection risk: 5-20%.
- Burette and scale re-zeroed when patient’s position changes.

## Lumbar Drain
- Used for communicating hydrocephalus types.

## Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy
- Bypasses CSF flow obstructions at aqueduct level due to congenital stenosis or pineal region tumours.
- Avoids common shunt complications (infection, blockage) and prevents shunt-dependency.

### Anaesthesia Considerations
- Surgery duration: 45 minutes to 2 hours.
- Tunnelling is painful; minimal postoperative pain.
- CVP and A-line normally not required.

## Surgery for Patient with CSF Shunt
- **Neuraxial**
	- There is no absolute contraindication to spinal anaesthesia in patients with CSF shunts, although it is often avoided because of concerns about the risk of shunt contamination or CNS infection.
	- There is no evidence that dural puncture after a spinal anaesthetic compromises the function of the shunt
- **Laparoscopic surgery
	- Concern is regarding whether or not the shunt system might fail under the pressure of the pneumoperitoneum.
	- Good practice is observation by the surgeon of continuous CSF flow from the distal end of the catheter at the start, during, and at the end of the procedure.
	- Minimising the duration and the pressure of pneumoperitoneum are also suggested
	- Can it be done?
		- Yes it is safe due to the one way valve.
		- It may slow drainage slightly but it has a minimal effect if the surgery is not prolonged and if insufflation pressure is limited. 
		- However if the shunt was recently placed wait for 2 weeks prior to laparoscopy due to risk of surgical emphasema along tract.
### How to Use a Lumbar Drain

Transducer level at the tragus of the ear

Aim for pressures less than 10mmhg

Drain max 10ml alequoits to relieve pressure

Usual drainage = 10ml/hr (as CSF hourly turn over =10-20ml/hr)
