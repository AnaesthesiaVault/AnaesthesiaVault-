# Myasthenia Gravis

## Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314142442.png)

# Myasthenia Gravis

## Aetiology

- **Myasthenia gravis (MG)** is an autoimmune disorder characterized by fatigable weakness of skeletal muscles.
- Weakness results from an antibody-mediated immunologic attack directed at acetylcholine receptors (or receptor-associated proteins) in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction.
- **IgG autoantibodies** interact with the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at the nicotinic neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The AChR antibodies reduce the number of functional receptors by blocking the attachment of acetylcholine molecules, increasing the rate of degradation of the receptors, and causing complement-induced damage to the NMJ.

## Pathogenesis

### Acquired Autoimmunity

- **Mechanism Unknown**

### Thymus Abnormalities

- **Thymoma** (10% of patients) and **thymic hyperplasia** (30%).

### Autoantibodies

- **Anti-MuSK Abs** (7% of patients)
- **Anti-AChR Abs** (85% of patients)
- **10% of patients are seronegative**

### Mechanisms

- **Anti-MuSK Abs**: Disrupt AChR trafficking and clustering on the postsynaptic membrane.
- **Anti-AChR Abs**: Blockade of ACh binding site and promotion of aggregation and internalization of AChR.

### AChR Function

- Decreased AChR function leads to:
  - **Synaptic Rundown**: Progressive decline in ACh release at the neuromuscular junction.
  - **Response to ACh Signaling**: Progressive muscle contraction weakening.
  - **Degradation of AChR**.

### Bedside Tests

- **Repetitive Nerve Stimulation Test**: Decreased CMAP with consecutive nerve stimulations.
- **Single Fiber EMG**: Jitter indicating neuromuscular junction dysfunction.
- **Edrophonium Test**: Improvement with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.
- **Ice Pack Test**: Improved neuromuscular transmission at lower temperatures.

## Clinical Findings

### Muscle Strength

- **Improvement with Rest**

### Fatigability

- **Progressive Weakening** with repeated use.

### Muscle Groups Affected

- **Ocular and Extraocular Muscles**: Ptosis, diplopia.
- **Bulbar Muscles**: Dysarthria, dysphagia.
- **Limb Muscles**: Arm > leg weakness.
- **Neck Muscles**: Extensor weakness.
- **Respiratory Muscles**: Respiratory insufficiency ("myasthenic crisis").

## Classification

### Type I

- **Ocular Signs and Symptoms Only**

### Type IIA

- **Generalized Mild Muscle Weakness** responding well to therapy.

### Type IIB

- **Generalized Moderate Muscle Weakness** responding less well to therapy.

### Type III

- **Acute Fulminating Presentation** and/or respiratory dysfunction.

### Type IV

- **Myasthenic Crisis** requiring artificial ventilation.

## Background

- Autoimmune disorder characterized by weakness and fatigability of skeletal muscles.
- Weakness results from an antibody-mediated immunological attack directed at acetylcholine receptors (or receptor-associated proteins) in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction.

## Treatment Options

### Anticholinesterases

- Enhance neuromuscular transmission by delaying degradation of ACh at the NMJ.
- **Pyridostigmine**: Commonly used drug, acts within 30 minutes, has a peak effect at 2 hours, and a clinical half-life of approximately 4 hours.
- Effects may diminish over months; most patients require immunosuppression.

### Immunosuppression

- **Corticosteroids**
- Long-term immunotherapy: azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, and tacrolimus.

### Thymectomy

- For patients with MG up to 60 years or patients with thymoma.
- Aim is to induce remission.

### Plasma Exchange

- Short-term remission in myasthenic crisis or those needing improvement before thymectomy.
- Resolution within days but short-lived.

### IV Immunoglobulin

- Complications: headaches and renal failure.

### Avoidance of Exacerbating Drugs

- Polymyxins and aminoglycosides.
- Procainamide, quinine, beta-blockers.

### Monoclonal Antibodies

- For refractory cases to conventional treatment.

## Considerations

- Continuation of MG medication up to the time of surgery.
- Use of ultrashortor short-acting sedatives, hypnotics, and anesthetic agents.

### Bulbar/Skeletal Muscle Weakness

- Increased risk of:
  - Aspiration.
  - Perioperative respiratory failure.

### Potential Systemic Complications

- Thymoma & possible anterior mediastinal mass.
- Myocarditis causing cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, heart block.

### Altered Response to Neuromuscular Blocking Medications

- Very sensitive to NdMR (nondepolarizing muscle relaxants): avoid or use 1/10 normal dose with continuous monitoring.
  - When the use of an NMBA is required, administration of a steroidal NMBA (e.g., rocuronium or vecuronium) is suggested to allow reversal with sugammadex (Grade 2C). Small doses should be titrated to effect, guided by monitoring with a quantitative train-of-four peripheral nerve stimulator whenever possible.
  - Reversal of NMBAs with sugammadex is suggested (Grade 2C). When sugammadex is unavailable, reversal with neostigmine should be titrated to effect. Reversal should be assessed with a quantitative train-of-four peripheral nerve stimulator whenever possible, aiming for a fourth-to-first twitch ratio of ≥0.9.
- Resistant to succinylcholine (ED95 2.6X normal).
- Treatment: steroids, immunosuppressants, anticholinesterases.
- Risk of perioperative myasthenic or cholinergic crises.
  - Postoperative monitoring and/or hospital admission should be individualized based on clinical features, risk factors for myasthenic crisis, surgical procedure, type of anesthetic, intraoperative and immediate postoperative course, and need for postoperative care, including pain relief.

### Monitoring Neuromuscular Blockade

- Patients with severe MG may have a pre-op TOF ratio < 0.9, predicting reduced atracurium requirement.
- Sensitive to NDMR (→ ↓ dose), resistant to Sux (→ ↑ dose, readily develop Phase II block).
- Monitor pre-op and continue monitoring post-op.
- Volatiles can reduce NMJ transmission by 50% → monitor NS even when not paralyzing.
- Reversal with Sugammadex is best.

## Goals

- Minimize risk of aspiration (prophylaxis, RSI).
- Minimize risk of perioperative respiratory failure (judicious NMBs & opioids) & anticipate need for post-op ventilation.
- Minimize risk of myasthenic or cholinergic crisis.
- Optimize neuromuscular function.

## Conflicts

- RSI vs altered response to neuromuscular blockers.
- RSI vs cardiac involvement.
- RSI vs anterior mediastinal mass.
- Magnesium for pre-eclampsia in pregnancy vs contraindicated due to muscle weakness.

## Pregnancy Considerations

- 1/3 improve, 1/3 stay the same, 1/3 get worse.
- Pregnant patients with MG should have antepartum anesthesia consultation to plan for labor analgesia and for anesthesia for potential instrumented or operative delivery. The degree of bulbar and respiratory dysfunction should be assessed, as well as the ability to tolerate a midthoracic level of neuraxial anesthesia.
- Exacerbations usually in the 1st trimester with improvement in the 2nd & 3rd.
- ~30% experience relapse postpartum.
- Increased abortion, preterm labor, maternal morbidity & mortality.
- Cholinesterase inhibitors: minimal placental transfer but have uterotonic effects.
- Monitor for fatigue/weakness during labor (consider measuring vital capacity).
- Magnesium is relatively contraindicated due to muscle weakness.
- Generally, neuraxial anesthesia preferred (for labor & vaginal or cesarian delivery) unless severe bulbar or respiratory involvement, then consider general anesthetic for cesarian delivery.
  - Ester local anesthetics may have prolonged half-life in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors → increased risk of toxicity, use amide local anesthetics.
  - In patients with moderate respiratory compromise, the use of BiPAP may improve the safety of neuraxial anesthesia.
- Be prepared for transfer to ICU for postpartum ventilation if severe disease.
- Neonatal myasthenia in 16% due to transfer of maternal IgG antibodies across the placenta, resolves in 3 to 4 weeks.

## Weakness in PACU

### Management

- Attend to patient: rule out airway obstruction, life-threatening hypoventilation, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, or anything requiring immediate airway management & PPV.
- Examine:
  - Vitals.
  - Aspiration, sepsis, surgical complication.
  - Myasthenic crisis (weakness improves with tensilon test).
  - Cholinergic crisis (salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea, GI symptoms, emesis, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, bronchorrhea).
- Review medications given in OR, PACU.
- Send ABG, electrolytes.
# Myasthenic Crisis Vs Cholinergic Crisis

## Myasthenic Crisis

- **Precipitating Factors**: Surgery, administration of NMBAs, infections, electrolyte abnormalities, pregnancy, emotional stress, drugs (aminoglycosides), interruption of immunosuppressants.
- **Management**:
	- Requires endotracheal intubation and ventilation, intensive care, and often rapid immunomodulating therapy.
	- Improvement with edrophonium (Tensilon test):
		- **Tensilon Test**: 1.5 mg increments of edrophonium to 10 mg total (improvement within 2 minutes).
	- Consider elective intubation if vital capacity < 20cc/kg or maximum inspiratory force worse than -30 cmH2O.
	- **Pyridostigmine**:
		- PO: 30-120 mg/day, onset 15-30 min, peak 2 hrs, duration 4 hrs.
		- IV dose is 1/30 of PO dose.
	- Alternative treatment: **Neostigmine** 0.5-2.5 mg IV/SC q1-3 hours titrated to response (max = 10mg/24 hours).
	- Neurology consult for management (plasmapheresis, IVIG, steroids).

## Cholinergic Crisis

- **Cause**: Excessive administration of anticholinesterase medication.
- **Symptoms**:
	- **SLUDGE BBB**: Salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea, GI symptoms, emesis, bradycardia, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm.
- **Distinguishing Feature**:
	- **Edrophonium (Tensilon) Test**:
		- Improvement if myasthenic crisis.
		- Worsening if cholinergic crisis.
- **Management**:
	- Endotracheal intubation.
	- Atropine administration.
	- Cessation of cholinesterase inhibitors until the crisis is over.

## Summary

### Avoid Neuromuscular Blocking Agents

- **Unpredictable Reactions to NDMR**:
	- Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can cause resistance to and delayed onset of NDMR.
	- The disease itself causes sensitivity to NDMR (requires 10-20% of normal dose).
- **Resistance to Suxamethonium**:
	- Requires 2-2.5 times the normal dose.
	- Risk of phase II block.
- **Reversal**:
	- Prefer sugammadex over neostigmine where possible.
	- TOF (Train-of-Four) monitoring with NDMR used.

### Intubation and Anesthesia

- **Remifentanil**: Can be used for intubation (4-5 mcg/kg + intubate after 2.5 minutes, with ephedrine bolus to counteract bradycardia and hypotension).
- **Inhalational Agents**: Cause dose-dependent neuromuscular relaxation.
- **Ultrashort Acting Agents**: Minimize respiratory depression.
- **Local/Regional Anesthesia**: Preferred where possible.
	- Beware of paralysing accessory muscles of breathing and diaphragmatic weakness if bulbar or respiratory compromise is present.

### Aspiration Risk

- Increased with bulbar symptoms.

### Postoperative Care

- **ICU/PACU Bed**: Required postoperatively.
- **MG Medication Management**: Plan postoperative continuation.
- **Avoid Drugs That Exacerbate Myasthenic Crisis**.

## Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314142728.png)

## Pathogenesis

### Acquired Autoimmunity

- **Mechanism Unknown**, often associated with other autoimmune diseases.

### Paraneoplastic Syndrome

- **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)** in >50% of patients.
- Tumor membrane expresses **Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels (VGCCs)**.

### Immune Response

- **Antibodies against VGCCs** on presynaptic neurons.

### Antibody Mechanisms

- **Bind VGCCs**: Block Ca2+ influx.
- **Internalize VGCCs**: Decrease VGCC on neuron surface.

### Ca2+ Influx

- Decreased Ca2+ influx leads to:
	- Reduced neurotransmitter release.
	- Decreased acetylcholine (ACh) release into the synaptic cleft.

### ACh Release

- Decreased ACh leads to:
	- Autonomic dysfunction.
	- Decreased muscle reflexes.

### Post-Activation Facilitation

- Repeated stimulation improves symptoms.

## Clinical Findings

### Muscle Strength

- **Temporary Improvement** with high-frequency repetitive stimulation.

### Deep Tendon Reflexes

- **Increased Amplitude** after exercise.

### Symmetric Skeletal Muscle Weakness

- Larger proximal muscles involved in movement (e.g., walking).

### Specific Symptoms

- **Xerostomia**: Dry mouth.
- **Erectile Dysfunction**.
- **Constipation**.
- **Dysarthria**: Difficulty speaking.
- **Dysphagia**: Difficulty swallowing.
- **Ptosis**: Drooping of upper eyelid.

### Bedside Tests

- **Compound Muscle Action Potentials (CMAPs)**: Baseline summated action potentials.
- **Electromyography**: Unstable motor unit action potentials.

## Background

- Unlike MG, patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) are sensitive to both depolarizing and nondepolarizing NMBAs.
- Autoantibodies are directed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels.
- Decreased release of acetylcholine.
- Frequently associated with cancers (paraneoplastic syndrome).

## Considerations

- Muscle weakness predisposing to respiratory failure after anesthesia; potential need for post-op positive pressure ventilation (PPV).
- Associated with lung carcinoma.
- Extremely sensitive to both succinylcholine and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (NdMRs).
- Autonomic dysfunction present in 30% of patients.

## Optimization

- Counsel and prepare for postoperative PPV/ICU.
- Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) preparation may help increase muscle strength.

## Goals

- Minimize use of neuromuscular blockers.
- Optimize postoperative ventilation status.
- Prefer regional anesthesia over general anesthesia if possible.
