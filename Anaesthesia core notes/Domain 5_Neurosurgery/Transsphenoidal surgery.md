# Epidemiology

Pituitary tumours constitute the third most common intracranial tumour, accounting for 10-15% of adult brain tumours. They have a prevalence of 16.7%. Most pituitary adenomas (PAs) are benign and slow-growing, with poorly understood aetiology. Pituitary carcinomas are rare, accounting for less than 0.2% of cases. PAs are classified by size into macroadenomas (>10 mm) and microadenomas (≤10 mm), and by function into functioning/hormone-secreting (46-64%) or non-functioning (36-54%) tumours. Functioning PAs secrete hormones such as prolactin, growth hormone (GH), or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), leading to conditions such as acromegaly and Cushing’s disease.

# Clinical Features

Pituitary tumours may present with mass effect symptoms, hormonal hyposecretion or hypersecretion syndromes, or may be incidentally discovered. Tumours secreting GH and ACTH lead to acromegaly and Cushing's disease, requiring surgical resection for biochemical cure. Mass effect symptoms include headaches and visual disturbances, such as bitemporal hemianopia and decreased visual acuity. Compression of the pituitary gland can lead to hormonal insufficiency, such as panhypopituitarism or diabetes insipidus (DI).

# Preoperative Care

A multidisciplinary approach involving endocrinology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, ENT, radiology, and anaesthesia is essential. Preoperative assessment includes a comprehensive history, physical examination (with focus on cardiovascular, respiratory, and airway systems), and visual assessments. Baseline investigations include serum electrolytes, renal function, hormone profiling, ECG, echocardiogram, and MRI for tumour mapping. CT scans of the sinuses may assist in surgical planning.

Patients with acromegaly present a higher risk of difficult airways. Airway evaluation with flexible nasal endoscopy is useful in such cases, especially in the presence of laryngeal involvement (hoarseness, dyspnoea). Consideration of awake tracheal intubation is recommended for high-risk patients.

# Surgical Approach

The **transsphenoidal approach** is the standard for pituitary adenoma resection. This minimally invasive approach has fewer postoperative complications compared to the transcranial approach, which is reserved for large or invasive tumours. Intraoperative computer-assisted navigation is often used to enhance surgical accuracy.

# Intraoperative Management

- **Anaesthesia Goals**: Ensure haemodynamic stability, optimal cerebral perfusion, and smooth emergence. Patients with acromegaly are at a four-to fivefold increased risk of difficult airway, so difficult airway equipment should be available.
- **Airway Management**: Supraglottic airways may assist ventilation in cases of difficult facemask ventilation. Video laryngoscopy is frequently used for tracheal intubation, especially in patients with anticipated difficult airways.
- **Monitoring**: Standard monitors should include depth of anaesthesia (especially with TIVA), invasive arterial pressure monitoring, and possibly urinary catheterisation for complex cases with anticipated DI.
- **Conduct of Anaesthesia**: TIVA is often preferred, as it is associated with reduced blood loss and better surgical visualisation compared to inhalational anaesthetics.
- **Complications**: Venous bleeding, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks (2-12%), and vascular injury (such as internal carotid artery (ICA) injury) are major intraoperative risks. Venous air embolism is rare but possible.

# Postoperative Care

Patients are generally monitored in a neurosurgical ward postoperatively. Patients with challenging airways or metabolic disturbances may require monitoring in a level 2 critical care unit. The most common postoperative complications include CSF rhinorrhoea and diabetes insipidus (DI). CSF leaks may necessitate stool softeners and avoidance of straining or nose blowing for up to 6 weeks postoperatively. Early detection and treatment of DI are crucial, and persistent DI may require desmopressin.

# Hormonal Management and Complications

Endocrinologists should guide postoperative hormonal therapy. Patients must be monitored for potential complications such as epistaxis, meningitis, visual impairment, and stroke.
