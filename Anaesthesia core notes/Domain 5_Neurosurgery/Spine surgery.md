# General

### Major Spinal Surgery
- Commonly associated with massive hemorrhage.
- Airway compromise reported in up to 1.9% of patients post-cervical spine surgery.

### Consent
- Significant incidence of complications in major spinal operations.
- Essential for patient understanding and realistic expectations regarding surgical outcomes.
- Risks to discuss:
  - Major blood loss
  - Infection
  - Postoperative respiratory complications
  - Use of cell saver and cyklokapron
  - 1% risk of spinal cord damage and paralysis

### Anaesthesia
- **Endotracheal Tube (ETT)**
  - Must be carefully secured; difficult extubation in prone position.
  - Plan for difficult extubation; LMA insertion is often effective.
- **Intravenous Access**
  - Large bore IV cannulae, well secured.
- **Arterial Line**
  - Considerations: expected blood loss, patient comorbidities, need for postoperative critical care.
  - Low threshold for insertion; useful for monitoring and blood access.
- **Central Venous Pressure (CVP)**
  - Consider placement.
- **Urinary Catheterization**
  - Required for all major cases or surgeries anticipated to last more than 2 hours.
  - Enlarging bladder may cause increased intraoperative blood loss due to pressure on valveless epidural veins.
- **Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA)**
  - Use with BIS for intraoperative spinal monitoring.
  - Remifentanil is commonly used due to its short context-sensitive half-life and minimal effect on intraoperative evoked responses.
- **Blood Loss Management**
  - Awareness of major blood loss strategies: cell salvage, cross-matched blood, cyklokapron, TEG.
- **Analgesia**
  - Multimodal approach with opioid backbone and paracetamol.
  - Ketamine: 1 mg/kg bolus, followed by 1–2 mg/kg/h (42–84 mg/kg/h).
  - Gabapentin and pregabalin to reduce postoperative pain and chronic pain development.
  - Pregabalin: consistent bioavailability, doses vary from 150 to 600 mg pre-surgery followed by 50–300 mg for up to 14 days post-surgery.
- **Emergence**
  - Aim for smooth emergence.
  - Low-dose remifentanil infusion to maintain systolic arterial pressure between 120 and 160 mm Hg, adjusted based on preoperative arterial pressure.
## Blood Loss

Surgical procedures are divided into three classes based on the extent of surgery: Minor, major, and complex. Considerations for the intraoperative management of patients undergoing spine surgery are class-specific. Procedures are listed in the table below:

| Minor (EBL <100ml)                                                 | Major (EBL 100-1000ml)       | Complex (EBL 1-10L)                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-2 level ACDF                                                     | 3-4 level ACDF/PCDF          | 6-18 level instrumentation          |
| ≤ 2 level decompression or microdiscectomy without instrumentation | 1-3 level ALIF/XLIF          | ≥ 3 level anterior/posterior fusion |
|                                                                    | 1-2 level TLIF               | Pedicle Subtraction Osteotomy (PSO) |
|                                                                    | 1-2 level anterior/posterior | Vertebral Column Resection (VCR)    |
|                                                                    | Degenerative corpectomy      | Tumor corpectomy                    |
|                                                                    |                              | Tumor debulking                     |

## Airway Complications
- Risk factors include multiple level surgery, blood loss of more than 300 ml, duration more than 5 h, a combined anterior and posterior operation and previous cervical surgery.
- Airway compromise may be attributable to haematoma formation or supraglottic oedema secondary to venous and lymphatic obstruction. Symptoms usually develop within 6 but up to 36 h after surgery and include neck swelling, change in voice quality, agitation, and signs of respiratory distress. Tracheal deviation may occur and compression of the carotid sinus can cause bradycardia with hypotension.

## How to Safely Position
- Foam bolsters are commonly used, one at the level of the chest below the axillae and the other at the level of the anterior superior iliac spines.
- The arms should be abducted to no more than 90, with slight internal rotation and lie in front of the plane of the body to reduce the risk of brachial plexus injury.
- Particular attention should be paid to the ulnar nerve at the elbow which is at risk of pressure-related injury when the arms are flexed in the prone position
- If the arms remain by the patient’s side, then the thumbs should be positioned pointing down to avoid over pronation.
- Care is required to avoid pressure on the abdomen as this will be transmitted to the venous system and cause increased bleeding from the valveless epidural veins
- The eyes are kept closed to protect the tear film and padding should be avoided
### Examples of Support for Spinal Surgery

![[Pasted image 20231026160515.png]]

## ETT Vs LMA

### Considerations for LMA Use in Prone Position
- **Advantages:**
  - Reduced requirement for extra staff for positioning.
  - Reduced time to incision.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Only anaesthetic providers skilled in LMA use should consider using them in prone position.
  - Plan to immediately turn patient supine if problems arise.
  - ProSeal and Supreme devices may offer advantages.
  - Suitable for non-obese patients with normal airway anatomy and minimal aspiration risk.
  - Consider only for short procedures.

## GA Vs Regional Anaesthesia

### Evidence and Considerations
- **1-2 Level Lumbar Laminectomy or Disc Surgery:**
  - No significant difference in morbidity, mortality, or long-term complications between general and regional anaesthesia.
  - Regional anaesthesia may provide better haemodynamic profile and reduce narcotic requirements.
  - Less blood loss and decreased nausea/vomiting with regional anaesthesia.
  - Avoids brachial pressure injury and pressure necrosis due to patient self-positioning.
  - Heavy sedation may negate these advantages.
  - Potential reduction in dementia for elderly patients by avoiding GA remains to be validated.

### Contraindications to Regional Anaesthesia
- Patient refusal
- Severe or multi-level spinal stenosis
- History of seizures
- History of intracranial hypertension
- Coagulopathy
- Infection at needle insertion site
- Hypovolemia
- Near complete-total myelographic block
- Myelographic demonstration of arachnoiditis

## Hypotensive Anaesthesia

### Definition
- **SBP:** 80-90 mmHg
- **MAP:** 50-65 mmHg
- **Reduction:** 30% of baseline BP
# The Prone Position

## Cardiovascular

- **↓ CI**
	- ↓ VR
	- Direct effects on arterial filling
	- ↓ LV compliance due to ↑ intrathoracic pressure
- **IVC compression**
	- ↓ CO
	- ↑ blood loss
	- Venous stasis → thrombotic complications
- **↑ Sympathetic response to change in position**

## Respiratory

- **Lung volumes**
	- ↑ FRC
	- FEV1 and FVC relatively unchanged
- **Distribution of blood flow**
	- Lung perfusion more uniformly distributed in prone position
- **Distribution of ventilation**
	- More even vertical distribution of ventilation in prone position

## Complications

### CNS

- **Occlusion of vertebral and carotid arteries**
	- Avoid excessive extension or rotation of the neck when turning
- **Venous occlusion**
- **Air entrainment**
	- Possible pneumocephalus
- **Cervical spine injury**
	- Avoid excessive neck flexion/extension

### PNS

- Peripheral nerve injuries may occur in any position and are thought to be the end result of nerve ischaemia from undue stretching or direct pressure. Patients at risk include:
	- Diabetes
	- Peripheral vascular disease
	- Alcohol dependency
	- Pre-existing neuropathy
	- Anatomical variants
	- Previous post-operative neurological problems

**Recommendation:** It may be prudent to assess them in the proposed operative position while awake. Arms should be positioned next to the side rather than abducted.

### Pressure Injuries

- May be direct or indirect (when injury occurs as a result of pressure on, or occlusion of, vascular supply).

#### Direct

- Pressure necrosis of skin (face, breasts, ears, genitalia, iliac crests)
- Contact dermatitis
- Tracheal compression (reported in patients with underlying anatomical abnormalities)
- Salivary gland swelling (postulated to result from stretching of salivary ducts, leading to stasis and acute swelling)
- Shoulder dislocation (distribution of pressure may lead to anterior dislocation of the shoulder)

#### Indirect

- Macroglossia and oropharyngeal swelling (thought to be caused by excessive flexion of the neck, obstructing the internal jugular vein which in turn obstructs the lingual and pharyngeal veins)
- Mediastinal compression (possible in patients with chest wall abnormalities)
- Visceral ischaemia (hepatic ischaemia and pancreatitis have been described)
- Avascular necrosis of femoral head (described in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip in the prone position subjected to a hypotensive anaesthetic technique)
- Peripheral vessel occlusion
- Limb compartment syndromes and rhabdomyolysis

### Embolic Complications

- **Venous gas embolism:** Efforts to minimize abdominal compression and thus IVC pressure in the prone position can result in an increased negative pressure gradient between the right atrium and veins at the operative site. It is important to maintain intravascular volume to minimize the risk.
- **Non-gaseous embolism:** A few reports exist of fat, cement, and bone fragment emboli.

# POVL

[[Post operative vision loss (POVL)]]

# Spinal Cord Monitoring (SCM)
- The risk of permanent damage after surgery to correct idiopathic scoliosis is about 1:1000 procedures.
- Most neurologic damage is due to ischaemia of the spinal cord caused by instrumental distraction, disruption of arterial blood supply and compression due to haematoma formation
- Patients with severe deformity, congenital scoliosis, kyphosis or preoperative abnormal neurology are at increased risk
- Any intraoperative compromise of spinal cord function needs to be detected as soon as possible and reversed immediately in order to improve neurological outcome
## Testing
### Clinical
- **Wake up test**
	- anaesthesia will be "lightened" and they will be asked to move their hands and then their feet.
	- They are reassured that they will feel no pain, will be re-anaesthetised immediately afterwards and will probably not recall the incident after surgery.
	- The test is performed once the instrumentation has been applied. Anaesthesia is lightened until the patient responds to commands.
	- The patient should not be awakened abruptly as bucking, coughing and sudden movement may result in tubes, lines and monitors being displaced.
	- Sudden deep inspiration by the patient increases the risk of venous air embolism
	- Surgery should only continue once the patient no longer responds to commands.
- **Ankle clonus test**
	- Elicited in normal people in a light plane of anaesthesia
	- During arousal this typically occurs before the patient is sufficiently responsive for the wake up test but it is a transient phenomenon which may be missed.
- These two techniques have the advantage of requiring no specialized personnel or equipment and will continue to be used where resources are limited
- They may also need to be used where electrophysiological monitoring techniques fail or yield equivocal results
- However they only provide evidence of cord function at the time of the test. Furthermore the wake up test demonstrates only motor function and may miss a sensory deficit. It cannot be done in the very young, the mentally handicapped or deaf patient.
### Neurophysiological or Evoked Potentials
- **Sensory evoked potentials (SEP)**
	- Cortical sensory evoked potentials (CSEP) are most commonly used because they mimic SEP obtained in the awake state; they are non-invasive and can be used throughout the procedure.
	- Stimuli are applied to surface electrodes and hence to peripheral nerves from which sensory fibres will pass through the surgical field. Typically the posterior tibial nerve at the ankle or the peroneal nerve at the fibular head (lower extremity) or the ulnar or median nerves at the wrist (upper extremity) are used for stimulation. Evoked potentials are then recorded from surface electrodes applied to the scalp over the relevant sensory cortex or they may be recorded at the level of the brainstem. At the brainstem level they are minimally affected by anaesthetic agents. They are however sensitive to changes in blood pressure and CO2 tension. Recordings from the cortex are more sensitive to anaesthetic agents particularly inhalational agents
	- The most widely used threshold for concern is a 50% reduction in amplitude compared with baseline preoperative records and a 10% increase in latency
	- Changes close to the threshold may be difficult and confirmation of normal function by means of a wake-up test may still be indicated
	- Spinal SEP are preferred in some institutions because although they require an invasive technique where recordings are made from an electrode inserted into the epidural space by the surgeon, they are more resistant to depressant effects of anaesthetics and physiological changes. Typically stimulation is applied percutaneously to the posterior tibial nerve at each knee and the evoked potentials are recorded from a bipolar electrode inserted into the epidural space in the high thoracic region
- **Motor evoked potentials**
	- Obtained by stimulating rostral to the site of surgery and recording the evoked signal distally. The stimulation is transcranial and the recording may be made from the spinal cord, from peripheral nerves or from a muscle in which a compound muscle action potential (CMAP) is generated. Responses recorded from the epidural space consist of a direct or D wave representing the direct activation of the corticospinal tract (CST) by the transcranial stimulus. In awake or lightly anaesthetised patients, the D wave is followed by a series of I (indirect) waves generated by cortical synapses. These descending cortical volleys then summate to excite anterior horn cells and spinal alpha motor neurons, thereby inducing a compound muscle action potential. The requirement for electrode placement, either percutaneously or by laminotomy, precludes routine use of this form of MEPs.
	- Neurogenic descending evoked potentials elicited from epidural electrospinal stimulation and recorded over lower extremity peripheral nerves were previously thought to be mediated within spinal motor tracts and because of their technical simplicity and minimal alteration by anaesthetic agents were popular for a period. It is now recognised that these potentials are mediated through spinal cord pathways that are in common with pathways responsible for SEPs. It is therefore a mixed or pure sensory response.
- **Electromyography**
	- SEPs are neither sensitive nor specific for identifying an injury to spinal nerve roots
	- Spontaneous electromyography (spEMG) can be used to monitor for injury or neural trauma to spinal nerve roots. During a surgical procedure, microtrauma to a spinal nerve root will provoke ion depolarization, and the resultant muscle or motor unit potential can be recorded from a muscle innervated by that specific nerve root.
	- Stimulus evoked electromyography (stEMG) is another EMG technique that can be used to monitor injury during pedicle screw placement. stEMG allows the detection of a pedicle wall violation during and after pedicle screw fixation. An electrical stimulus is applied to the pedicle screw and EMG activity is recorded from the muscles innervated by the nerve root adjacent to the pedicle. If the pedicle wall is fractured, the nerve root will depolarise at a much lower current mA) compared with a pedicle, causing muscle contraction that is recorded as an EMG response
## Practical Options
### EMG (electromyography)
- stimulating selective nerve roots it will trigger a responsecan alert surgeon they are near a nerve or if there is no response it can show damage has been done.
### MEPsmotor Evoked Potentials

Transcranial/ direct motor cortex stimulation = motor response 

Corticospinal tract stimulation

Posterior spinal artery

Pros:

	Faster than SSEPs

	Better at detecting damage to nerves.

Cons:

	Higher MEP thresholds in <6yrs old

	More sensitive to anaesthetic techniques

### SSEPSomatosensory Evoked Potentials

Stimulate peripheral nerves and monitor response on EEG.

Spinothalamic tract.

Anterior spinal artery

Pros:

	Better at detecting hypoperfusion of spinal cord

Cons:

	Average signal, provide less real time feed back, slower than MEPs

### Stagnara Wake up Test

Dangerous, times consuming, snapshot in time.

Largerly replaced by the above.

However sometimes used if the MEPs and SSEPs fail. So consent all patients for wake up test in case

## Effect of Anaesthetic Agents of Spinal Cord Monitoring
- Volatiles cause a dose dependent increase in latency and decrease in amplitude of somatosensory evoked potentials. The most potent in this regard is isoflurane, followed by enflurane and halothane. Sevoflurane and desflurane are said to have a similar effect to isoflurane. At therapeutic concentrations the halogenated agents abolish TceMEPs.
- Anaesthetic vapour concentrations more than 0.5 MAC are generally not compatible with reliable monitoring
- Neuromuscular blockers have little effect on SEPs, but profound block precludes the recording of CMAPs.
- In practice it is prudent to employ a TIVA technique using an opiate infusion together with a propofol infusion.
- sufentanil is a very useful agent. There is some controversy about the role of remifentanil in postoperative hyperalgesia and until more is known about this phenomenon, remifentanil should probably not be used as the main intraoperative opiate during corrective spinal surgery.
### Effects of Anesthetics on SSEPs and TcMEPs

|**Agent**|**SSEPs**|**TcMEPs**|
|---|---|---|
|**Opiates**|Mild ↓|Mild ↓|
|**Barbiturates**|Variable|Profound|
|**Midazolam**|Mild|Marked|
|**Ketamine**|Enhanced|Enhanced|
|**Etomidate**|Enhanced|↓ amplitude|
|**Propofol**|Mild ↓|Mild ↓|

**Key:**

- **SSEPs:** Somatosensory Evoked Potentials
- **TcMEPs:** Transcranial Motor Evoked Potentials
- **↓:** Decrease in signal

**Summary:**

- **Opiates** result in a mild decrease in both SSEPs and TcMEPs.
- **Barbiturates** have variable effects on SSEPs and cause a profound decrease in TcMEPs.
- **Midazolam** mildly affects SSEPs but causes a marked decrease in TcMEPs.
- **Ketamine** enhances both SSEPs and TcMEPs.
- **Etomidate** enhances SSEPs but decreases the amplitude of TcMEPs.
- **Propofol** results in a mild decrease in both SSEPs and TcMEPs.
## Non-anaesthetic Intraoperative Influences on Evoked Potential Monitoring
- **Spinal cord blood flow.**
	- Mean arterial pressure below the autoregulatory threshold will decrease SSEP amplitude
- **Haematocrit level.**
	- Levels below 15% will decrease amplitude and increase latency
- **PaCO2**
	- A tension less than 20 mmHg will also decrease amplitude and increase latency.
- **Temperature**
	- Moderate hypothermia will decrease amplitude, increase conduction time and latency, and increase stimulation threshold
# Anaesthetic Considerations for Patients with Dorsal Column Stimulator

## Dorsal Column Stimulator
- **Avoid unipolar diathermy.**
- **Avoid neuraxial blocks** due to the risk of lead damage or infection introduction.
- **Consider turning it off** or setting it to the lowest setting for surgery.
- **MRI Imaging:**
  - Although not ferromagnetic, can cause malfunction, poor image quality, device movement, or damage.

## Indications of Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS)

### Good Indications (Likely to Respond)
- Failed back surgery syndrome causing limb pain
- Complex regional pain syndrome
- Neuropathic pain secondary to peripheral nerve damage
- Ischaemic pain associated with peripheral vascular disease
- Refractory angina
- Brachial plexopathy: traumatic or post-irradiation

### Intermediate Indications (May Respond)
- Amputation pain (stump pain responds better than phantom pain)
- Failed back surgery syndrome causing axial pain
- Intercostal neuralgia, e.g., post-thoracotomy or post-herpetic neuralgia
- Pain associated with spinal cord damage

### Poor Indications (Rarely Respond)
- Central pain of non-spinal cord origin
- Spinal cord injury with clinically complete loss of posterior column function
- Perineal, anorectal pain

### Unresponsive to SCS
- Complete cord transection

## Insertion of a Dorsal Column Stimulator
- **Antibiotic prophylaxis:** Administer pre-insertion.
- **Surgical Insertion of Paddles:** Requires a laminectomy (General Anaesthesia).
- **Percutaneous Catheter Insertion:** Inserted into the epidural space using a Tuohy needle.
  - Aim: Achieve paresthesia in the area of pain. Awake patients can guide positioning.
- **Trial and Long-Term Use:** An external pulse generator is used for a trial period, then internalised for long-term use.

# Blood Conservation Strategies

## General Considerations
- **Massive Blood Loss:** Common in spinal surgery, especially corrective spinal surgery.

### Peri-Operative Strategies
- **Autologous Blood Donation:**
  - Considered for patients likely to receive transfusions, though costly and can result in wasted units.
- **Regional Anaesthesia:**
  - Shown to decrease blood loss but may not be practical for all spinal surgeries.
- **Positioning:**
  - Critical to avoid abdominal pressure in prone position to decrease blood flow through collateral vertebral venous plexuses.
- **Ventilation:**
  - Minimise mean intrathoracic pressure during controlled ventilation with minimal PEEP and low tidal volumes.
- **Controlled Hypotensive Techniques:**
  - May be risky in major cases unless employing continuous spinal cord monitoring, especially in severe scoliosis patients.
- **Maintenance of Normothermia:**
  - Essential to decrease transfusion risk. Even mild hypothermia increases blood loss by ~16% and transfusion risk by ~22%. Use warming devices and monitor temperature.
- **Acute Normovolaemic Haemodilution:**
  - Diluting blood volume reduces red blood cells and plasma constituents during surgical bleeding.
- **Surgical Technique:**
  - Skilled surgeon with appropriate vasoconstrictor use. Minimally invasive surgery where appropriate.
- **Cell Salvage:**
  - Collect, process, and reinfuse shed blood. Cost-effective when returning at least 2 RBC packs.
- **Antifibrinolytic Agents:**
  - Tranexamic acid (TA) reduces intraoperative bleeding and transfusion. Dosages vary; higher doses may be more effective but require further studies.
- **Blood Component Transfusion:**
  - Based on patient situation. Restrictive threshold (7-8 g/dL) generally warranted. Other blood products should be administered based on monitored parameters.
- **Coagulation Monitoring:**
  - Use TEG and Rotem machines to guide blood product administration cost-effectively.

# Post-Operative Complications Expanded

## General

### Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)
- **Prevention Strategies:**
  - Identify high-risk patients.
  - Implement multimodal pharmacologic nausea prophylaxis.
  - Limit opioid administration.
  - Avoid nitrous oxide, inhalational anesthetics, and neostigmine.

### Tongue Injuries
- **Prevention and Management:**
  - Use a "bite block" to keep the tongue behind the incisors and prevent intraoral compression injury.
  - During spine surgery, especially when using motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), protect the tongue from masseter contraction and jaw closure/biting.
  - Ensure careful placement of bite guards and frequent examination of the mouth, face, and eyes.

## Injuries to the Hollow Organs of the Neck

### Airway Injuries
- **Incidence and Risk Factors:**
  - Airway obstruction occurs in 6.1% of multilevel anterior cervical procedures, with a 70% requirement for emergent re-intubation.
  - Risk factors include:
	- Medical comorbidities: Obesity, OSA, pulmonary disease, cervical myelopathy, previous cervical surgery.
	- Anesthetic factors: Poor visualization of the glottis (grade 3 or 4 views) and multiple intubation attempts.
	- Procedural factors: Exposure of more than three cervical levels, especially C2-C4, blood loss >300 mL, operative time >5 hours, combined anterior and posterior approach.
- **Airway Obstruction Timeline:**
  - Wound hematomas typically manifest within the first 12 hours post-surgery.
  - Pharyngeal and prevertebral soft tissue edema usually presents 12-72 hours post-surgery.
  - Airway obstruction after 72 hours may indicate abscess formation, cerebrospinal fluid leak, or construct failure.

### Esophageal Injury
- **Risk Factors:**
  - Common during anterior cervical spine procedures, particularly at Lanier's triangle (C5-C6 junction).
  - The thin fascial layer makes the area prone to injury, especially with instrumentation.

### Dysphagia
- **Incidence and Causes:**
  - Occurs in 57% of patients immediately postoperatively.
  - Multifactorial causes include:
	- Direct surgical manipulation or soft tissue swelling injuring esophageal nerves.
	- Injury to the superior laryngeal nerves, pharyngeal plexus (C2-C5), hypoglossal nerve (above C3), and recurrent laryngeal nerve (below C5).

### Hoarseness
- **Incidence:**
  - Hoarseness and vocal cord paresis reported in up to 24% of cases.

## Positioning

### Perioperative Visual Loss (POVL)

### Perioperative Nerve Injury
- **Incidence and Common Sites:**
  - Occurs in 0.03% to 0.1% of cases.
  - Most common in the ulnar nerve (28%), followed by the brachial plexus (20%) and median nerve (4%).
- **Mechanisms:**
  - Increased intraneural and extraneural pressures, reduced perfusion pressure, neural ischemia, stretch injury, and systemic inflammatory responses.
- **Risk Factors:**
  - Preexisting hypertension, diabetes, advanced age, tobacco use, and complex neurosurgical/orthopedic procedures.

### Skin Breakdown
- **Risk Factors:**
  - Surgical time >3 hours and obesity.
  - Pad and recheck breasts, male genitalia, bony prominences, superficial nerves, and axillae throughout the case.

## Acute Spinal Cord Injury

## Vascular Injury
- **Risk and Incidence:**
  - Intimal dissection without perforation/hemorrhage may not be apparent until postoperative.
  - Thoracolumbar spine surgery can injure the aorta, vena cava, or iliac vessels.

## Cardiovascular Events

### Myocardial Infarction (MI)
- **Incidence and Risk Factors:**
  - Occurs in 1-2%, typically on postoperative day 2.
  - Risk factors include major intraoperative hemorrhage (blood loss requiring >4 units of transfusion).

### Stroke
- **Incidence and Risk Factors:**
  - Occurs in 0.014% to 0.20% of cases.
  - Risk factors include older age, recent MI, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, history of stroke/TIA, dialysis, hypertension, COPD, and current tobacco use.
- **Considerations:**
  - Timing of elective spine surgery post-stroke: risk drops significantly at 3 months, safest after 9 months.
  - Aspirin continuation: generally not indicated except in patients with intra-arterial stents.
  - Postoperative stroke management: systemic thrombolysis contraindicated, consider acute endovascular thrombectomy.

## Respiratory Complications
- **Incidence:**
  - Pulmonary complications occur at a rate of ~13%, with pneumonia being most common.
- **Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression:**
  - Risk increased in smokers; encourage smoking cessation at least 4 weeks preoperatively.
- **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):**
  - Incidence 0.3% to 1.4%, with DVT and PE varying with prophylaxis.
  - Use lower-extremity pneumatic compression devices, mobilization, and pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis postoperatively.
- **Pulmonary Edema/ARDS/TRALI:**
  - Incidence 1.3%; more liberal use of colloid therapy intraoperatively recommended.

## Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
- **Incidence and Causes:**
  - Occurs in 3.9% of cases.
  - Causes include renal hypoperfusion, intravascular hypovolemia, nephrotoxic drugs/contrast agents, and inflammatory responses.

## Ileus
- **Incidence and Risk Factors:**
  - Defined as abdominal distention and no passage of stool/flatus by postoperative day 3.
  - Occurs in 2.3% of spine surgery cases.
  - Risk factors include male gender, increased age, and African American ethnicity.

## Coagulopathy
- **Incidence and Risk Factors:**
  - Blood loss ranges from 1000 to 3000 mL, with postoperative coagulopathy (INR > 2, platelets <50, fibrinogen <100) in 0.82% of cases.
  - High blood loss procedures have a coagulopathy rate of up to 53%.
  - Hypothermia and acidosis can impair coagulation enzyme activity.

## Surgical Site Infection
- **Incidence and Risk Factors:**
  - Occurs in 2-2.5% of cases.
  - Risk factors include neurologic disorders, drug/alcohol abuse, cardiac disorders (excluding hypertension), diabetes mellitus, and obesity.
- **Prevention:**
  - Screen for MRSA, maintain glucose levels (5-10), HbA1c <8.0%, CHG bathing, and prophylactic antibiotics.

## Summary for Optimizing and Preventing Complications
- Conduct thorough cardiopulmonary assessment.
- Ensure careful patient positioning to avoid injuries.
- Implement nausea prophylaxis.
- Utilize multimodal analgesic therapy.
- Apply goal-directed fluid resuscitation to avoid excessive crystalloid administration and reduce tissue edema and POVL risk.
- Maintain adequate spinal cord perfusion pressure.
- Monitor patients at risk for opioid-induced respiratory depression and provide supplemental oxygen; assess OSA patients for possible CPAP/BIPAP therapy.
- Rapidly assess and treat acute postoperative complications, including coagulopathy, myocardial injury, acute stroke, VTE, ileus, and AKI to prevent major morbidity or mortality.
- Promptly obtain imaging for new-onset neurologic deficits to rule out spinal cord/nerve root compression from hematoma or large vessel occlusion.
