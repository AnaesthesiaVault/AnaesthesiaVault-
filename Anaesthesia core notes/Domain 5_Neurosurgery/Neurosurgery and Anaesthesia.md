# Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314145250.png)

# Raised ICP Detection

## Early Signs
- Headache
- Vomiting
- Seizures
- Focal neurology
- Papilloedema

## Late Signs
- Increasing blood pressure and bradycardia
- Agitation, drowsiness, coma
- Cheyne–Stokes breathing, apnoea
- Ipsilateral, then bilateral, pupillary dilatation
- Decorticate, then decerebrate posturing

## Investigations
- Evaluate CT/MRI scans for:
  - Presence of generalized oedema
  - Midline shift
  - Acute hydrocephalus
  - Site and size of any lesion

## ICP Monitors

### Invasive

#### External Ventricular Drain (EVD)
- **Method**: Burr hole and monitor inserted into the ventricles; zeroed.
- **Function**: Can drain CSF if ICP >15-20 mmHg.
- **Complications**: Infection, hemorrhage, over-drainage, occlusion, dampening, and CSF leak.
- **Status**: Gold standard.

#### Micro Transducers
- **Types**:
  - Fiber optic
  - Strain gauges
  - Pneumatic
- **Placement**: Intraparenchymal or intraventricular.
- **Limitation**: Cannot be recalibrated.

### Non-Invasive

#### Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound
- **Function**: Mean velocity and pulsation index correlate with ICP.
- **Limitations**: Not accurate with high ICP, user-dependent.

#### Eyes
- **Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter**: Differentiates raised ICP from normal ICP; not accurate enough to replace invasive measurements.
- **Fundoscopy**: Papilloedema takes time to develop and is not seen acutely.

#### Ears
- **Tympanic Membrane Displacement**

#### MRI
- **Function**: Screening tool for identifying who needs invasive monitoring.
# ICP Management
### 1. Avoid Increasing Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF)

- Prevent hypercapnia, hypoxia, hypertension, and hyperthermia.
- Use intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) to control PaCO2.
- Ensure good oxygenation, adequate analgesia, and appropriate anaesthetic depth.

### 2. Avoid Increasing Venous Pressure

- Prevent coughing and straining.
- Avoid the head-down position and obstructing neck veins with endotracheal tube (ETT) ties.

### 3. Prevent Further Cerebral Oedema

- Avoid fluid overload; restrict IV fluids to 30 mL/kg/day if cerebral oedema is present.
- Do not use hypotonic solutions.
- Maintain high normal plasma osmolality.

### 4. Maintain Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)

- Target CPP >60 mmHg.
- Avoid anaesthetic agents that increase ICP.

### 5. Specific Measures to Decrease Intracranial Pressure

- Administer Mannitol (0.25–1 g/kg over 15 min) or 5% saline (100 mL) and furosemide (0.25–1 mg/kg). Insert a urinary catheter for patients receiving diuretics.
- Implement modest hyperventilation to PaCO2 of 4.0–4.5 kPa (30–34 mmHg); note that EtCO2 is lower than PaCO2.
- Use corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 4 mg 6-hourly) to reduce oedema surrounding tumours and abscesses; not effective for head injury.
- Drain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via ventricular or lumbar drain.
- Position the patient with a head-up tilt of

### 5. Specific Measures to Decrease Intracranial Pressure (cont.)

- Position the patient with a head-up tilt of 30° to reduce central venous pressure (CVP).

### 6. Prevent Seizures

- Administer prophylactic or therapeutic phenytoin (loading dose: 15 mg/kg, maintenance dose: 3–4 mg/kg daily).

### 7. Monitoring

- Use arterial line, central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring, neuromuscular monitoring, and core temperature monitoring.
- Insert a urinary catheter.

### 8. Anaesthetic Technique

- Induction: Propofol (2–3 mg/kg) combined with remifentanil (0.2–0.5 μg/kg/min).
	- Alternatively, fentanyl (5 μg/kg at induction) or alfentanil infusion (25–50 μg/kg/hr).
- Use lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) or a β-blocker (labetalol in 5 mg increments) to blunt responses.
- Administer IV induction agents slowly to avoid reducing BP and CPP.
- Use a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant for intubation.
- Use an armoured endotracheal tube (ETT) to prevent kinking, secured with tape.
- Protect the eyes.
- Avoid nitrous oxide (N2O).
- Maintenance: Use a volatile agent (sevoflurane/isoflurane <1 MAC) or target-controlled infusion (TCI) propofol (3–6 μg/mL), with continued remifentanil infusion at a lower rate (0.15–0.25 μg/kg/min).
- Maintain a straight head position with a slight head elevation.
- Avoid extreme neck flexion or rotation to ensure cerebral venous return.
- Support the shoulder if the head is turned for surgery.
- Use the Mayfield 3-point fixator cautiously to avoid hypertensive response; infiltrate pin sites with local anesthetic (LA), and administer additional remifentanil (0.5–1 μg/kg) or propofol (0.5–1 mg/kg) if necessary.
- Administer IV morphine during closure of the dura, bone flap, and scalp to provide post-remifentanil analgesia.

### Intraoperative Reduction of ICP

- Maintain a straight head position and slight head elevation.
- Administer mannitol if required.
- Avoid excessive fluid administration.
- Use external ventricular drain (EVD) if necessary.
- Maintain low normal CO2 levels.
- Ensure adequate CPP through normocapnia and sufficient systolic blood pressure (SBP).
## Lundberg Waveforms

### Lundberg Waveforms

#### Lundberg A
- **Characteristics**:
  - Sustained pressure waves (50-80 mmHg)
  - Duration: Lasts 5-20 minutes before returning to baseline
- **Significance**:
  - Represents cerebral vasodilation due to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)
  - Urgent treatment needed

#### Lundberg B
- **Characteristics**:
  - High-frequency oscillations (<50 mmHg)
  - Duration: 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- **Association**:
  - Associated with normal breathing

#### Lundberg C
- **Characteristics**:
  - Small oscillations (10-20 mmHg)
  - Intracranial pressure (ICP) changes: 4-8 waves per minute
- **Significance**:
  - Reflects changes in systemic arterial pressure
  - Considered normal
