# Pain Measurement

## Introduction
- Pain is a subjective experience influenced by multiple factors, including previous pain experiences, cultural background, coping mechanisms, fear, anxiety, and depression. Consequently, the patient's perception of pain differs from nociception.
- The type and cause of acute pain influence treatment choices and responses. Acute pain can be nociceptive (somatic or visceral), neuropathic, or mixed.
- Effective acute pain management requires considering the nature of pain and its relationship to injury.

## Pain History
- A thorough pain history should include the character, intensity, location, underlying cause, associated symptoms, and current analgesic use. Additionally, it should capture the patient's ideas, concerns, and expectations regarding pain and analgesia.
- This history should be repeated after initiating treatment to monitor progress.

## Measurement
- Due to the subjective nature of pain, self-reporting is considered the most valid measurement technique.
- Various uni-dimensional scales are available for measuring acute pain, including categorical scales such as:
  - Verbal Descriptor Scale (VDS)
  - Verbal Numerical Rating Scale (VNRS)
  - Visual Analogue Scale (Was)

### Verbal Numerical Rating Scale (VNRS)
- The VNRS is widely used, employing a scale from zero to ten, where zero signifies 'no pain' and ten denotes 'the worst imaginable pain.'
- Patients score their pain using this scale, which requires no equipment and is easily repeatable. However, the patient must understand the scoring system and be able to communicate their answer.

### Visual Analogue Scale (Was)
- The Was is similar to the VNRS, using a 10 cm line with descriptors such as 'no pain' and 'worst pain imaginable' at either end.
- Patients mark the point on the line that best reflects their pain level. The distance from 'no pain' to the mark is measured in millimetres, providing a Was score of 1-100.

### Verbal Descriptor Scale (VDS)
- The VDS is a simple and quick scale that uses descriptive words to rate pain severity. For example, a four-point scale might include 'no pain,' 'mild pain,' 'moderate pain,' and 'severe pain.'

## Assessment of Functional Pain
- Pain assessment should ideally include evaluating the patient during activity. The nature of the activity varies depending on the patient's circumstances and pre-existing disability.
- The Functional Activity Score (FAS) categorizes pain-induced impairment into three categories:
  - A–no limitation
  - B–mild limitation
  - C–significant limitation
- The score is activity-specific, with appropriate activities identified and scored for each patient. Examples include deep inspiration for a patient after upper abdominal surgery or walking for a patient following lower limb joint replacement.
