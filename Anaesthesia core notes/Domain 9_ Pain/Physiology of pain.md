# Pain
## Definitions

### Pain
- Pain is an unpleasant sensory and/or emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.
### Nociceptive Pain
- Pain that arises from actual or threatened damage to non-neural tissue due to activation of nociceptors.
- Often described as 'burning.'
### Neuropathic Pain
- Pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system.
- Specific features include descriptions of 'tingling,' 'shooting,' or 'electric shock.'
- Positive findings such as allodynia (a stimulus that normally does not provoke pain) or hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain) and negative findings such as weakness or numbness support the diagnosis.
### Sensitization
- Increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons to their normal input, and/or recruitment of a response to normally subthreshold inputs.
### Central Sensitization
- Increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system to their normal or subthreshold afferent input.
### Peripheral Sensitization
- Increased responsiveness and reduced threshold of nociceptive neurons in the periphery to the stimulation of their receptive fields.
### Chronic Pain
- Pain that persists after removal of the stimulus and beyond the normal recovery period.
- Some believe that pain should be present for at least 3 months to be considered 'chronic,' although most examiners should accept the definition above.
### Nociception
- The sensation of a noxious stimulus occurring within the brain.
### Nociceptive Pain
- Pain occurring due to stimulation of peripheral sensory fibers that respond to potentially harmful stimuli (nociceptors).
- Nociceptors may respond to a single harmful stimulus such as a mechanical, chemical, or thermal stimulus, or they may respond to a combination of these (polymodal nociceptors).
- Nociceptive pain is classified into **visceral** and **somatic** based on the location of the receptors.
#### Somatic Pain
- Pain occurring due to stimulation of peripheral sensory fibers that respond to potentially harmful stimuli (nociceptors).
- Relatively well-localized pain due to activation of peripheral nociceptors.
- May be divided into superficial or deep based on the location of the structures affected (e.g., fracture pain is deep somatic pain, burn is superficial).
#### Visceral Pain
- Diffuse pain that may be difficult to localize or referred to a superficial structure distant from the source of pain.
### Allodynia
- Perception of a non-painful stimulus as painful, possibly due to reorganization of spinal cord circuitry (exchanging interneurons between nociceptors and mechanoreceptors).
- Features in neuropathic pain and serves no known useful purpose.
### Primary Hyperalgesia
- Damaged tissues have a greater sensitivity to pain than normal tissues due to Substance P, bradykinin, and histamine, which sensitize nociceptors and decrease their threshold potential.
### Secondary Hyperalgesia
- Tissues surrounding damaged tissues have a greater sensitivity to pain due to sensitization of neighboring second-order neurons by Substance P, Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), and glutamate (initially released by the second-order neurons corresponding to the damaged tissue).
### Referred Pain
- The brain perceives pain originating from an area other than the site of the painful stimulus.
- Visceral pain → C-fibres (only) → travel to spinal cord dorsal horn substantia gelatinosa → synapse with second-order neurons ← same site that cutaneous nociceptors synapse at → brain perceives visceral pain as originating from cutaneous nociceptor (e.g., MI pain referred to the left arm, pancreatic pain to the back, appendicitis to the umbilicus, diaphragm to the shoulder tip).
## Central Sensitization
- Increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system to their normal or subthreshold afferent input.
- Ongoing peripheral inflammation and nerve injury.
- Involves glutamate and multiple ion channel changes, including:
  - Spontaneous peripheral ectopic generation of action potentials.
  - Structural changes of synaptic function.
  - Sprouting of central neurons.
  - Apoptosis of inhibitory interneurons.
  - Activation of microglia, releasing trophic factors, neurotransmitters, and cytokines.
### Central Sensitization Produces Abnormal Pain Signaling
- **After nerve injury**, increased input to the dorsal horn can induce central sensitization.
  - **Nerve dysfunction** leads to increased release of pain neurotransmitters glutamate and substance P.
  - **Minimal stimuli** can lead to **increased pain perception**.
  - **Perceived pain** involves:
	- Ascending input.
	- Descending modulation.
	- Pain amplification (hyperalgesia/allodynia).
- The central nervous system (e.g., dorsal horn) exhibits:
  - Spontaneous activity.
  - Reduced threshold for activation.
  - Increased response.
  - Enlargement of the receptive field.
  - Pain memory (outlasts the triggering event).
  - Progressive increases in the response to repeated innocuous stimuli (temporal wind-up).
### Features of Central Sensitization
- Nociceptive neurons are converted to wide dynamic range neurons that respond to noxious and non-noxious stimuli.
- NMDA receptor activation leads to heightened sensitivity to circulating catecholamines.
- Increased membrane excitability, synaptic efficacy, and reduced inhibition.
- Apoptosis of inhibitory interneurons.
- Sprouting of central neurons.

# Pain Pathway

## Overview
- Pain transmission from peripheral nerves to the cerebral cortex involves three levels of neuronal involvement, with modulation at two points during the course to the cerebral cortex.
- Descending inhibitory pathways arise in the midbrain and pass to the dorsal horn.
- Multiple neurotransmitters are involved, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), noradrenaline, and opioids.
## Neuronal Pathway of Pain

### Peripheral Nerve Fibres
- **Aδ fibres** and **C fibres** transmit nociceptive signals to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord via the dorsal root ganglion.
### Dorsal Horn of Spinal Cord
- **Aδ fibres**: Synapse in Laminae I & V
- **C fibres**: Synapse in Laminae II & III (substantia gelatinosa)
- Signals ascend via the lateral spinothalamic tract to the **thalamus** (midbrain).
### Thalamus (Midbrain)
- Ventral posterior and medial nuclei are involved.
- Collaterals project to the periaqueductal gray and locus ceruleus.
- Sensory relay to the **contralateral cortex** includes:
  - Somatosensory area I (postcentral gyrus)
  - Somatosensory area II (sylvian fissure)
### Modulation
- **Descending pathways** originate from the thalamus.
- **Gate control theory** involves modulation at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
## Neuronal Connections

### Sensory Transmission
- **Aβ fibres**: Stimulate inhibitory interneurons in the substantia gelatinosa (SG), preventing nociceptive transmission to the CNS.
- **C fibres**: Inhibit inhibitory interneurons, enhancing nociceptive transmission.
- Both fibre types stimulate the second-order neuron (2°) directly, with interneurons modifying transmission.
## Transmission of Pain

**Relays Nociceptive Action Potential to Somatosensory Cortex**
- **Nociceptors** are free unmyelinated nerve endings generating action potentials in response to stimuli from cellular damage (e.g., K⁺, histamine, bradykinin, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, serotonin).
- **Fast Aδ fibres**: Sharp, well-localized response to mechanical/thermal stimuli.
- **Slow C fibres**: Dull, poorly localized response to mechanical/thermal/chemical stimuli.
- **Substantia gelatinosa** (Rexed Lamina II) or **Nucleus Proprius** (Rexed Lamina III, IV, V).
## Descending Inhibition of Pain
- Neurons from the periaqueductal grey matter travel through the Raphe Nuclei in the medulla to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where they inhibit neurotransmission between the 1st and 2nd Order Neurons using norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin.
- Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and α₂ agonists produce analgesia by augmenting this pathway.

## Gate-Control Theory

### Overview

- **Origin**: Proposed by Melzack and Wall.
- **Concept**: The transmission of a peripheral painful stimulus to the CNS occurs via a 'gate' at the spinal cord level.
### Mechanism

- **Location**: The gate is located in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord.
- **Components**:
	- **Inhibitory Interneuron**: Plays a crucial role in modulating pain signals.
- **Function**:
	- The inhibitory interneuron can be either stimulated or inhibited by different afferent inputs.
	- When the inhibitory interneuron is stimulated, it reduces the transmission of pain signals to the CNS.
	- When the inhibitory interneuron is inhibited, it allows pain signals to pass through more readily, increasing the perception of pain.
### Implications

- The gate-control theory suggests that the experience of pain is not solely determined by the intensity of the painful stimulus but is also modulated by other sensory and cognitive inputs.
- This theory provides a framework for understanding how non-painful stimuli, such as touch or pressure, can reduce pain perception (e.g., rubbing a sore area can alleviate pain).

## Consequences of Uncontrolled Pain

### Central Nervous System
- Agitation, fighting ventilation
- Disturbed sleep quality
### Cardiovascular
- Tachycardia
- Increased systemic vascular resistance and BP
- Increased myocardial oxygen demand
- Increased platelet aggregation and hypercoagulable state
### Pulmonary
- Hypoventilation
- Decreased ability to cough
- Atelectasis
- Pneumonia
- Hypoxia
- Hypercarbia
### Endocrine
- Altered release of multiple hormones (ACTH, catecholamines, aldosterone, insulin)
- Metabolic disturbances
- Water retention

## Drug Considerations

### Fentanyl
- Metabolized in the liver with no active metabolites, making it safe in renal failure.
### Morphine
- Morphine metabolites M3G and M6G are both cleared renally and can accumulate in renal failure.
  - M3G causes non-opioid mediated agitation and convulsions.
  - M6G is 2-8 times more potent than morphine.
  - Altered protein binding due to malignancy, renal, or hepatic failure may affect pharmacokinetics.
  - Pharmacokinetics in dialysis are poorly understood.
## Options for Pain Management
1. **IV Opioids**
2. **Non-opioid Analgesics**
   - Paracetamol
   - Ketamine infusions
   - Lignocaine infusions
   - Clonidine/Dexmedetomidine
3. **Gabapentinoids**
   - For neuropathic pain
4. **Regional/Neuraxial Techniques**
   - Consider coagulation and consciousness
5. **Non-pharmacological**
   - Talk therapy
   - TENS
   - Acupuncture
## Dorsal Column Stimulator
### Mechanism of Action
- Spinal cord stimulation involves electrical activation of the large diameter afferents of the dorsal columns or dorsal roots, inhibiting nociceptive small diameter afferent transmission rostrally (gate theory). SCS also has anti-ischemic effects.

### Anaesthesia Considerations
- Avoid unipolar diathermy
- Avoid neuraxial techniques to prevent device damage
- Avoid MRI
- SCS is contraindicated with pacemakers
- No evidence for routine antibiotics
# Acute Pain

- Physical, thermal, or chemical stimuli initiate a cascade of events leading to predictable physiological, psychological, and behavioral responses.
- Nociceptive signals cause significant changes within the peripheral nervous system in response to injury, extending to the spinal cord, higher brain centers, and remote organ systems through neuro-humeral and endocrine responses.
- Acute pain is detected in the peripheral nervous system by specialized primary nerve fibers called nociceptors.
- These nerve endings transduce physical and chemical stimuli logarithmically, depending on the intensity of the stimulus. Once a threshold is reached, an action potential travels along a peripheral nerve, through the sensory cell bodies of the dorsal root ganglion, into the spinal cord, and ascends to the brain.
- The perception of acute pain is not always directly proportional to the degree of tissue damage, as pain has strong sensory and emotional components that interact to produce an overall 'pain experience.'
## Nociceptors and Nerve Fibers
- Acute pain perception begins with the activation of specific sensory nerves, termed nociceptors.
- These unencapsulated free nerve endings are present in the skin, deep somatic tissue, and viscera. High-threshold nociceptors can activate without actual tissue damage if the stimulus is sufficiently intense. Nociceptors are likely activated by mechanical distortion of the nerve, leading to increased H+ and K+ concentrations.
- Nociceptors are divided into two main classes: A-delta and C fibers.

| Type     | Conduction  | Myelination | Sensation        | Receptors            |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| A-delta  | 10-40 ms^-1 | Yes         | Sharp, immediate | High & low threshold |
| A-beta   | > 40 ms^-1  | Yes         | Light touch      | Low threshold        |
| C-fibers | < 2 ms^-1   | No          | Dull, aching     | High threshold       |

- In contrast to A-delta and C-fibers, A-beta fibers respond to light tactile and noxious stimuli but do not increase their firing rate with increased stimulus intensity, thus not encoding noxious stimuli.

### Sodium Channels
- Sodium channel activation underpins the initiation of an action potential and ultimately the perception of acute pain. Voltage-gated sodium channels are the site of action for local anesthetics, highlighting their crucial role in pain signaling and clinical importance.
## Peripheral Sensitization
- Any injury to body tissue releases various chemical mediators and immune cells, resulting in acute pain and inflammation.
- Initially, phospholipase A2 acts on membrane lipids to synthesize arachidonic acid. Cyclo-oxygenase then converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, directly lowering the activation threshold for A-delta and C-fibers. Inflammatory mediators such as histamine, bradykinin, and leukotrienes are released alongside prostaglandins, collectively forming the 'inflammatory soup' that surrounds peripheral nociceptors, reducing their membrane threshold and activating dormant receptors.
- Sensitized receptors exhibit an increased basal rate of discharge and a supra-normal increase in discharge strength in response to any stimulus, clinically demonstrated as hyperalgesia extending beyond a surgical incision.
- Hypersensitivity is also mediated by the Capsaicin/vanilloid receptor TRPV-1, activated by heat and acidic pH in inflamed or infected tissue, enhancing pain sensitivity.
- Other molecules within nociceptors, such as substance P and Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), also enhance pain transmission. Substance P activates second-order neurons to send a 'pain' signal to the brain, while CGRP causes vasodilation, contributing to neurogenic inflammation.
## Central Sensitization
- Nociceptive signals from peripheral nerves are conveyed from afferent fibers through the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to the thalamus, limbic, and cortical areas, leading to the perception of acute pain, withdrawal reflexes, and behavioral responses.
- Significant modulation of afferent nociceptive signals occurs within the spinal cord, either enhancing or attenuating the signal. Like the peripheral nervous system (PNS), nociceptive input can alter the central nervous system (CNS) to respond exaggeratedly, such that even innocuous stimuli may be painful, termed central sensitization.
  - Central sensitization involves the N-methyl, D-adenine (NMDA) receptor, prominent in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). In response to afferent signals, glutamate binds to the NMDA receptor, causing calcium and potassium influx, nerve depolarization, and heightened sensitivity to neurotransmitters.
  - At the molecular level, nociception induces alterations in second-order neurons, such as phosphorylation of NMDA and AMPA receptors, contributing to central sensitization.
- Normally, these physiological responses to injury should revert to the pre-injury state after some time, typically before complete healing. However, in some patients, the nervous system remains sensitized even after tissue healing, potentially leading to chronic pain. The severity of acute postoperative pain is linked to the development of chronic pain, possibly due to failures in endogenous analgesic pathways resetting the CNS.
# Neuro-anatomy
## Spinal Cord
### Dorsal Horn Neurons
- Cell bodies of afferent nerves lie in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) with fibers synapsing in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The output from the dorsal horn is dependent on other neuronal input to the synapse. Afferent neurons may divide prior to entering the cord and send branches cephalad or caudad in the longitudinal tract of Lissauer before synapsing with dorsal horn neurons.
- As a result, a single C-fiber afferent may be responsible for innervating dorsal horn neurons at multiple spinal levels.
### Wide Dynamic Range Neurons
- Neurons in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th layers of the spinal cord can respond to noxious input as well as light touch.
- These neurons are termed wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons. They exhibit important properties such as 'wind-up' and 'convergence.'
- Wind-up refers to the state where neuronal output increases in response to continuous, low-frequency input. Convergence describes how somatic and visceral afferents converge on the same neuron.
- Convergence explains the phenomenon of referred pain, where visceral pain is experienced in body parts remote from the primary site of pain but are supplied by the same dorsal horn neuron.
## Rexed Laminae and Ascending Tracts
- The gray matter of the spinal cord is divided into ten physiologically and histologically distinct layers known as Rexed laminae.
- Laminae 1 to 6 and 10 are sites where sensory nerves synapse with dorsal horn cells and are crucial in pain transmission.
- Laminae 7-9 are involved in motor function.
### Lamina 1
- Known as the marginal layer. Cells here respond almost exclusively to noxious stimuli and send axons to the spinothalamic tract or parabrachial nucleus.
### Lamina 2
- Also known as the substantia gelatinosa.
- Cells in lamina 2 receive afferent input directly from small-diameter fibers and synapse with many interneurons.
- Cells in lamina 2 exhibit significant cross-linking with cells in lamina 1 and 5, modulating their function.
### Laminae 3 and 4
- These laminae respond only to innocuous stimuli.
### Lamina 5
- Cells in lamina 5 receive input from large and small diameter afferent fibers from all superficial and deep structures.
- They respond to both noxious and innocuous stimuli and receive signals from a large area of the body, hence termed wide-dynamic range cells.
- Following a nociceptive impulse traversing and undergoing modulation in the spinal cord, the signals ascend in various tracts.
## Ascending Tracts
### Spinothalamic Tract
- Cells of the spinothalamic tract (STT) originate in laminae 1, 4, and 5 of the spinal cord, cross the cord at the anterior commissure, and ascend in the contralateral anterolateral quadrant.
- This tract is divided during cordotomy for the treatment of intractable cancer pain.
### Spinoreticular Tract
- Located in the anterolateral quadrant of the spinal cord.
- Axons from the spinoreticular tract (SRT) interact with neurons involved in descending pain modulation, potentially explaining the phenomenon of counterirritation, where one type of pain reduces the severity of another, as in 'rubbing it better.'
### Spinomesencephalic Tract
- This tract supplies sensory input to the superior colliculus and periaqueductal gray (PAG).
- The PAG is involved in autonomic and somatomotor reactions to pain, while the superior colliculus is involved in the integration, orientation, and behavioral response to pain.
