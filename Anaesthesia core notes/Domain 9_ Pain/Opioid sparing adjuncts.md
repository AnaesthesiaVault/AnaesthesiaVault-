### Encourages Postoperative DREAMS

**DREAMS**: Drinking, Eating, Analgesia, Mobilizing, and Sleeping
## Rescue Plan for Suboptimal Analgesia

### Step 1: Perform Focused H&P

- Preoperative analgesia use
- Preoperative pain baseline
- Postoperative exam
- Determine location & etiology of pain

### Step 2: Assess Pain Severity

- Assess location, severity, duration, and aggravating factors
- Limitations due to pain (e.g., drinking, eating, mobilizing, sleeping)
- Any adverse drug events due to current pain regimen

### Step 3: Determine Pain Type

- Determine pain type: neuropathic, inflammatory, visceral, or somatic in nature
- Consider multiple pain generators
- Exclude surgical/medical complications

### Step 4: Administer Rescue Treatment

- Confirm use of appropriate non-opioid options from Treatment Algorithm, including tramadol
- Add opioid if tolerated, IV if needed (e.g., hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, hydromorphone)
## Risk Factors for Persistent Postoperative Opioid Use

- Preoperative Opioid Use
- History of Psychiatric Disorder
- History of Substance Use Disorder
- Presence of Preoperative Pain Conditions
- History of Smoking
- Type of Surgery:
	- Total Knee Arthroplasty
	- Thoracotomy—Open or Video-Assisted
	- Breast Surgery
	- Spine Surgery
	- Craniotomy
## Why not Opioids
- PONV
- POCD
- Sedation
- Ileus
- Hyperalgesia
- Antanalgesia
- Respiratory depression
- Prolonged hospital stay
- Cancer recurrence
### Opioid Mechanism of Action

- **Opioid-induced Antinociception:**
	- Opioids bind to receptors in the brainstem and spinal cord
	- Decrease arousal by blocking cholinergic arousal projections
- **Key Neurotransmitters and Pathways:**
	- Excitatory and inhibitory effects on thalamus and cortex
	- Acetylcholine (ACh), Glutamate (Glu), Norepinephrine (NE)

# Multimodal Approach

## Physiology
### Nociception Pathways

#### Ascending Pathway

- Nociceptive signals enter the spinal cord through nociceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglia
- Synapse in the dorsal horn and travel in the anterolateral fasciculus to the NTS and amygdala, then to the thalamus
- Thalamus projects to the primary sensory cortex

#### Descending Pathway

- Begins in the sensory cortex, projects to hypothalamus and amygdala
- Further projects to PAG, NTS, and RVM
- Modulates incoming nociceptive information at the level of the dorsal horn
## Basic Components of Multimodal Analgesic Regimens

### Neuraxial

- Intrathecal
- Epidural

### Peripheral Nerve Block

- Peripheral Nerve Blocks
- Transversus Abdominis Plane Block
- Paravertebral Block

### Local Infiltration

- Intra-articular
- Incisional

### Systemic

- Acetaminophen
- NSAIDs/COX-2 Selective
- Gabapentinoids
- Ketamine
- Lidocaine
- α2 Agonists
- Magnesium
- Dexamethasone
- Tramadol
- Opioids
## Regional and Neuraxial
### Epidurals

- Compared with parenteral opioid-based analgesia, thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is associated with superior postoperative pain control, reduced pulmonary morbidity, and earlier return of bowel function for open abdominal surgery.
- To ensure that TEA does not prolong the length of stay, it is prudent to plan to wean the infusion and remove the catheter within 2 to 4 days after surgery, depending on the typical recovery timeline (e.g., colorectal surgery vs. Whipple). Supplement with oral, non-opioid multimodal agents as soon as possible in the postoperative period.
- Investigations are ongoing to determine whether TEA can be supplanted by other regional techniques, such as rectus sheath catheters (RSCs).
- Recent meta-analyses have reported TEA failure rates as high as 30% in some centers and approximately 20% of patients experience postoperative hypotension, a complication increasingly associated with acute kidney and myocardial injury.
#### Neuraxial and Regional Blocks Adjuncts

##### Intrathecal

- **Clonidine:** 15-75 mcg
- **Dexmedetomidine:** 5 mcg
- **Dexamethasone:** 4-8 mg
- **Epinephrine:** 100-200 mcg

##### Epidural

- **Clonidine:** 1-2 mcg/kg
- **Dexmedetomidine:** 1 mcg/kg
- **Dexamethasone:** 4-10 mg
- **Epinephrine:** 1-5 mcg/mL

##### Perineural

- **Clonidine:** 150-300 mcg
- **Dexmedetomidine:** 50-60 mcg
- **Dexamethasone:** 4 mg
- **Epinephrine:** 100-300 mcg

**Note:** Studies performed with methadone versus other opioids have typically used doses of 10-20 mg IV, but some have gone as high as 0.3 mg/kg. Lower doses of opioids may be needed if other adjuncts are used. Lower doses of methadone are also noted to have pharmacokinetics/dynamics similar to hydromorphone rather than what is achieved with higher doses of methadone and longer half-lives.

### Spinal

- **Intrathecal Opioid Duration:** 24-48 hours.
- **Local Anesthetic Duration:** 6-8 hours, providing dense analgesia in the operative and immediate postoperative period.
- Dense blocks at the time of surgical insult may provide additional benefits by partially blocking the stress response associated with these operations.
- **Dose Range for Intrathecal Morphine:** 100-4000 mcg, with current practice tending toward lower doses (<0.3 mg) due to dose-dependent side effects and respiratory depression.
  - Lower doses (<300 mcg) are more commonly used due to fewer side effects.
  - Recent meta-analyses replicate findings that only intrathecal morphine doses greater than 500 mcg show these trends.
- Some centers use a spinal dose of bupivacaine as a carrier for the opioid to manage pain and stimulation from the incision in the immediate perioperative period. This often results in a sympathetic block that requires management of hypotension intraoperatively, which is typically not severe.
- Hybrid techniques, where intrathecal opioids provide visceral analgesia and truncal blocks (with or without continuous infusion catheters) manage somatic pain, are associated with significantly lower pain scores and reduced opioid requirements.

### Regional Anesthesia

- **TAP Blocks with Liposomal Bupivacaine:** Shown to reduce pain scores and opioid use for 24-36 hours.
- **Preoperative vs. Postoperative TAP Block Administration:** Preoperative administration appears to have greater effects on early pain and opioid consumption compared with postoperative administration.
- **Meta-analyses:** Indicate that truncal blocks for abdominal surgical procedures are associated with superior analgesia and decreased postoperative opioid consumption compared with opioid analgesia alone.
### Continuous Wound Infiltration Catheter

- **Continuous Wound Infiltration Catheters (CWICs):**
	- Offer sustained postoperative analgesia through wound infiltration analgesia using specially designed wound soaker catheters.
	- Simpler compared to rectus sheath catheters (RSCs) for two main reasons:
		- The surgeon can place CWICs into the length of the wound in the preperitoneal space before closing.
		- CWICs can be used in any wound orientation, unlike RSCs, which are limited to midline incisions only.
	- **Rectus Sheath Catheters (RSCs):**
		- RSCs have been shown to be superior to CWICs for midline incisions in at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT).

### Paracetamol

#### Mechanism of Action
- The analgesic effect of paracetamol (acetaminophen) is primarily mediated through inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway.

#### Efficacy
- A single dose of acetaminophen has been shown to provide 50% pain relief for four hours in about half of patients experiencing moderate-to-severe acute postoperative pain.
- When used in conjunction with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen can have an additive or even synergistic analgesic effect.

#### Intravenous vs. Oral Administration
- **Intravenous Acetaminophen:**
  - Associated with more favorable pharmacokinetics, including faster onset and higher plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels compared to oral and rectal acetaminophen.
  - Does not provide a clear benefit regarding analgesic efficacy and patient outcomes over oral administration.
  - Preventive use (given early):
	- 15 mg/kg of IV acetaminophen administered 10 to 30 minutes before induction/incision (compared to the same dose given 10–30 minutes before the end of surgery/skin closure) was associated with reduced 24-hour opioid consumption and a lower incidence of postoperative vomiting.
- **Oral Acetaminophen:**
  - Generally preferred in patients able to tolerate oral intake.
  - Preoperative oral administration (30 to 60 minutes before surgery) is effective and does not show a clear benefit over IV formulation for patients able to take oral medications.

#### Clinical Benefits
- Associated with significantly lower early pain at rest and during movement.
- Reduces postoperative opioid consumption and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared to placebo.
### NSAIDS

Surgical insults induce rupture of cell membranes, leading to the release of arachidonic acid, which, through the action of COX-1 and COX-2, is converted into prostaglandins, which are potent inflammatory and nociceptive mediators. NSAIDs modulate the nociceptive response by blocking the actions of COX-1 and COX-2, and lidocaine exerts their nociceptive effects by inactivating sodium channels, thus inhibiting excitation of nerve endings and blocking conduction of action potentials in peripheral nerves. Lidocaine also impedes neutrophil degranulation, thereby impeding the amplification of the inflammatory response.

#### Arachidonic Acid Pathway

![](Pasted%20image%2020240430142624.png)

### COX-1 and COX-2

#### COX-1
- **Expression:** Constitutively expressed in most tissues.
- **Function:** Involved in the production of prostaglandins (PGI2, PGE2) and thromboxane A2.
  - **Gastric Mucosal Protection**
  - **Maintenance of Renal Perfusion**
  - **Platelet Aggregation**

#### COX-2
- **Expression:** Inducible enzyme, primarily involved in inflammation.
  
#### Non-Selective COX Inhibitors
##### Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid)
- **Mechanism of Action:**
  - Irreversibly inhibits COX-1.
  - Modifies COX-2 action.
- **Uses:**
  - Anti-inflammatory
  - Antipyretic
  - Antiplatelet (prophylaxis against myocardial infarction)
- **Mechanism:**
  - Irreversible inhibition of platelet COX-1, thus inhibiting platelet thromboxane A2.
  - As platelets lack a nucleus, they cannot synthesize new COX-1.
- **Side Effects:**
  - Gastrointestinal ulceration
  - Renal dysfunction
  - Platelet inhibition
  - Aspirin-induced asthma
- **Risk Factors for Side Effects:**
  - Age
  - Duration of therapy
  - Stress
  - Hypovolemia
  - Decreased renal perfusion
  - Concomitant administration of other nephrotoxic drugs.

#### Selective COX-2 Inhibitors
- **Selectivity:** Higher selectivity for COX-2 but still inhibit COX-1 to some degree.
- **Examples:**
  - **Meloxicam:** 3 times greater selectivity for COX-2.
  - **Celecoxib:** 325 times higher selectivity for COX-2.
- **Advantages:**
  - Superior side-effect profile regarding gastrointestinal ulceration and platelet function.
- **Risks:**
  - Increased risk of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular incidents, leading to the withdrawal of Rofecoxib (Vioxx®) and Valdecoxib (Bextra®).
- **Proposed Mechanisms for Cardiovascular Risks:**
  - Prostacyclin/thromboxane imbalance affecting the platelet-endothelial interface.
  - Effects of COX-2 derived prostaglandins on myocardial preconditioning.
  - Effects on renal blood flow and systemic blood pressure.
- **Clinical Evidence:**
  - No strong clinical evidence supports the prostacyclin/thromboxane imbalance hypothesis.
  - Addition of low-dose aspirin to COX-2 inhibitors has not resolved increased cardiovascular risk.
  - Non-selective NSAIDs like diclofenac and nabumetone have similar cardiovascular risks as COX-2 inhibitors.
- **Effects on Bone Healing:**
  - Conventional NSAIDs can delay long bone fracture repair and spinal fusion in experimental animals and negatively impact spinal fusion rates in humans.
  - Controversial evidence regarding selective NSAIDs and bone repair.
- **Contraindications for Coxib Use:**
  - Ischaemic heart disease
  - Cerebrovascular disease
  - Peripheral arterial disease
  - Moderate or severe heart failure

#### COX-2 and Colorectal Cancer
- **Colorectal Cancer:** The third most prevalent cancer in developing nations.
- **COX-2 Overexpression:** Common in colorectal cancer patients.
- **Clinical Trial:**
  - A large multicentre trial involving 32 countries showed that Celecoxib significantly reduced the risk of colorectal adenomas.
#### Side Effects of NSAIDs and COX-2 Inhibitors

##### Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding and Ulceration
- Ranges from mild pain to iron deficiency anemia to fatal bleeding.

##### Thrombotic Events
- Increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.

##### Renal Impairment
- Renally produced prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGI2) maintain adequate renal perfusion when circulating vasoconstrictors such as renin, angiotensin, and noradrenaline are high.
- Prolonged use of NSAIDs may result in nephropathy, leading to papillary necrosis and interstitial fibrosis.

##### Fluid Retention
- May precipitate heart failure and exacerbate hypertension.

##### Exacerbation of Asthma
- Up to 20% of asthmatics may experience exacerbation due to increased production of leukotrienes causing bronchospasm.

##### Inhibition of Platelet Aggregation and Vasoconstriction
- Non-selective NSAIDs may contribute to increased perioperative blood loss.
- COX-2 inhibitors have no effect on platelet function.

##### Drug Interactions
- **Lithium:** Serum levels may be increased; monitor levels.
- **Warfarin:** May be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites, necessitating monitoring of levels.

##### Hepatotoxicity
- Usually occurs after prolonged or excessive use of NSAIDs.
- Up to 15% may experience a rise in serum transaminase levels, even following short courses.

#### Evidence

- A systematic review noted that preoperative COX-2 inhibitors significantly reduced postoperative pain, analgesic consumption, and antiemetic use, and improved patient satisfaction compared with preoperative placebo.
- There is impressive synergy with opioids, showing a 20-30% reduction in opioid use.
- Caution is advised in cases of hypovolemia and concerns for anastomotic leak.
- NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration, bleeding, and renal impairment.
- COX-2 inhibitors can increase the risk of cardiovascular adverse events and are typically avoided after cardiac surgery.
- Insufficient evidence exists to recommend against the routine use of NSAIDs, especially COX-2 inhibitors, for bone malunion and anastomotic leak. These medications are effective in treating pain and reducing opioid use in the perioperative period.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Produce analgesia through inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels.
- **Common Drugs:** Gabapentin and pregabalin.
	- Shown to reduce pain scores and opioid use in meta-analyses.
	- Single preoperative doses are associated with a decrease in postoperative pain and opioid consumption at 24 hours.
- **Benefits:**
	- Reduce acute postoperative pain.
	- Reduce opioid consumption.
	- Reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).
- **Side Effects:**
	- Dizziness
	- Visual disturbances
	- Respiratory depression
- **Cautions:**
	- Use with caution in the elderly.
	- Use with caution in patients with renal dysfunction.
- **Preoperative Dose:** 300–1200 mg.
- **Evidence:** Suggests that gabapentinoids may reduce opioid consumption in the perioperative period but may increase the incidence of certain side effects, particularly in the elderly.

### NMDA Receptor Antagonists

#### Ketamine

- **Mechanism of Action:** Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that antagonizes N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the brain and spinal cord, reducing the transmission of pain signals. It blocks GABAergic interneurons at low doses.
- **Benefits:**
	- Significant reductions in pain.
	- Reduced opioid consumption.
	- Reduced PONV.
	- Particularly beneficial for patients on chronic opioid use.
- **Dosing:**
	- **Intraoperative Boluses:** 0.15-1 mg/kg.
	- **Perioperative Infusions:** 1 to 5 mg/kg/min, with a postoperative infusion rate of 2.5 mcg/kg/min.
- **Evidence:** Ketamine is effective in reducing postoperative pain and opioid requirements without significant side effects.

#### Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4)

- **Mechanism of Action:** May reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption through the blockade of glutamatergic receptors in the spinal cord and brainstem arousal projections.
- **Benefits:**
	- Reduced postoperative morphine consumption by 30% in scoliosis surgery.
	- Improved sleep and satisfaction scores.
- **Dosing:**
	- **Typical Boluses:** 30–50 mg/kg.
	- **Infusion Rates:** 4 to 15 mg/kg/h.
- **Side Effects:**
	- Respiratory muscle weakness.
	- Potentiation of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers.
- **Evidence:** No clinical toxicity related to toxic serum levels of magnesium reported in systematic reviews.
- **Animal Studies:** Median lethal dose in rats is over 150 mg/kg as a bolus and greater than 200 mg/kg/h as an infusion.
### Lidocaine

#### Intravenous Lidocaine Infusions
- **Effectiveness:**
  - IV lidocaine infusions reduce systemic inflammation and are indicated as part of a multimodal analgesic approach for visceral surgery when other local anesthetic approaches, such as regional analgesia, are not possible.
  - In open and laparoscopic abdominal surgery, IV lidocaine infusions have been shown to significantly reduce postoperative pain intensity at rest, with cough, and movement, as well as opioid consumption for up to 48 hours postoperative.
  - Associated with earlier return of bowel function and shorter length of hospital stay.

#### Mechanism of Action
- Lidocaine has a multimodal mechanism of action. At therapeutic concentrations during IV infusion, it blocks muscarinic (M1, M3) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.
- At higher and near-toxic concentrations, it affects multiple receptor types, including Nav1.8/1.7, purinoceptor 7 (P2X7), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5HT-3), nicotinic cholinergic receptors, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), and acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC).

#### Benefits
- Analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antihyperalgesic effects.
- Reduces sensitivity and activity of spinal cord neurons (central sensitization) and decreases NMDA receptor-mediated post-synaptic depolarization.
- Clinically relevant decrease in systemic inflammatory markers in patients receiving lidocaine perioperatively.

#### Dosing
- **Loading Dose:** No more than 1.5 mg/kg, given as an infusion over 10 minutes.
- **Maintenance Infusion:** No more than 1.5 mg/kg/h for no longer than 24 hours, subject to review and reassessment. Typically results in plasma concentrations < 5 μg/ml.
- Ideal body weight should be used for dose calculation (Ideal body weight = (height in cm - 100) for men; (height in cm - 105) for women).
- IV lidocaine should not be used in patients weighing < 40 kg or exceed 120 mg/h.
- IV lidocaine should not be used concurrently with other local anesthetic interventions or within their period of action.
  - No nerve or fascial plane blocks should be performed until 4 hours after completion of an IV lidocaine infusion.
  - Boluses of local anesthetic must not be given into wound or epidural catheters until 4 hours after an IV lidocaine infusion.
  - Infusions (without boluses) through wound or epidural catheters may start 30 minutes after stopping an IV lidocaine infusion.
  - Topical 5% lidocaine medicated plasters should be removed before starting an IV lidocaine infusion.
  - Single-shot spinal blockade does not pose a problem given the small dose of local anesthetic used; intrathecal opioids can be used in conjunction with IV lidocaine.
  - Concurrent administration of ketamine is acceptable.

#### Pharmacokinetics
- Linear and predictable only up to 12 hours, leading to recommendations to reduce the rate of lidocaine infusion to approximately 50% after 24 hours, even in patients without cardiac and hepatic failure.

#### Dose Reductions
- Necessary in patients with liver failure, renal failure, hypoalbuminemia, acidosis, or those using beta blockers, amiodarone (reduce metabolism), or CYP450 inhibitors.

#### Side Effects
- More pronounced in patients with liver dysfunction, pulmonary diseases (carbon dioxide retention), and congestive heart failure.
- Common side effects include drowsiness, light-headedness, peri-oral numbness, tinnitus, and bradycardia.

#### Contraindications
- Cardiac disease
- Electrolyte disorders
- Seizure disorders
- Renal or hepatic impairment
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding
- Neurological disorders

#### Toxicity
- Early studies investigating lidocaine toxicity infused IV lidocaine at a rate of 30 mg/kg/h, significantly higher than modern regimens.
- Blood levels associated with serious toxicity are about 9–10 μg/ml; to avoid toxic effects (central nervous system depression, convulsions, and hypotension), the dose should be kept < 3 mg/kg/h.
- Half-life of lidocaine is approximately 100 minutes following either a bolus or an infusion lasting < 12 hours. For infusion durations > 12 hours, lidocaine shows non-linear or time-dependent pharmacokinetics.
- Patients with hepatic or renal impairment are more susceptible to developing lidocaine toxicity.
  - Plasma clearance is reduced in liver failure; in renal failure, clearance is similar to normal subjects, but metabolites might accumulate during prolonged infusion.
- Factors influencing toxicity include acid-base status (acidaemia increases dissociation from plasma proteins), hypoxaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, and interactions with drugs reducing metabolism (e.g., beta-blockers) or clearance (e.g., amiodarone).
- Modern studies have not specifically reported adverse effects related to drug interactions.

#### Evidence

- **Meta-Analyses:** Recent meta-analyses suggest that the continued perioperative administration of IV lidocaine is associated with:
	- Decreased postoperative pain.
	- Reduced opioid consumption.
	- Possibly faster return of bowel function.
	- Decreased length of hospital stay.
- **Pain and Recovery:** A meta-analysis found that IV lidocaine is associated with:
	- Lower pain scores.
	- Reduced opioid use.
	- Faster recovery after abdominal surgery.
	- Significant reduction in postoperative pain intensity at rest, with cough, and with movement for up to 48 hours postoperatively.
	- Earlier return of bowel function, allowing for earlier recovery and shorter hospital stay.

| **Infusion Termination** | Patients may be discharged on oral medications when intravenous lidocaine infusion is terminated                                                                               | Infusion may be continued postoperatively; monitor patients' response                                                 | After 72 hours, consider reducing the infusion or replacing it with oral medications                                                                                                                           |

### Dexamethasone

#### Overview

- **Class:** Glucocorticoid steroid.
- **Use:** Part of a multimodal perioperative pain regimen due to its analgesic benefits, likely related to its anti-inflammatory properties.

#### Benefits from Single Dose

- **Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV):** Reduces incidence.
- **Analgesia:** Provides pain relief.
- **Regional Blockade:** Enhances the duration of action.
- **Sore Throat:** Reduces incidence postoperatively.
- **Discharge and Oral Intake:** Facilitates earlier discharge and earlier oral intake after tonsillectomy.

#### Concerns

- **Risk of Bleeding:**
	- No clear evidence of increased bleeding risk from a single dose of dexamethasone.
	- Caution is advised when combining dexamethasone with NSAIDs in surgical procedures with a high risk of postoperative bleeding.
- **Risk of Infection and Wound Healing:**
	- A large noninferiority trial (PADDI 2019) found no increase in surgical site infection within 30 days post-surgery with a single 8-mg dose of dexamethasone.
	- Similar results in patients with diabetes mellitus, who are at higher risk for complications related to infection and hyperglycemia.
- **Perioperative Hyperglycemia:**
	- Monitoring of capillary blood glucose hourly for at least 4 hours post-administration in diabetic patients is recommended.
	- Meta-analyses indicate a slight increase in average peak glucose concentrations by 20 mg/dL, which is unlikely to have significant clinical impact.
- **Psychiatric Disturbance:**
	- Typically seen with higher doses and prolonged therapy.
	- No reliable data on psychiatric manifestations following a single dose of dexamethasone.
- **Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Suppression:**
	- Minor effects with unknown clinical significance.
- **Gastric Ulceration:**
	- Case reports suggest the shortest duration associated with avascular necrosis is one week, with symptoms typically appearing after six months to three years of exposure.
	- The significance of a single perioperative dose is unknown.
- **Tumor Lysis Syndrome:**
	- Known lympholytic effect causing growth arrest and apoptosis in lymphocytes.
	- Case reports exist of tumor lysis syndrome following treatment with dexamethasone, typically at very high doses (e.g., 20 mg).
	- Empiric therapy with steroids is usually avoided in patients suspected of having a lymphoid malignancy.
- **Dexamethasone-Induced Perineal Irritation:**
	- Intravenous administration can lead to acute, short-lived perineal pain, irritation, burning, or tingling, possibly due to the phosphate ester in dexamethasone sodium phosphate.
	- More common in females than males.

#### Evidence from Meta-Analyses

- **Pain Relief and Opioid Use:**
	- Patients receiving dexamethasone (4–10 mg or >0.1 mg/kg) had lower pain scores, used less opioids, and required less rescue analgesia.
- **Infection and Wound Healing:**
	- No increase in infection or delayed wound healing observed.

### Alpha 2 Agonist
#### Overview

- **Mechanism of Action:**
	- Dexmedetomidine and clonidine induce antinociception primarily through enhanced inhibitory activity in the descending nociceptive pathways.
	- Sedation and loss of consciousness induced by these agents occur through norepinephrine (NE)-mediated disinhibition of the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus and decreased noradrenergic signaling in the thalamus and cortex.
	- They produce analgesia by stimulating alpha-2 receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, reducing transmission of nociceptive signals.

#### Desired Effects

- Sedation
- Hypnosis
- Anxiolysis
- Sympatholysis
- Analgesia

#### Adverse Effects

- Common adverse effects include:
	- Sedation
	- Hypotension
	- Bradycardia

#### Perioperative Benefits

- Perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine or clonidine can reduce morphine consumption for up to 24 hours, similar to the extent of acetaminophen (paracetamol), but not as much as other NSAIDs.
- Side effects such as sedation and hypotension must be considered.

#### Dosage

- **Clonidine:**
	- Typical dose ranges from 1 to 5 mcg/kg orally, IV, or perineurally.
- **Dexmedetomidine:**
	- IV bolus: 0.5 mcg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/h.
	- Perineurally: 0.5 mcg/kg.

#### Dexmedetomidine Specifics

- **Selectivity:**
	- Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist.
	- It is seven times more selective for alpha-2 receptors than clonidine, with an alpha-2

		ratio of 1600:1.

- **Analgesic Action:**
	- Produces analgesia via action at the supraspinal level in the locus coeruleus and at the spinal cord level.

### Tramadol

![](Pasted%20image%2020240430142424.png)

#### Overview

- **Caution:** Use tramadol cautiously in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery who are over 75 years, ASA 3 or 4, or have impaired mobility or frailty, as its use in these settings is associated with an increased risk of delirium.
- **Recommendation:** Consider tramadol as an analgesic adjunct based on existing evidence in colorectal surgery (CRS).

#### Mechanism of Action

- Tramadol's antinociceptive activity is mediated via two distinct mechanisms:
	1. **Mu Receptor Affinity:** Initially thought to be the primary mechanism, its affinity for the mu receptor is weak (6,000 times less than morphine).
	2. **Monoaminergic Modulation:** Inhibits 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) and noradrenaline reuptake, and stimulates presynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine release. This results in monoaminergic spinal modulation of pain through indirect activation of postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors, blocking pain impulses to the brain.

#### Pharmacology

- **Racemic Mixture:**
	- **L(+) Isomer:** Main activity at opiate receptor sites.
	- **D(-) Isomer:** Main activity at other sites.
- **Metabolism:**
	- Metabolized by cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
	- Only one of the 11 known metabolites, O-desmethyltramadol, is pharmacologically active.
	- O-desmethyltramadol is 2-4 times as potent as the parent compound, with a 200 times greater affinity for the mu receptor and an elimination half-life of 9 hours.
- **Genetic Variability:**
	- CYP3A4 deficiency occurs in 8-20% of patients.
	- CYP2D6 inhibition by quinidine can reduce tramadol's efficacy.

### Methadone

#### Overview

- Methadone has a complex pharmacologic profile and is considered beneficial in reducing postoperative opioid consumption and improving patient satisfaction.

#### Mechanism of Action

- **Opioid Receptor Activity:** Agonist activity at mu, kappa, and delta-opioid receptors.
- **NMDA Receptor Antagonism:** Functions as an antagonist at NMDA receptors.

#### Pharmacology

- **Onset and Duration:** Rapid onset with variable metabolism. The prolonged duration of action significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption.
- **Clinical Benefits:**
	- Lower pain scores.
	- Reduced opioid consumption compared with alternative opioid regimens.
	- Better patient satisfaction.
- **Role in ERPs:** The exact role and possible benefits of methadone within Enhanced Recovery Protocols (ERPs) remain to be elucidated.

**Notes:**
- The anesthetic combinations reported here are the ones that were used in these cases and are presented as examples of multimodal general anesthesia. In all 4 cases, the anesthesiologist used EEG monitoring as described in Purdon et al.
- Field blocks were prepared as described.
- Postoperative monitoring was accomplished with a single EEG lead to track the nociceptive state intraoperatively in all cases except the laminectomy, for which nociception monitoring was accomplished with bilateral leads.
- Abbreviations: EEG, electroencephalogram; MAC, age-adjusted expired minimal alveolar concentration; Was, visual analog score for pain.
- *These infusions are administered if requested by an anesthesiologist present.
- **The drugs are mixed immediately before administration.
- †Infiltration/infusion done with the assistance of an anesthesiologist present.
# ERAS for Colorectal Surgery

### Preoperative Clinics

- Setting realistic expectations and educating about the process to achieve optimal analgesia

### Holding (Day of Surgery)

- Reinforcing expectations and goals
- Continuing education about the process to achieve optimal analgesia for functional recovery

### Intraoperative

- **IV/Oral Analgesia:**
	- NSAIDs
	- Acetaminophen
	- Gabapentinoids
- **Local Anesthetic:**
	- Single-Shot: TAP, RS, SAB+/-Opioid
	- Continuous Block: Thoracic Epidural, TAP/RS Catheter, Wound Catheter
- **Other Adjuncts:**
	- Lidocaine Infusion
	- Dexamethasone
	- Ketamine Bolus/Infusion

### PACU & Postoperative Ward

- Continuing education and engagement of all team members with a unified message

### Home

- Ensure comprehensive management from preoperative to postdischarge

# Opioid Free Analgesia Example

## Premedication

- **Dexmedetomidine:** 0.25 mcg/kg (max 20 mcg) administered when monitors are applied.

## Opioid-Free Analgesia Mixture (OFA Mix)

- **Components:**
	- Dexmedetomidine 50 mcg
	- Ketamine 50 mg
	- Lignocaine (Lidocaine) 500 mg
	- Dilute to 50 mL with normal saline (0.9% NaCl)

## Induction

- **OFA Mix:** 0.1 mL/kg adjusted body weight (ABW)
- **Additional Agents:**
	- Propofol: Administer to effect
	- Rocuronium: Administer as needed
	- Dexamethasone: 10 mg (if not given before induction)
	- Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4): 40 mg/kg ABW

## Maintenance

- **OFA Mix Infusion:** 0.1 mL/kg ABW/hr
- **Propofol or Volatile Agent:** Administer as required for anesthesia maintenance.

## Intraoperative Considerations

- **Tachycardia Management:**
	- Repeat induction bolus of OFA mix if patient remains tachycardic before skin incision.
	- Consider additional 25 mg Ketamine before skin incision.

## Pre-End of Surgery Adjustment

- **Reduce OFA Mix:** Decrease to 0.05 mL/kg ABW/hr 15 minutes before the end of surgery.

## Postoperative Management

- **OFA Mix Infusion:** Continue at 0.05 mL/kg ABW/hr
- **Additional Analgesia:**
	- Paracetamol (Acetaminophen)
	- NSAID (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug)
