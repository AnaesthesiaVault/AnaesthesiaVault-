# Acute Somatic Pain
## Pathophysiology

### Acute Tissue Damage from Three Types of Causes

- Mechanical (e.g., sharp pin)
- Thermal (e.g., hot stove)
- Chemical (e.g., inflammation)

1. **Nociceptors activated at site of injury (1st order sensory neurons)**
	
	- **Nociceptive fibres (Aδ and C) carry noxious sensory information to the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the spinal cord**
	- **Excitatory neurotransmitters are released and stimulate 2nd order sensory neurons**
2. **2nd order sensory neurons immediately cross the midline of the spinal cord and ascend up the opposite side's anterolateral (aka spinothalamic) tracts, terminating in various locations:**
	
	- **To Thalamus**
		- 2nd order neuron terminates in thalamus
		- In the thalamus, 2nd order sensory neurons synapse with 3rd order sensory neurons, which carry the signal to the cerebral cortex
		- _Outcome: Pain localization and sensation_
	- **To Brainstem**
		- 2nd order neuron synapses in periaqueductal gray area (PGA) in the midbrain
		- Stimulates descending pathways to modulate the incoming pain signal
		- _Outcome: Decreased or increased perception of pain_
	- **To Hypothalamus**
		- 2nd order neuron synapses in the hypothalamus
		- Hypothalamic neurons coordinate the body's visceral response to pain
		- _Outcome: Increased heart rate and nausea_

### Nociceptors

- **Definition:** Neurons that detect noxious or painful stimuli and carry this information to the spinal cord.
- **Two major types:**
	- **Aδ fibres:** Myelinated, initial "sharp, fast" feeling
	- **C fibres:** Unmyelinated, delayed "dull, burning" feeling
# WHO Ladder

### WHO Ladder for Pain Management

1. **Step 1:**
	
	- Nonopioid analgesics
	- NSAIDs
2. **Step 2:**
	
	- Weak opioids
3. **Step 3:**
	
	- Strong opioids
	- Methadone
	- Oral administration
	- Transdermal patch
	- NSAIDs (with or without adjuvants at each step)
4. **Step 4:**
	
	- Nerve block
	- Epidurals
	- PCA pump
	- Neurolytic block therapy
	- Spinal stimulators
5. **Neurosurgical procedures:**
	
	- Indications: Acute pain, chronic pain without control, acute crises of chronic pain
# Analgesic Options for Acute Pain
- Dexamethasone: Inhibits release of arachadonic acid from cell membrane & inhibits inflammatory mediator release.
- Alpha 2 receptor agonists:
	- Clonidine 1mcg/kg
	- Dexmedetomidine 1mcg/kg bolus + 0.5mcg/kg IV
- Ketamine:
	- Reversible NMDA receptor antagonist & inhibits the reuptake of neurotransmitters (NA, serotonin and dopamine)
- Opioids
- MgSO4
- Paracetamol
- NSAIDs
- Lignocaine infusions
# Nerve Fibres

|Type|Diameter (micrometre)|Conduction speed (meters/second)|Myelin content|Function|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|A alpha|12–20|70–120|+++|Motor|
|A beta|5–12|30–70|+++|Touch and pressure|
|A gamma|1–4|15–30|++|Proprioception and muscle tone|
|A delta|1–4|12–30|++|Fast pain and temperature|
|B fibres|1–3|3–15|+|Preganglionic autonomic|
|C fibres|0.5–1|0.5–2|Unmyelinated|Slow pain and temperature, postganglionic autonomic|
