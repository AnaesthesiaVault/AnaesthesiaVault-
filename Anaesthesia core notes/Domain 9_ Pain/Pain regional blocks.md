# Evaluation for Epidural Steroids Injection
## Predictive Factors and Increased Risk for Pain Conditions

### History
#### Positive Factors
- Radicular pain
- Radicular numbness
- Short symptom duration
- Absence of significant psychological factors

#### Negative Predictive Factors
- Axial pain primarily
- Work-related injury
- Unemployed due to pain
- High number of past treatments, high number of drugs taken
- Compensation due to pain
- Litigation pending
- Previous back surgery
- Smoking history
- Very high pain ratings

#### Increased Risk
- Immunosuppression
- Diabetes
- Peptic ulcer disease
- Tuberculosis
- AIDS
- Bacterial infection

### Examination
#### Positive Factors
- Dermatomal sensory loss
- Motor loss correlated to symptoms
- Positive straight leg raising

#### Negative Predictive Factors
- Myofascial pain prominent

### Laboratory Results
#### Positive Factors
- Abnormal EMG findings related to symptoms
- Lumbar herniated disc
- Cervical spondylosis

#### Negative Predictive Factors
- Normal cervical spine imaging scans
- Cervical herniated disc
# Alternatives for Pain Management

## Pharmacological
- Paracetamol
- Opioids
- Muscle relaxants
- Alpha-2 agonists
- Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA)
- Anticonvulsants
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

## Nerve Blocks
### Specific
- Selective nerve root blocks
- Facet blocks
- Medial branch blocks

### General
- Epidurals
- Caudals

## Non-Pharmacological
- Physiotherapy
- Psychology/Psychiatry
- Occupational therapy

# Coeliac Plexus Blocks

## Indications

For the relief of intractable pain from non-pelvic intra-abdominal organs:

- **Chronic Pain:** e.g., pancreatitis (Local Anaesthetic only)
- **Cancer Pain:** Local Anaesthetic for diagnosis followed by neurolysis

## Method
- **Position:** Prone
- **Screening:** X-ray screening in two planes
- **Sedation:** IV sedation
- **Infiltration:** Local Anaesthetic infiltration of skin and subcutaneous tissue
- **IV Fluids:** Administered pre-block to reduce risk of post-procedure hypotension due to vasodilation
- **Needle Entry Point:** Just below the tip of the 12th rib
- **Procedure:**
  - Advance needle to contact L1 vertebra, then walk off vertebra avoiding aorta and IVC
  - Inject radio-opaque dye to confirm needle placement
  - Inject mixture:
	- **Non-Malignant Pain:** 10 ml Local Anaesthetic
	- **Malignant Pain:** 5 ml 6% phenol & 5 ml Local Anaesthetic
  - Bilateral block may be needed

## Complications
### Consequences of the Block
- Severe hypotension and orthostatic hypotension (vasodilation)
- Diarrhoea

### Damage to Surrounding Structures
- Bleeding (IVC or aortic injury)
- Abscess or cyst formation (abdominal organ puncture)
- Pneumothorax
- Retroperitoneal haemorrhage

### Injection into the Wrong Area or Inadvertent Spread of Local Anaesthetic
- IV injection (Local Anaesthetic toxicity)
- Paraplegia (if injected into arteries supplying the spinal cord, e.g., artery of Adamkiewicz)
- Sexual dysfunction (spread to sympathetic chain)
- Lumbar nerve root irritation (buttock, leg pain, numbness, weakness)
- Spinal/Epidural injection

# Superficial Cervical Plexus Block

## Technique
- Injection site: Just behind the sternocleidomastoid (SCM)
- Location: Mid-point between the C6 transverse process and mastoid
- Injection: Superficial, with a fan up and down technique

# Paravertebral Block

## Anatomy

The paravertebral space (PVS) is a wedge-shaped space located on either side of the vertebral column.

- **Anterolateral Boundary:** Parietal pleura (in thoracic area)
- **Base:** Vertebral body, intervertebral disc, and intervertebral foramen

## Technique
- **Preparation:** Sedative premedication recommended
- **Position:** Patient sitting
- **Aseptic Technique:** Required
- **Equipment:** Epidural set
- **Injection Site:** 2.5 cm lateral to the spinous process (one level above the desired block)
- **Procedure:**
  - Local infiltration of skin
  - Perpendicular insertion of Tuohy needle until transverse process is hit (max depth 4 cm thoracic, 5 cm lumbar)
  - Walk needle caudally off transverse process (1.5 cm further advancement max)
  - Use loss of resistance technique
  - Multiple levels can be blocked as required with 4-5 ml of Local Anaesthetic at each level
  - Anaesthesia develops over 30 minutes and lasts approximately 12 hours
- **Imaging:** Ultrasound guidance recommended
