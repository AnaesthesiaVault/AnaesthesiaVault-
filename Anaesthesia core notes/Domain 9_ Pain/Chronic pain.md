# Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240522121049.png)

# Introduction

- The lack of diagnostic biomarkers and universally effective treatment options for chronic pain often result in frustration for both patients and clinicians.
- This summary outlines an approach to identifying and discussing chronic pain with patients, based on guidance from the UK, patient voices, and clinical experience.

## Factors Suggestive of a Chronic Primary Pain Diagnosis

### Pain-related Factors

- **Widespread pain** (although only regional pain may be reported)
- **Pain longevity** (≥ 3 months)
- **Ineffective treatments so far**
- **Already diagnosed** with a chronic pain condition

### Non-pain-related Factors

- **Poor refreshment from sleep**
- **Intrusive fatigue**
- **Mood disturbance**
- **Hypersensitivity** to visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli
- **Poor concentration and short-term memory**

### Consultation Findings

- **Numerous comorbid illnesses and allergies**
- **Feeling overwhelmed** (patient, clinician, or both)
- **Pain affecting identity**, including work and hobbies
## Classification

### Chronic Primary Pain

- **Definition**: Pain in one or more anatomical regions persisting for more than 3 months, associated with significant emotional distress or functional disability, and not better accounted for by another chronic pain condition. This distinguishes chronic pain (as that persisting beyond normal tissue healing time) from physiological, acute pain. As this timeframe can be difficult to quantify, and a clear trigger or injury is absent in many cases, a somewhat arbitrary cut-off period of three to six months was originally adopted by IASP in 1994
- **Examples**:
	- Chronic headache or orofacial pain (e.g., chronic migraine)
	- Chronic primary visceral pain (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome)
	- Chronic primary musculoskeletal pain (e.g., non-specific lower back pain)
	- Chronic widespread pain (e.g., fibromyalgia)
	- Chronic regional pain syndrome

### Chronic Secondary Pain

- **Definition**: Pain linked to another disease but problematic in its own right. May continue beyond successful treatment of the initial cause.  
- **Examples**:
	- Chronic cancer-related pain (e.g., linked to tumour, metastases, or treatment)
	- Chronic secondary headache or orofacial pain
	- Chronic post-surgical or post-traumatic pain
	- Chronic secondary visceral pain (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease)
	- Chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis)
	- Chronic neuropathic pain (e.g., diabetic neuropathy)

**Note**: Test results may be normal but pain processes are not working properly.

## Sharing the Diagnosis

### Validate Symptoms

- Emphasize the importance of feeling believed and being listened to. Validation of a person’s experience is essential.
- Stress that normal investigations do not mean there is not a problem.

### Explain Pain Processes

- Educate patients about the science of pain, which can be useful even if the mechanisms are not fully understood.
- Explain that while pain normally helps us avoid damage, it doesn’t always mean injury or tissue damage.

### Multifactorial Nature

- Discuss how various parts of the brain, including those involved in learning, memory, mood, sleep, context, movement, and sensation, work together to predict danger signals.
- Highlight that factors such as stress can trigger worsening symptoms.

### Positive Diagnosis

- People living with chronic pain value a specific diagnosis and an explanation of the cause of the pain.
- Evidence shows patients appreciate the difficulty in treating chronic pain and the lack of certainty involved.

## Diagnosis
### Practical Tips for Discussing the Diagnosis of Chronic Primary Pain

#### What is the Cause of My Pain?

Explain that, while our usual understanding of pain is as a response to the damage of tissues, it can be more helpful to think of pain as an early warning alert system. It makes us aware of potential danger, but doesn’t necessarily wait for tissue injury to occur.

In chronic primary pain, the tissues may be normal but the pain processes are not working properly. For this reason, investigations may be normal but this doesn’t mean there is not a problem.

An example, such as phantom limb pain in a patient who has had an amputation, may be helpful.

### Considerations for Shared Decision-Making Discussions about Chronic Primary Pain

- Validate the patient’s pain. Stress that normal results of investigations do not mean there is not a problem.
- Reinforce a positive diagnosis of chronic primary pain and discuss management strategies.
- Discuss how pain is a complex sensation and many factors can affect the sensitivity of the early warning alert system. Several parts of the brain, including those involved in learning, memory, mood, sleep, context, movement, and sensation, work together to try to accurately predict danger signals, and this is why other factors, such as stress, can trigger worsening of symptoms.
- Explain that no medication or procedure is likely to resolve the problem.
- Although the mechanisms are not fully understood and pain cannot always be explained, learning more about the pain can be helpful for some patients.

# Prevention of Postoperative Chronic Pain

## Overview

- Evidence on the prevention of postoperative chronic pain is mixed and varies across studies.
- Optimizing analgesia is a key strategy to reduce the incidence of chronic pain after surgery.

## Effective Interventions

1. **Regional Anesthesia**
	
	- **Blocks**: Local anesthetic nerve blocks.
	- **Epidurals**: Continuous or single-shot epidural anesthesia.
	- **Spinal Anesthesia**: Single-shot or continuous spinal anesthesia.
2. **Intravenous Medications**
	
	- **IV Lignocaine (Lidocaine)**: Systemic lignocaine has been shown to reduce postoperative pain and the development of chronic pain.
3. **Ketamine**
	
	- Perioperative use of ketamine, due to its NMDA receptor antagonist properties, can reduce postoperative pain and potentially decrease the risk of chronic pain.
4. **Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)**
	
	- The use of nitrous oxide in the perioperative period has been associated with reduced incidence of chronic postoperative pain.
