# Opioid Mechanisms and Management in Anaesthesia

## Mechanisms of Action (MOA)

The mechanisms of opioid-induced antinociception are produced by opioid binding to opioid receptors in the brainstem and spinal cord. Opioid-induced decrease in arousal is produced by the blockade of cholinergic arousal projections from the brainstem to the thalamus and cortex.

- Binding to opioid receptors disrupts information transmission in the nociceptive circuits by decreasing conductance of voltage-gated calcium channels and opening inward-rectifying potassium channels.
- Activation of the opioid receptors has two principal effects on nociceptive information transmission:
  - Blocking afferent nociceptive inputs into the spinal cord.
  - Enhancing descending inhibition of nociceptive inputs beginning at the level of the periaqueductal gray.
- These descending projections originate in the periaqueductal gray and project to the spinal cord through synapses in the rostral ventral medulla.
- These two effects of opioids decrease nociceptive information processing. In contrast, action of the opioids in the amygdala decreases nociceptive perception and the emotional effect of nociceptive and pain stimulation.
- These multisite antinociceptive effects are also one of the mechanisms through which opioids decrease arousal.
- Opioids also decrease arousal through their inhibitory actions on brainstem cholinergic circuits at the level of the lateral dorsal tegmental nucleus, the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, the median pontine reticular formation, and the thalamus.
- Opioids enhance cholinergic input to the sinoatrial node, induce bradycardia, and thereby mitigate sympathetic responses associated with nociception.

## Definitions

### Tolerance
- Predictable and physiological.
- Increased dose required for the same effect.
- Diminished effect from the same dose; rightward shift in the dose-response curve–greater dose required for the same clinical effect.

### Physical Dependence
- Predictable and physiological.
- Stop, reverse, reduce = withdrawal syndrome.
- Neuropharmacological disorder characterized by neuronal adaptation and plasticity–characterized by drug-class-specific withdrawal syndrome.

### Addiction
- Unpredictable effect of the drug (a disease).
- Aberrant drug-seeking/drug-taking behavior.
- Despite risks of physical, social, and psychological harm.
- Neurobiological disorder characterized by particular patterns of behavior and psychological adaptations–including impaired control over use, continued use despite causing harm, and cravings.

### Pseudo-Addiction
- Drug seeking due to under-treatment of pain.
- Resolves when pain relief is adequate.
- Based on one 1989 case report, and the definition was never subjected to serious study.
- Potentially dangerous behavior related to drug-seeking due to under-treatment of pain.

### Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH)
- A state of nociceptive sensitization secondary to exposure to opioids.
- Often more diffuse and widespread pattern of pain.
- Differential: opioid tolerance, disease progression, opioid withdrawal, opioid addiction, pseudo addiction (pain).
  - OIH worsens with more opioids, the others all improve.

## Differential Diagnosis for OIH

| Condition                   | Clinical Features                                                                                                                                             | Onset          | Response to Opioid Treatment                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Opioid-induced hyperalgesia | Paradoxical increase in pain associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia. Pain may occur at a different location and can be widespread.                         | Abrupt/gradual | Pain worsens                                       |
| Opioid tolerance            | Persistent pain and localized. Tolerance may occur to therapeutic or side-effects.                                                                            | Gradual        | Pain improves                                      |
| Disease progression         | Pain gradually worsening despite being on opioids. Pain may be present in other than the original site.                                                       | Gradual        | Pain improves                                      |
| Opioid addiction            | Behavior includes impaired control and compulsive use of the drug, continued use despite harm, and craving.                                                   | Gradual        | Pain may improve, but aberrant behavior may worsen |
| Pseudo-addiction            | Pain is under-treated, resulting in patients seeking opioids for pain relief.                                                                                 | Variable       | Pain improves                                      |
| Opioid withdrawal           | Acute phase adrenergic symptoms such as tachycardia, hypertension, and sweating. Flu-like symptoms with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Increases pain sensitivity. | Abrupt         | Pain improves                                      |
| Physical dependence         | Adaptation with chronic opioid use, resulting in tolerance and physical withdrawal symptoms when the drug is abruptly stopped or dosage reduced.               | Gradual        | Pain improves                                      |

## Treatment Options

- **Limit dose & duration of remifentanil.**
- **Choose an alternative drug.**
- **Multimodal analgesia to reduce the dose of remifentanil.**
- **Ketamine** (NMDA antagonist): Trend to benefit but not statistically significant. Bolus 0.3 mg/kg & infusion 0.3 mg/kg/hr.
- **N2O** (NMDA antagonist): Limited data.
- **Propofol**: Reduced postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption compared with volatiles.
- **Paracetamol**: Loading dose pre-induction reduces OIH.
- **COX2 inhibitors**: May play a role.
- **Naloxone infusions**: 0.25 mcg/kg/hr = reduced opioid consumption & fewer opioid side effects.

# Opioid Tolerance/Addiction

## Post-Operative Pain Management Options

1. **Opioid-Sparing Techniques:** Paracetamol, NSAIDs, LA (infiltration ± WIC's, blocks ± catheters, neuraxial), Ketamine, Gabapentinoids, Lignocaine infusions.
2. **Prevention of Withdrawal:** Continue patient's baseline opioid.
3. **Additional Opioids:** PRN or PCA - dosing based on requirements of the last 24 hours.
4. **Opioid Rotation:** Switching from one opioid to another at 30-50% equivalent dose - may work due to incomplete cross-tolerance.

### Ketamine

- Recommended in the acute pain management of opioid-tolerant patients as it has been shown to reduce postoperative opioid use and pain scores.
- Activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is believed to be one of the mechanisms for the development of opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). Ketamine is a non-competitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor and can attenuate both phenomena.
- Administered in a low dose as a continuous IV or subcutaneous infusion for 1–3 days can be a useful adjunct for opioid-tolerant patients.
- Recommended starting dose: 100–200 mg per 24 hours, using a mixture of 200 mg ketamine and 5 mg midazolam made up to a total volume of 48 ml with normal saline and a rate of infusion of 1–2 ml/hour.
### Converting Equivalent Doses

![](Pasted%20image%2020240703224916.png)

**Converting to an Equivalent IV Dose of Morphine**

- An opioid-tolerant patient taking 200 mg of sustained-release morphine twice daily requires an emergency laparotomy and is expected to be nil by mouth postoperatively.
- To prevent withdrawal, maintain the usual oral 24 h opioid dose of 400 mg.
- Convert the dose of oral morphine to IV morphine. Ratio between 3:1 and 2:1.
- Using a 3:1 conversion ratio:
	- Total IV dose over 24 h = 133 mg.
	- Background infusion (133 mg 24 h^-1) = 5.5 mg h^-1.
	- Bolus dose: start at 50% of the hourly background rate = 2.5–3 mg (with 5 min lockout).

**Table 2: Opioid Rotation from Oral Methadone to IV Morphine**

- An emergency laparotomy is required in a patient taking 100 mg of oral methadone and whom will be nil by mouth after operation.
- As the patient is unable to take oral methadone, this is converted to a suitable IV dose to prevent withdrawal.
- Conversion ratio for oral methadone to oral morphine 1:2 or 3.
- Using a 1:3 ratio 100 mg of oral methadone is equivalent to 300 mg of oral morphine.
- 300 mg of oral morphine is equivalent to 100 mg of IV morphine.
- Due to incomplete cross-tolerance between opioids, a 50% reduction in the calculated equianalgesic dose is recommended.
- The dose of IV morphine required to prevent withdrawal over 24 h is 50 mg.
- This can be provided via PCA with either:
	- An increased bolus dose of between 1.5 and 2 mg.
	- A standard PCA bolus of 1 mg but with a background infusion of 2 mg h^-1.

**Table 3: Converting from IV to Oral Opioid**

- 60 mg IV morphine 24 h^-1 = 120–180 mg oral morphine.
- 50% of this dose = 60–90 mg/day and therefore = 30–45 mg morphine sulphate (MST) b.d.
- PRN = 1/6 of 120–180 mg = 20–30 mg p.r.n. 4 hourly.

## Opioid Rotation and Conversion

### Opioid Rotation
- **Reduction in Dose:** When performing an opioid rotation, it is recommended to reduce the calculated equianalgesic dose by 30–50% due to the possibility of incomplete cross-tolerance.

### Conversion from IV to Oral Opioids
- **Strategy:**
  - Identify the IV opioid consumption over the previous 24 hours.
  - Convert this to an equivalent oral dose.
  - Administer 50% of this oral equivalent dose in a sustained-release form.
  - Prescribe one-sixth of the equivalent dose as an immediate-release (IR) preparation every 4 hours.

### Equianalgesic Doses
**1 mg of oral morphine is equivalent to:**
- 0.33 mg IV morphine
- 3 mg tapentadol
- 5-10 mg tramadol
- 10 mg codeine
- 0.5 mg oxycodone
- 0.25 mcg/hr fentanyl patch
- 0.5 mcg/hr buprenorphine patch
- 2-3 mg methadone

**Note:** Due to incomplete cross-tolerance, it is recommended that the starting dose be 50% of the calculated equianalgesic dose.

## Substitution Therapy

### Objectives
- Reduce harm from problematic drug use
- Provide stability
- Prevent withdrawal
- Reduce preoccupation and craving

### Methadone

- **Initiation and Titration:**
  - Initial dose: 10-40 mg (specialist only)
  - Increment: 10 mg (max 30 mg per week)
  - Maintenance dose: 60-120 mg/day
- **Pharmacology:**
  - μ-agonist, NMDA-antagonist, monoamine reuptake inhibitor
  - Metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver to inactive metabolites
  - Weak inhibitor of CYP3A4
- **Perioperative Management:**
  - Continue usual oral methadone perioperatively if possible.
  - Use additional IR opioids for acute pain.
  - If NPO or gastrointestinal absorption is a concern, consider rotation to IV fentanyl or morphine PCA.

### Buprenorphine

- **Pharmacology:**
  - Partial agonist at μ-receptors, antagonist at κ and δ receptors
  - High receptor affinity, slow dissociation, extended action
  - Less sedating and euphoric, used to suppress opioid withdrawal and craving
- **Perioperative Management:**
  - Concern for antagonizing full agonist effects, leading to withdrawal or analgesic failure.
  - Strategies:
	- Continue buprenorphine with additional full opioid agonists or supplemental buprenorphine doses.
	- Rotate to a full agonist before surgery, such as methadone.
  - Case report: Baseline 24/6 mg buprenorphine/naloxone, supplemented with 2/0.5 mg as required, max 72/18 mg daily.

### Naltrexone

- **Usage:**
  - For patients highly motivated to remain abstinent from alcohol or substance abuse.
  - Competitive opioid antagonist with a duration of 48–72 hours.
  - Chronic use increases sensitivity to morphine-induced analgesia and μ- and δ-opioid receptors.
- **Perioperative Management:**
  - Stop 72 hours before surgery.
  - Maximize opioid-sparing strategies (e.g., regional anesthesia).
  - Consider high-dependency care postoperatively for monitoring.

## Perioperative Management of Patients on Opioids

### General Recommendations
- **Patches:** Continue, but monitor site (heat ↑ drug delivery, cold/poor perfusion ↓ delivery).
- **Methadone:** Continue and supplement with additional opioids for acute pain. Rotate to PCA or IV if NPO.
- **SL Buprenorphine:**
  - Continue and supplement with full opioids or more buprenorphine.
  - Rotate to a full agonist if necessary.
- **Naltrexone:** Stop 72 hours prior to surgery, employ opioid-sparing strategies, and ensure high-care monitoring post-op.

### Preventing Withdrawal
- **Maintain opioids:** Consider IV morphine if prolonged NPO.
- **Calculate opioid equivalency:**
  - Tramadol (oral): divide by 5 or 10 (e.g., 400 mg → 40 mg PO morphine)
  - Codeine (oral): divide by 10 (e.g., 64 mg → 6.4 mg PO morphine)
  - Oxycodone (oral): multiply by 2 (e.g., 40 mg → 80 mg PO morphine)
  - Total daily dose PO morphine equivalence: 126.4 mg
  - Total IV dose equivalence: divide by 3 (e.g., 42 mg/day)

### Withdrawal Symptoms
- **Cardiovascular:** Palpitations
- **Autonomic:** Sweating, restlessness, runny nose, tearing
- **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- **Neuromuscular:** Tremor, yawning, anxiety/irritability, gooseflesh
- **Other:** Bone/joint aches, pupil size changes (sign, not symptom)
