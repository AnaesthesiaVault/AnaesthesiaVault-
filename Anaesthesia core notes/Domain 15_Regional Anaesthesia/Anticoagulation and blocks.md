# Regional Anaesthesia in Patients on Anticoagulation

## Comparison Between the ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Pain Guidelines

### General Recommendations
- All previous ASRA guidelines, including the current fourth edition, do not recommend discontinuation of aspirin or NSAIDs prior to the placement of epidural and spinal blocks.
- The guidelines do not differentiate between interventional pain procedures and perioperative regional anesthesia blocks, needle/catheter trauma, degree of anticoagulation, and ability to compress the site.
- ASRA guidelines may be appropriate for lowor intermediate-risk categories, but high-risk spine procedures require a more conservative approach.

### Aspirin and NSAIDs Management
- Aspirin and NSAIDs may be continued for low-risk pain procedures.
- For mediumand high-risk procedures, antiplatelet therapy is discontinued.
  - **Discontinuation Length for Aspirin**:
	- **Primary Prevention (no overt cardiovascular disease)**: 6 days
	- **Secondary Prophylaxis**: 4 days
  - **Discontinuation Length for NSAIDs**:
	- **1 to 2 days**: Ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketorolac, indomethacin
	- **4 days**: Naproxen, meloxicam
	- **6 days**: Nabumetone
	- **10 days**: Oxaprozin, piroxicam
- Aspirin and NSAIDs can be resumed a day after the procedure.

### Potent Antiplatelet Agents
- There is no significant difference between the guidelines in managing more potent antiplatelet agents, including clopidogrel, ticlopidine, ticagrelor, and prasugrel.

### Heparin Management
- Regional guidelines allow neuraxial injections in patients receiving SC BID heparin.
- Pain guidelines prefer that moderateand high-risk procedures not be performed.
  - If an interventional procedure is indicated, an interval of 6 hours (rather than 4-6 hours) should be followed.

### Timing Intervals for Neuraxial Injection
- Regional anesthesia guidelines recommend a 4to 6-hour interval between administration of the drug and neuraxial injection.
- Pain guidelines recommend an interval of 6 hours.

### LMWH, Warfarin, Thrombolytic Therapy, and Fondaparinux
- The guidelines on LMWH, warfarin, thrombolytic therapy, and fondaparinux are the same for both regional anesthesia/acute pain and interventional pain patients.
## Procedural Anticoagulation Management Checklist

### Evaluate Baseline Patient-Specific Risk Factors for Perioperative Bleeding
- History and physical examination signs suggestive of a bleeding disorder:
  - History of unexplained nosebleeds (epistaxis) or menorrhagia
  - Examination signs including petechiae, mucosal bleeding, purpura, or ecchymoses
- Family history of bleeding disorders.
- Screen for antiplatelet, antithrombotic, or thrombolytic therapy.
- Screen for SNRIs, SSRIs, and herbal therapies that may influence coagulation status.
- Order coagulation tests when needed based on history and physical examination and/or medication use.
- Identify aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs utilization.

### For Individuals on Aspirin Categorize Reason for Utilization
- Primary prophylaxis → absence of established cardiovascular disease or risk factor.
- Secondary prophylaxis → presence of cardiovascular disease.

### Process the Anatomical Location of Procedural Intervention into Decision-Making
- Intracanal vs extracanal spinal procedures
- Cervicothoracic neuraxial area or lumbosacral neuraxial area.
- Surrounding vascular structures at risk for penetration.

### Review Appropriate Radiographic Imaging to Identify and Understand Anatomic Challenges
- Cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal stenosis that alter spinal canal anatomy
- Epidural fibrosis and significant scar tissue from previous surgical intervention

### Identify and Manage Pharmacologic Coagulopathies
- Understand drug elimination and appropriate discontinuation time.
- Determine appropriate timing for reinitiation of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy.
- Practice informed decision-making involving procedural physician, prescribing medical physician, and patient.

### Employ Post-Procedure Surveillance for the Detection of Bleeding Complications

## Stratification of Risk According to Procedures

### Low Risk
**Regional Guidelines:**
- Superficial and compressible plexus/peripheral nerve blocks

**Pain Guidelines:**
- Peripheral nerve blocks
- Joint injections
- Sacroiliac joint and sacral lateral branch blocks

### Intermediate Risk
**Regional Guidelines:**
- Other procedures based on compressibility, patient body habitus, comorbidities, and the degree and duration of anticoagulation

**Pain Guidelines:**
- Neuraxial injections
- Facet procedures
- Visceral sympathetic blocks
- Pocket revision

### High Risk
**Regional Guidelines:**
- Neuraxial blocks
- Deep and noncompressible plexus/peripheral nerve blocks

**Pain Guidelines:**
- Spinal cord stimulator trial and implant
- Intrathecal pump trial and implant
- Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty
- Epiduroscopy

### Patient Characteristics Associated With Increased Sensitivity to Warfarin

- Age >65 y
- Female sex
- Weight <100 lb
- Liver, cardiac, or renal disease
- Asian ancestry
- Excessive surgical blood loss

### Half-lives of Vitamin K–Dependent Clotting Factors

| Factor VII | 6–8           |
| Factor IX  | 24            |
| Factor X   | 25–60         |
| Factor II  | 50–80         |

### Perioperative Management of Patients on Warfarin

#### Preoperative
- Discontinue warfarin at least 5 days before elective procedure
- Assess INR 1–2 d prior to surgery, if >1.5, consider 1–2 mg oral vitamin K
- Reversal for urgent surgery/procedure, consider 2.5–5 mg oral or IV vitamin K; for immediate reversal, consider PCCs, fresh frozen plasma
- Patients at high risk of thromboembolism
  - Bridge with therapeutic SC LMWH (preferred) or IV UFH
  - Last dose of preoperative LMWH administered 24 h before surgery, administer half of the daily dose
  - Intravenous heparin discontinued 4–6 h before surgery
- No bridging necessary for patients at low risk of thromboembolism

#### Postoperative
- Patients at low risk of thromboembolism
  - Resume warfarin on POD
- Patients at high risk of thromboembolism (who received preoperative bridging therapy)
  - Minor surgical procedure—resume therapeutic LMWH 24 h postoperatively
  - Major surgical procedure—resume therapeutic LMWH 48–72 h postoperatively or administer low-dose LMWH
- Assess bleeding risk and adequacy of hemostasis when considering timing of the resumption of LMWH or UFH therapy

## Antiplatelet

### ASRA Guidelines on the Use of Antiplatelet Agents and Neuraxial Techniques

#### NSAIDs
- **Recommendations**: No specific concerns regarding the timing of single-injection or catheter techniques in relation to NSAID dosing, postoperative monitoring, or neuraxial catheter removal.
- **Grade**: 1A

#### Thienopyridines
- **Preoperative Discontinuation Intervals**:
  - **Ticlopidine**: 10 days
  - **Clopidogrel**: 5-7 days
  - **Prasugrel**: 7-10 days
- **Neuraxial Catheter Maintenance**:
  - **Prasugrel or Ticagrelor**: Not recommended due to rapid onset.
  - **Ticlopidine or Clopidogrel**: May be maintained for 1-2 days if no loading dose was given.
- **Grade**: 1C for discontinuation intervals, 2C for catheter maintenance

#### Ticagrelor
- **Preoperative Discontinuation Interval**: 5-7 days
- **Postoperative Resumption**:
  - Immediate if no loading dose.
  - 6 hours post-removal if a loading dose is administered.

- **Grade**: 1C for discontinuation interval, 2C for catheter maintenance

#### Platelet Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa Inhibitors
- **Preoperative Recommendations**: Avoid neuraxial techniques until platelet function has recovered. Patients often have residual NSAID effects due to dual therapy.
- **Postoperative Recommendations**: Contraindicated within 4 weeks of surgery. Timing of catheter removal depends on thromboembolism risk, need for continued antithrombotic therapy, and potential for spinal bleeding.
- **Grade**: Not specified

#### Cilostazol
- **Preoperative Discontinuation Interval**: 2 days

- **Postoperative Recommendations**:
  - Remove catheter before resuming therapy.
  - First postoperative dose can be administered 6 hours after catheter removal.
- **Grade**: 2C

#### Cangrelor
- **Preoperative Discontinuation Interval**: 3 hours based on elimination half-life.
- **Postoperative Recommendations**:
  - Remove catheter before resuming therapy.
  - First postoperative dose can be administered 8 hours after catheter removal.
- **Grade**: 2C

- **Catheter Removal**: No definitive recommendation; frequent neurological checks and fibrinogen levels assessment are suggested.
- **Grade**: 1A for avoiding procedures, 2C for monitoring and catheter removal

## Intravenous and Subcutaneous Unfractionated Heparin

### Heparin
#### Intravenous Heparin
- **Preoperative**: Discontinue infusion 4-6 hours prior and verify normal coagulation status before neuraxial block. Delay heparin administration for 1 hour post-needle placement.
- **Postoperative**: Remove indwelling neuraxial catheters 4-6 hours after the last IV heparin dose, assess coagulation status, and reheparinize 1 hour post-removal. Use dilute local anesthetic and monitor for early motor blockade detection.
- **Grade**: 1A

#### Subcutaneous Heparin
- **Preoperative**:
  - **Low-dose (5000 U BID or TID)**: Perform neuraxial block 4-6 hours after administration or assess coagulation status.
  - **Higher-dose (7500-10,000 U BID or daily < 20,000 U)**: Perform neuraxial block 12 hours after administration and assess coagulation status.
  - **Therapeutic-dose (>10,000 U dose or > 20,000 U total daily)**: Perform neuraxial block 24 hours after administration and assess coagulation status.
- **Postoperative**:
  - **Low-dose**: Remove catheter 4-6 hours after administration and resume heparin immediately post-block or catheter removal.
  - **Higher-dose (>5000 U or >15,000 U daily)**: Safety of indwelling catheters not established; assess risks and benefits on a case-by-case basis.
- **Grade**: 2C

## Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin

### Recommendations
- **Antifactor Xa Levels**: Peak 3-5 hours post-administration; elimination 3-6 hours post-SC injection in normal renal function.
- **Concomitant Medications**: Avoid coadministration with antiplatelet or oral anticoagulation medications if an indwelling catheter is present.
- **Monitoring**: Routine antifactor Xa level monitoring is not recommended. Assess platelet count if LMWH is used for more than 4 days before neuraxial block or catheter removal.
- **Grade**: 1A

### Preoperative LMWH Dosing
- **Prophylactic Dose**: Needle placement at least 12 hours after dose.
- **Higher Therapeutic Dose**: Needle placement at least 24 hours after dose.
- **Grade**: 1A

### Postoperative LMWH Dosing
- **BID Prophylactic Dosing**: Increased risk of spinal hematoma; administer the first dose the following day, no earlier than 12 hours post-needle placement. Remove catheters before LMWH initiation and delay administration for 4 hours post-removal.
- **Single Daily Prophylactic Dose**: First postoperative dose at least 12 hours post-needle placement; second dose no sooner than 24 hours after the first. Maintain indwelling catheters, remove 12 hours after the last dose, and resume at least 4 hours post-removal.
- **Single/BID Therapeutic Dose**: Resume 24 hours post non-high-bleeding-risk surgery and 48 hours post high-bleeding-risk surgery. Remove indwelling catheters 4 hours prior to the first postoperative dose or 24 hours post-catheter placement, whichever is greater.
