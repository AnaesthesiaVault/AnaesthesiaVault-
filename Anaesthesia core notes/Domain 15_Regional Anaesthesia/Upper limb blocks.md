# Upper Limb

## Upper Limb Blocks

- The upper extremity is well suited to peripheral nerve blockade because the entire arm and shoulder are innervated by the brachial plexus and blockade is easily accomplished with a single injection.
- The selection of regional technique will be dependent on the anticipated site of surgery as well as the site of the tourniquet. The interscalene approach is well suited for proximal surgery on the shoulder joint and upper arm; the supraclavicular approach is preferable for the upper arm, elbow, and radial side of the forearm and can provide a dense block of the arm providing optimal tourniquet coverage as well; the infraclavicular and axillary approaches are best for the hand, wrist, and forearm.

### Dermatomes

- **Occipital:** C2
- **Supraclavicular:** C3-C5
- **Suprascapular:** C5-C6
- **Subclavius:** C5-C6
- **Long thoracic:** C5-C7
- **Subscapular:** C5-C6
- **Axillary:** C5-C6
- **Intercostal:** T3-T12
- **Primary nerve branches**
- **Intercostobrachial:** T2
- **Cutaneous brachii medialis:** C8-T1
- **Musculocutaneous:** C5-C6
- **Median:** C5-T1
- **Ulnar:** C8-T1
- **Radial:** C5-T1
- **Cutaneous antebrachii medialis:** C8-T1

## Innervation

- Five major terminal nerves come from the plexus (axillary, musculocutaneous, median, ulnar, and radial) and these can be blocked individually or in combination to provide analgesia.
- The interscalene approach is well suited for proximal surgery on the shoulder joint and upper arm; the supraclavicular approach is preferable for the upper arm, elbow, and radial side of the forearm and can provide a dense block of the arm providing optimal tourniquet coverage as well; the infraclavicular and axillary approaches are best for the hand, wrist, and forearm.
- A major advance is the placement of indwelling brachial plexus catheters to provide prolonged analgesia at home, thereby allowing operations that would have traditionally required 2-3 days of hospitalization to be performed as day-stay or short-stay surgery.
### Brachial Plexus

![](Pasted%20image%2020240627083020.png)

The brachial plexus is formed by the anterior primary rami of the lower four cervical nerve roots (C5-C8) and the first thoracic nerve root (T1). It supplies sensory and motor innervation to the entire upper limb except for the trapezius muscle (innervated by the spinal accessory nerve) and the cutaneous innervation of the axilla (supplied by the intercostobrachial nerve).

## Structure of the Brachial Plexus

### Roots
- The ventral rami of C5-T1 spinal nerves form the five roots of the plexus.
- An interscalene block mainly targets the upper roots (C5-C7). Due to the vertical arrangement of the brachial plexus roots in the interscalene groove, C8 and T1 are often missed, hence the ulnar nerve may not be blocked.

### Trunks
- Shortly after leaving the intervertebral foramina, the roots unify to form three trunks:
  - Upper (C5-C6)
  - Middle (C7)
  - Lower (C8-T1)
- Supraclavicular blocks are performed at the level of the brachial plexus trunks to more reliably block the entire upper limb.

### Divisions
- Each trunk divides into two divisions, forming six divisions in total (three anterior and three posterior).
- The divisions generally cannot be blocked reliably because they lie behind the clavicle.

### Cords
- The six divisions unite again to form three cords:
  - Posterior cord (C5-T1) formed by the posterior divisions.
  - Lateral cord (C5-C7) formed by the anterior divisions from the upper and middle trunks.
  - Medial cord (C8-T1) formed by the anterior division of the lower trunk.
- The brachial plexus cords are named according to their relation to the axillary artery.
- Infraclavicular blocks are performed at the level of the cords and can achieve anaesthesia of the entire arm.

### Terminal Branches
- Mixed nerves containing sensory and motor nerve fibres.
  - **Ulnar nerve (C8, T1):** Arises from the medial cord. Provides motor innervation to the intrinsic muscles of the hand and sensation to the medial one and a half fingers.
  - **Musculocutaneous nerve (C5, C6, C7):** Derived from the lateral cord. Provides motor innervation to the flexor muscles (coracobrachialis, biceps brachii, brachialis) and sensory innervation to the lateral surface of the forearm. Continues as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm.
  - **Median nerve (C5-T1):** Arises from both the medial and lateral cords. Provides motor innervation to most flexor muscles in the forearm and thenar muscles of the thumb. Provides cutaneous innervation to the thumb, index finger, middle finger, lateral half of the ring finger, and nail beds of these fingers.
  - **Radial nerve (C5-T1):** The largest branch of the brachial plexus, derived from the posterior cord. Provides motor innervation to the extensor muscles of the elbow, wrist, and fingers, and sensation to the dorsum of the hand. Continues as the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm.
  - **Axillary nerve (C5-C6):** Arises from the posterior cord. Supplies the deltoid and teres minor muscles and provides sensation below the shoulder. Continues as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm.
- Axillary blocks are performed at the level of the terminal branches and depend on the relationship of nerves to the axillary vessels.

### Supraclavicular Branches
- Derived from the brachial plexus but provide innervation above the clavicle.
  - **Long thoracic nerve (C5, C6, C7):** Supplies the serratus anterior muscle.
  - **Dorsal scapular nerve (C5):** Supplies the rhomboid muscles and levator scapulae muscle.
  - **Nerve to the subclavius (C5, C6):** Supplies the subclavius muscle.
  - **Suprascapular nerve (C4, C5, C6):** Supplies the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles.

## Branches of the Cords of the Brachial Plexus

### Posterior Cord Branches (ULTRA)
- Upper subscapular
- Lower subscapular
- Thoracodorsal
- Radial
- Axillary

### Lateral Cord Branches (LLM)
- Lateral pectoral
- Lateral root of the median nerve
- Musculocutaneous

### Medial Cord Branches (MMMUM)
- Medial pectoral
- Medial cutaneous nerve of the arm
- Medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm
- Ulnar
- Medial root of the median nerve

## Shoulder Blocks
- A block of at least the upper two roots (C5 and C6) or the superior trunk of the brachial plexus is necessary.
- Blockade of the supraclavicular nerve is also needed, covering the 'cape' of the shoulder.
- The interscalene approach is best suited for shoulder joint and upper arm surgery, targeting the roots as they exit between the middle and anterior scalene muscles at the C6 level (identified by the cricoid cartilage).
- Complications can include blockade of the cervical sympathetic chain, recurrent laryngeal nerve, phrenic nerve blockade, hypotension, bradycardia, accidental epidural and spinal injection, and permanent spinal cord damage.
- Catheter placement into the brachial plexus allows continuous local anaesthetic infiltration for painful procedures like shoulder arthroplasties, facilitating earlier mobilization. However, this technique does not provide superior postoperative analgesia compared to infusion through an intra-articular catheter.
- For shoulder arthroscopy, a suprascapular nerve block can be used but should be combined with general anaesthesia for adequate analgesia.

## Elbow Blocks
- Surgery on the elbow may be performed with an interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary brachial plexus block or a mid-humeral block with cutaneous infiltration of the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm.
- An axillary approach may not be adequate for midor distal humerus surgery due to the close proximity of the level of blockade to the site of surgery and difficulty in blocking the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.

## Hand and Forearm Blocks
- Axillary blocks are ideal for hand and forearm surgery as the four main nerves (median, ulnar, radial, musculocutaneous) can be selectively identified using ultrasound guidance and/or peripheral nerve stimulation.
- Multiple-stimulation techniques are associated with a greater success rate than single injection techniques.
- This technique is most commonly used for surgery below the shoulder, providing effective analgesia for tourniquets applied to the upper arm. Peripheral nerve blocks at the elbow, wrist, and hand may be performed individually or in combination to provide discrete, distal nerve blockade or to supplement brachial plexus blocks.
- A short-duration brachial plexus block combined with a long-lasting peripheral nerve block allows early mobilization and limb protection while maintaining good peripheral analgesia.

## Bier's Block (IVRA)

### Preparation
- Standard preoperative fasting intervals should be observed.
- Informed patient consent.
- Standard minimum monitoring (electrocardiograph, noninvasive blood pressure, and SpO2).
- Resuscitation equipment available.
- Patient on a tilting trolley with suction available.
- Double-cuffed tourniquet system available and checked.

### Procedure
- Intravenous access in both limbs.
- Double-cuffed tourniquet on operative limb.
- Exsanguinate limb using elevation and digital arterial pressure.
- Inflate proximal tourniquet cuff to 250-300 mmHg and confirm.
- Slowly inject 0.5% prilocaine 40 ml.
- Once anaesthesia is established, inflate the distal cuff to the same pressure.
- Deflate the proximal cuff after confirming the distal cuff is inflated.
- Surgical procedure can proceed.
- Do not deflate the tourniquet until a minimum of 30 minutes has elapsed.
- Observe patient for signs or symptoms of local anaesthetic toxicity.

### Advantages
- Technical simplicity.
- Rapid onset and offset.
- Reliable if carried out correctly.
- Regional anaesthesia for short and simple distal limb procedures.

### Disadvantages
- Unsuitable for major surgery.
- Tourniquet pain.
- Maximum duration of about 90 minutes.
- Bloodless field not possible.
- Potential for local anaesthetic toxicity.
- No effective postoperative analgesia.
