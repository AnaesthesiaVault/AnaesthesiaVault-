[Calgary- Local anaesthetics](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/local-anesthetics-lidocaine-bupivacaine-ropivacaine-procaine-cocaine-mechanism-of-action-and-pharmacodynamics/)

## Mechanism of Action and Pharmacodynamics
### Classification

- **Ester Class:**
	- Cocaine, Procaine.
- **Amide Class:**
	- Lidocaine, Ropivacaine, Bupivacaine.

### Addition of a Vasoconstrictor (e.g., Epinephrine)
- Local vasoconstriction at the site of anesthetic infiltration.
	- Decreases systemic absorption of the anesthetic.
	- Increases anesthesia duration.
	- Decreases bleeding at the site of infiltration.
	- Larger amounts of local anesthetic can be safely administered.

### pH Adjustment

- Increasing pH of injected solution (e.g., adding sodium bicarbonate).
	- Decreases pKa of local anesthetic.
	- Increases unprotonated form of local anesthetic.
	- Increases uptake of anesthetic into neurons.
	- Shortens onset time.

### Local Infiltration

- Diffusion of the drug into tissue.
	- When the tertiary amine of the anesthetic is unprotonated, it is lipophilic and can diffuse across nerve cell lipid membranes.
	- Anesthetic molecule becomes protonated within the neuron.
	- Protonated anesthetic binds to the transmembrane sodium channel.
	- Sodium channels become impermeable to sodium ions, preventing movement across the membrane.
	- Decreases nociceptive neuronal depolarization.
	- Decreases pain sensation.

### Structural Traits

- Aliphatic side chains and lipophilic linkages.
	- High molecular weight.
	- High lipophilicity.
	- Increases anesthetic diffusion through nerve sheaths.
	- Increases anesthetic potency.

### Differential Nerve Blockade

- Anesthetics' effect differs based on neuronal features.
	- Small diameter neurons (e.g., unmyelinated nociceptive neurons) have fewer sodium channels for anesthetic to inhibit, thus blocking pain sensation more quickly than motor function.
	- Unmyelinated neurons allow anesthetic to diffuse freely anywhere along the neuron.
	
## Side Effects and Complications of Local Anesthetics

### Classification

- **Ester Class:**
	
	- Cocaine, Procaine.
- **Amide Class:**
	
	- Ropivacaine, Bupivacaine, Lidocaine.

### Molecular Structure

- Both classes contain a lipophilic aromatic ring and a hydrophilic tertiary amine, making them amphipathic molecules.

### Metabolism

- **Ester Local Anesthetics:**
	
	- Metabolized by plasma cholinesterases.
	- Impaired breakdown in patients with atypical pseudocholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase deficiency, leading to prolonged clearance and increased duration of anesthetic blockade.
- **Amide Local Anesthetics:**
	
	- Metabolized in the liver by hepatic enzymes.
	- Impaired breakdown in patients with liver disease, leading to prolonged clearance and increased duration of anesthetic blockade.

### Local Infiltration

- Diffuses into sympathetic nerves, blocking sodium channels on neuronal membranes and inhibiting sympathetic nerve function.
	
	- Decreases vasoconstrictive signals to vascular smooth muscle.
	- Causes vasodilation of systemic arteries, leading to hypotension.
- Some local anesthetic may enter systemic circulation and reach the heart, blocking ion channels on cardiac myocytes.
	
	- If enough anesthetic reaches cardiac myocytes, their action decreases myocardial electrical signaling and thus decreases cardiac rhythm and contractility.
	- Can result in cardiac arrest.

## Bupivacaine Vs Ropivacaine

### Common Characteristics

- **pKa:** Both bupivacaine and ropivacaine have a pKa of 8.1.
- **Preparation:** Both are available in 0.5% preparations.

### Ropivacaine

- **Isomer:** Ropivacaine is the L-isomer.
- **Lipid Solubility:** Reduced lipid solubility compared to bupivacaine.
	- **Potency:** Lower potency due to reduced lipid solubility.
- **Vasoconstriction:** Acts as a vasoconstrictor at lower doses.
- **Cardiotoxicity:** Less cardiotoxic due to lower lipid solubility.
- **Motor Block:** Results in less motor block.
- **Concentration/Dose:** Higher concentrations or doses are often required compared to bupivacaine for equivalent effect.

### Bupivacaine

- **Lipid Solubility:** Higher lipid solubility compared to ropivacaine.
	- **Potency:** Higher potency due to increased lipid solubility.
- **Cardiotoxicity:** More cardiotoxic due to higher lipid solubility.
- **Motor Block:** Results in more pronounced motor block.

# Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST)

## Pathophysiology

- **Cardiac and Neurological Symptoms**: Local anaesthetic toxicity typically results in both cardiac and neurological symptoms.

### Central Nervous System (CNS)

- **Vulnerability**: The CNS is more vulnerable to the toxic effects of local anaesthetics than the cardiovascular system. This susceptibility is exacerbated in the presence of acidosis.
- **Mechanism**: CNS excitation occurs due to a blockade of inhibitory pathways in the cerebral cortex and an increase in the release of glutamate.

### Cardiovascular System (CVS)

- **Mechanism**: CVS toxicity arises from both direct effects on the heart and peripheral vasculature, as well as indirect effects via blockade of parasympathetic or sympathetic activity.
	- **Bupivacaine**: Decreases the rate of depolarisation in Purkinje fibres and ventricular muscle, and slows the rate of recovery from use-dependent block. This is seen electrophysiologically as prolongation of the QRS complex and the PR interval.
	- **High Doses**: Very high doses of local anaesthetics inhibit spontaneous depolarisation of the sinoatrial node.
	- **Negative Inotropy**: All local anaesthetics exhibit dose-dependent negative inotropy.
	- **Biphasic Action on Peripheral Vasculature**: At low doses, there is an increased tone in the vasculature, whereas at high concentrations, there is a decreased tone.
	- **Direct Relaxant Effect**: At very high blood levels, there is a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle in almost all vascular beds, causing profound peripheral vasodilatation. Combined with negative inotropy, this results in profound cardiovascular collapse with high doses of local anaesthetics.

### Signs & Symptoms

- Tinnitus
- Metallic taste
- Circumoral numbness
- Altered mental status
- Seizures
- Hypotension
- Bradycardia
- Ventricular arrhythmias
- Cardiovascular collapse

### Management

- **Immediate Actions**:
	- Stop the local anaesthetic injection and/or infusion.
	- Call for help.
- **Initial Focus**:
	- **Airway Management**: Ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation; provide 100% FiO2, consider endotracheal intubation (ETT), and prevent hypoxia and acidosis (as they can aggravate LAST).
	- **Seizure Suppression**: Benzodiazepines are preferred. Avoid or minimize propofol if the patient is hemodynamically unstable. If seizures persist, small doses of succinylcholine can be used to minimize acidosis and hypoxia.
	- **Alert Nearby Facility**: Inform the nearest facility with cardiopulmonary bypass capability.
- **Management of Cardiac Arrhythmias**:
	- **Pulseless**: Start CPR.
	- **ACLS Adjustments**: Medications and efforts may need adjustment, potentially requiring prolonged resuscitation efforts.
	- **Epinephrine**: Use doses <1 mcg/kg (small boluses of 10-100 mcg IV).
	- **Avoid**: Vasopressin, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and local anaesthetics.
	- **Ventricular Arrhythmias**: Amiodarone is preferred; avoid lidocaine and procainamide.
	- **Refractory Cases**: Consider cardiopulmonary bypass.

#### Lipid Emulsion (20%) Therapy

- **Administration**:
	- At the first signs of LAST, administer a 1.5 mL/kg bolus (e.g., 105 mL for a 70 kg person) over 1 minute.
	- Start an infusion at 0.25 mL/kg/min.
	- Repeat the bolus once or twice for persistent cardiovascular collapse.
	- May increase the infusion rate (max 0.5 mL/kg/min) if blood pressure remains low.
	- Continue the infusion for at least 10 minutes after achieving circulatory stability.
	- Recommended upper limit: 10 mL/kg over the first 30 minutes.
	- Note: Propofol is not a substitute for lipid emulsion.

##### Theories on Lipid Emulsion Mechanism

- **Lipophilicity Theory**: Local anaesthetics are lipophilic compounds. The lipid emulsion acts as a sump, decreasing the volume of distribution of the local anaesthetic by drawing it into the vascular compartment, thus limiting its concentration in target tissues.
- **Impairment of Mitochondrial Lipid Metabolism**:
	- Local anaesthetics bind to proteins, including carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (CAT), which helps transport fatty acids across mitochondrial membranes. These fatty acids are oxidized to provide energy for the heart.
	- If CAT is inhibited by local anaesthetics, free fatty acids are not fully oxidized, depleting myocardial ATP supply.
	- A large lipid load may overwhelm the inhibition of CAT, increasing the energy supply to the myocardium.
- **Cardiopulmonary Bypass (ECMO)**: If there is a failure to respond to lipid emulsion and vasopressor therapy, cardiopulmonary bypass should be instituted.
