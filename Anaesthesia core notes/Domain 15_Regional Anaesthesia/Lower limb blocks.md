## Hip Surgery

- **Lumbar paravertebral or lumbar plexus block**: Used when spinal or epidural anesthesia is contraindicated. It can provide complete analgesia of the lower limb when combined with a sciatic nerve block, especially useful in revision joint replacement where the surgery is likely to be prolonged.
- **Femoral nerve block**: Provides analgesia for fracture neck of femur, total hip replacement, and femoral shaft fracture.
- **Three-in-one block**: Targets the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, obturator nerve, and femoral nerve by injecting a large volume of local anesthetic within the neurovascular sheath, though its effectiveness can be inconsistent.
- **Fascia iliaca block**: A hybrid anterior lumbar plexus approach providing faster and more consistent blockade of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh and femoral nerve than the ‘three-in-one’ block.

## Knee Surgery

- **Femoral and sciatic nerve blocks**: Provide intraoperative and postoperative analgesia for knee joint surgery, improve early rehabilitation by effectively controlling pain compared to intravenous morphine via patient-controlled analgesia.
- **Psoas compartment block**: Provides anaesthesia and analgesia to the entire lumbar plexus, used for knee arthroscopy, though not commonly justified in ambulatory patients due to risks like epidural spread and weak hip flexors.
- **Femoral nerve block**: Covers the anteromedial thigh, anterior knee, and medial calf, making it one of the most common lower extremity blocks.
- **Intra-articular injection**: A combination of ropivacaine or levobupivacaine, adrenaline, morphine, and methylprednisolone, used increasingly for total knee replacement and sometimes for total hip replacement, though further studies are needed to determine the optimal volume and concentration of the drugs. An indwelling catheter can also be used for top-ups or continuous infusion, with a risk of infection.

## Ankle/Foot Surgery

- **Popliteal block**: Effective for foot and ankle surgery, often combined with a saphenous nerve block for medial foot and ankle involvement. Adequate for a calf tourniquet in conscious patients.
- **Sciatic and femoral nerve block**: Used if a thigh tourniquet is required during surgery, providing good surgical anesthesia and long-lasting postoperative pain control.
- **Popliteal sciatic nerve block combined with saphenous or femoral nerve block**: Allows use of a calf tourniquet and provides anesthesia comparable with neuraxial techniques, without urinary retention and with longer postoperative analgesia (12-24 hours with long-acting local anesthetics like ropivacaine or bupivacaine).
- **Ankle block**: Has minimal impact on postoperative ambulation while providing prolonged postoperative analgesia with long-acting local anesthetics. Ideal for avoiding foot drop, hamstring, or quadriceps weakness.
# Summary of All Blocks

## Suggested Standard Monitoring for Nerve Blocks

### Ultrasound + Nerve Stimulation + Opening Injection Pressure (OIP)

1. Connect needle to nerve stimulator (0.5mA, 0.1msec, 2Hz)
2. Advance needle towards the nerve or plexus
	- Needle adequately placed as seen on US
		- No twitch
		- 1-2 mL injection of LA results in adequate spread in the desired tissue plane OIP normal <15psi
	- Needle adequately placed as seen on US
		- Twitch present
		- Reposition the needle to assure NO twitch present at <0.5mA
			- 1-2 mL injection of LA results in adequate spread in the desired tissue plane OIP normal <15psi
3. Complete injection

- Increase current to 1.5mA
- Adjust needle placement by US
### Legend
- OIP normal (<15 psi): Based on data in both animal models and clinical trials where injection pressure required to inject local anesthetic for nerve or perineural exercise is <15 psi
