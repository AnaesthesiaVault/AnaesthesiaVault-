# Off-Label Prescription and Use

## Definition

Off-label prescription and/or use refers to the prescription or use of a medicine or medical device outside of its approved label. Off-label use of medicines may be indicated if sufficient evidence (defined as peer-reviewed acceptance of indication) exists for such use.

## Controversies

### Clinical
- **Risks to patient**
- **Risks to practitioner (malpractice)**

### Legal
- **Informed consent**
- **Regulatory framework**: Pharmaceutical companies distributing literature on off-label use is prohibited in SA.

### Ethical
- **Financial gain**
- **Protecting patient vs Professional Judgement**

## SASSA Guidelines
1. May be indicated if sufficient evidence exists.
2. Written informed consent for off-label use (OLU).
3. Informing the patient about the benefits, risks, and consequences of OLU.
4. Explanation to the patient if no alternative exists.
5. Practitioner shares legal liability with all others in the supply chain.
6. Best to use for indications for which the drug may be registered elsewhere.
7. Establish the recorded safety with the pharmaceutical company.

## Off-Label Vs Unlicensed Use
- **Off-label**: The use of licensed medications outside the conditions of the license.
- **Unlicensed**: Use of drugs that have not been approved by any licensing authority of a specific country.

# Drug Substitution

## Definitions
- **Generic substitution**: Substituting a different formulation of the same drug. All generic versions are considered equivalent to each other and to the originator drug.
- **Therapeutic substitution**: Replacing the originally prescribed drug with an alternative molecule with assumed equivalent therapeutic effect. The alternative drug may be within the same class or from another class with assumed therapeutic equivalence.

## Legal Framework
### The Medicines and Related Substances Act

Permits generic substitution within the criteria set by section 22F:

1. Pharmacists must inform patients of the benefits of the substitution.
2. When substituting, the pharmacist must take reasonable steps to inform the prescriber.
3. Pharmacists may dispense the generic instead of the prescribed medicine, unless:
   - Expressly forbidden by the patient to do so.
   - The prescriber has written "no substitution" next to the item prescribed.
   - The retail price of the generic is higher than that of the prescribed medicine.
   - The product has been declared not substitutable by the MCC.

**Therapeutic substitution** cannot take place unless a new and valid prescription is issued.

## Drugs Not Suited for Generics

Drugs should not be substituted if they:

1. Have a narrow therapeutic range (NTI).
2. Have been known to show erratic intraand interpatient responses.
3. Are contained in dosage forms that are likely to give rise to clinically significant bioavailability problems.
4. Are intended for the critically ill and/or geriatric and pediatric patients.

### FDA Regulations on NTI Drugs

Drugs are defined as having an NTI if:

- They have less than a 2-fold difference in median lethal dose and median effective dose values.
- They have less than a 2-fold difference in the minimum toxic concentrations and minimum effective concentrations in the blood.
- Safe and effective use of the drug products requires careful titration and patient monitoring.
