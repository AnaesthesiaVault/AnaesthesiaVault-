# Definitions

## Substance Abuse

Substance abuse is defined as the repeated, excessive, or inappropriate use of a mood-altering substance resulting in negative consequences in one or more life areas, where addiction cannot be diagnosed (M. Kaufmann, Medical Director, Ontario Medical Association Physician Health Programme, Toronto, Canada, personal communications and unpublished data).

## Addiction

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) defines addiction as a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry. Dysfunction in these circuits leads to characteristic biological, psychological, social, and spiritual manifestations. This is reflected in an individual pathologically pursuing reward and/or relief by substance use and other behaviors. Addiction is characterized by:

- Inability to consistently abstain
- Impairment in behavioral control
- Craving
- Diminished recognition of significant problems with one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships
- Dysfunctional emotional response

Like other chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse and remission (ASAM, 2011 reproduced with permission).

# Impaired Clinician

1. **Report** your concern to the relevant supervisor.
2. **Schedule** a formal meeting - be prepared for anger and denial.
3. **Offer the opportunity** to prove they do not have a problem by testing.
4. **Family involvement**.
5. **Rehabilitation program** - HPCSA regulations will determine if the clinician must not work and for how long.
6. **Step-wise reintegration**:
   - Return to Anaesthesia immediately vs. delayed vs. change specialty (Angres criteria).
   - Treat as a chronic disease → continuous surveillance.
# Substance Abuse in Anaesthetists

## Key Points

- Raising awareness and improving education about addiction have not decreased mortality or relapse rates.
- All grades of anaesthetists can abuse drugs, not just trainees.
- Substance dependence is recognized as a disease and should be treated accordingly.
- Delaying intervention until there is concrete evidence of substance abuse increases the risk of a tragic outcome.
- Each anaesthetic department should have a consultant responsible for members' welfare.

## Definitions

### Substance Abuse

Substance abuse is defined as the repeated, excessive, or inappropriate use of a mood-altering substance resulting in negative consequences in one or more life areas, where addiction cannot be diagnosed (M. Kaufmann, personal communications and unpublished data).

### Addiction

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) defines addiction as a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry. Dysfunction in these circuits leads to biological, psychological, social, and spiritual manifestations. Addiction is characterized by:

- Inability to consistently abstain
- Impairment in behavioral control
- Craving
- Diminished recognition of significant problems with one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships
- Dysfunctional emotional response

Like other chronic diseases, addiction involves cycles of relapse and remission (ASAM, 2011).

## Risk Factors

Risk factors for substance dependence include a family history of drug or alcohol dependence, childhood abuse, dysfunctional family environments, other mental health disorders, being male, early experimentation with drugs or alcohol, and peer influence. Specific risk factors for anaesthetists include direct contact with addictive drugs, daily exposure to potent opioids and sedatives, and easy access to drugs.

## Patterns of Substance Abuse

Anaesthetists commonly abuse:

- Intravenous opioids (fentanyl being the most common)
- Alcohol
- Marijuana
- Cocaine
- Hypnotics (midazolam)
- Oral opioids
- Anaesthetic agents (propofol, inhalation agents)

Notably, 15% of anaesthetic trainees used drugs before starting their training, and 22% abused more than one drug. A significant proportion of these cases involved fatalities.

## Signs of Substance Use

Indicators of substance abuse include:

- Decreased performance, unreliability, disorganization
- Unexplained absenteeism or lateness
- Requesting extra shifts, working alone, or preparing drugs for colleagues
- Physical symptoms like nasal rubbing, drowsiness, pallor, and sweating
- Behavioral changes such as avoiding social activities, poor record-keeping, and frequent minor injuries

## Intervention

Intervention involves addressing concerns about a doctor's behavior, presenting evidence of substance abuse, and formulating an action plan. Approaches should be non-judgmental, involve multiple people, and be conducted formally rather than in casual conversations. Offering assessments and tests can be part of the process, and patient safety must be prioritized. Immediate actions should include support from occupational health services and addiction specialists.

## Role of Medical Regulators

In the UK, the General Medical Council (GMC) regulates the medical profession. If patient harm has occurred, or there is substantial evidence of drug abuse, the GMC must be contacted, and the doctor may be suspended from work. The GMC focuses on whether the doctor shows insight into their problem and complies with treatment plans. Theft of drugs is treated as a consequence of addiction rather than a criminal act if the doctor is in recovery.

## Relapse

Relapse, the return to substance use after a period of abstinence, signifies unresolved issues and occurs in 2.6 years on average, with a 13% mortality rate. Effective monitoring and continued support are crucial to prevent relapse, with hair testing preferred for detecting substance use. The success rates for sustained abstinence in doctors are generally high, between 74% and 90%.

## Back to Work

Returning to work requires careful evaluation and gradual reintegration. The Angres Criteria provide guidelines for assessing the likelihood of returning to anaesthesia practice. Factors include commitment to recovery, family support, and absence of co-morbid psychiatric diagnoses. Simulation sessions and continuous support are beneficial for reintegration.

## Angres Criteria

- **Category I (Certain Return)**: Strong commitment to anaesthesia, understanding of addiction, involvement in recovery programs, strong family and employer support.
- **Category II (Possible Return)**: Relapsed but improving, some family dysfunction, partial involvement in recovery, mood swings without severe psychiatric issues.
- **Category III (Redirect to Another Specialty)**: Prolonged intravenous drug use, multiple relapses, active addiction, dysfunctional family, non-compliance with regulations, poor recovery skills, severe psychiatric diagnosis.

## UK Support Organizations

- **Practitioner Health Programme (PHP)**: A confidential NHS-funded service for doctors and dentists in London.
- **Sick Doctors Trust (SDT)**: A charity providing a 24-hour helpline and support for doctors with addiction issues.
- **British Doctors and Dentists Group (BDDG)**: A network of recovery groups for doctors and dentists across the UK.
