# Summary
### Perioperative Considerations for Robotic Surgery

#### 1. **Preoperative**
   - **Considerations:**
	 - Environmental considerations and ergonomics: May benefit from visiting other departments if new to robotics.
	 - Multi-disciplinary team training: Consider simulation.
   - **Rationale:**
	 - A proper ergonomic layout for table, robot, surgical, anaesthetic, and nursing teams is essential for safe and efficient care.  
	 - Robot setup and patient positioning take time and experience but can be efficient; critical incidents (e.g., cardiac arrest) require special consideration.

#### 2. **Induction**
   - **Considerations:**
	 - Preoperative assessment and multi-disciplinary decision-making regarding the benefits and risks of robotic surgery and anaesthetic technique.
	 - Induce on theatre table.
	 - Consider a second anaesthetic team for further patients.
	 - Consider opioid-based neuraxial block.
	 - Positioning of lines in the most accessible position, away from the robot.
	 - Invasive lines only in high-risk patients.
	 - Trial of positioning in high-risk patients.
   - **Rationale:**
	 - High-risk patients considered for minimally invasive surgery require special physiological considerations.
	 - Inducing on the theatre table avoids transfer and increases efficiency.
	 - Minimizes turnover time and improves robot utilisation efficiency.
	 - Evidence supports opioid-based neuraxial block for improved pain management.
	 - Improved ergonomics and accessibility reduce complications.

#### 3. **Maintenance**
   - **Considerations:**
	 - Nasogastric tube not always required.
	 - Attention to positioning and padding: Use gamgee for arms, and inflated gloves to protect hands. Protect the eyes with Lacrilube, padding, and Tegaderm.
	 - Shoulder supports and horizontal bars to protect the face from the robot arm.
	 - Consider TIVA approach.
	 - Maintain muscle paralysis (not required with remifentanil infusion).
	 - Restrictive fluid management where possible.
	 - Use a mobile phone app spirit level to measure Trendelenburg angle.
   - **Rationale:**
	 - Routine cases may be managed without invasive monitoring.
	 - Regurgitation may be absent in short low-risk cases.
	 - Peripheral nerve injury, compartment syndrome, and ocular complications (e.g., oedema) are possible.
	 - Protect the patient from robot arm movements.
	 - TIVA offers potential benefits, particularly in cancer management.
	 - Significant patient injury may occur once the robot is docked.
	 - Fluid restriction helps prevent oedema.
	 - Ensures accurate Trendelenburg positioning.
#### 4. **Emergence**
   - **Considerations:**
	 - Consider the degree of oedema.
	 - Cuff leak check, consider airway exchange catheter.
	 - Overnight intubation and dexamethasone in high-risk cases.
   - **Rationale:**
	 - Oedema is a particular concern in prolonged steep head-down surgery.
	 - Cuff leak checks aim to avoid difficult emergency re-intubation.
#### 5. **Postoperative**
   - **Considerations:**
	 - Enhanced recovery principles.
	 - Post-anaesthetic care unit/critical care for high-risk patients.
   - **Rationale:**
	 - Enhanced recovery principles consolidate the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, ensuring optimal outcomes, especially for high-risk or frail patients.
## Benefits
- Compared to standard laparoscopic surgery
	- (i) reduced wound access trauma
	- (ii) shorter hospital stay
	- (iii) improved visualisation
	- (iv) less postoperative wound complications (ranging from wound infections to incisional hernias)
	- (v) less disfigurement. As such they were designed to offer an equivalence to open surgery with less tissue trauma and speedier discharge that in turn was anticipated to offer
	- (vi) increased cost-efficacy.
## Considerations

### Anaesthetic Factors
- Spatial restriction reduces access to the patient.
- Ensuring complete immobility of the patient during the robotic procedure is essential.
- Physiological response to laparoscopic surgery (ie, pneumoperitoneum) must be addressed.
- Pain management is required.
### Surgical Factors
- Robotic docking requires the patient to be positioned correctly for accurate use of the robotic arms.
- Bulky robotic arms can cause damage to surrounding structures.
- Major haemorrhage can be insidious.
- Communication can be difficult whilst the surgeon is in the master console.
### Patient Factors
- Steep Trendelenburg position for prolonged duration can raise intracranial pressure and cause facial and orbital oedema.
- Risk of regurgitation is increased whilst in the steep Trendelenburg position.
- Risk of renal injury must be evaluated.
