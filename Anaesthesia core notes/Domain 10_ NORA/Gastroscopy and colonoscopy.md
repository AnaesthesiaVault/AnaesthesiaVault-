# New Sedation Drugs

## Remimazolam
- **Mechanism of Action**: Short-acting GABA-A receptor agonist with organ-independent metabolism.
- **Preclinical Findings**: Faster onset and shorter duration of action compared to midazolam.
- **Clinical Advantages**: Predictable onset and recovery; organ-independent metabolism.
- **Drawbacks**: Respiratory depressant effect similar to other benzodiazepines.

## Fospropofol
- **Mechanism of Action**: Water-soluble prodrug of propofol, metabolized in vivo to release propofol, phosphate, and formaldehyde.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Lower peak concentration and slower decline in drug concentration than propofol.
- **Advantages**: Avoids complications associated with lipid-based formulations and reduces risk of propofol level fluctuations from bolus injections.

## Methoxyflurane
- **Properties**: Formerly used as a volatile anesthetic, now recognized for strong analgesic properties.
- **Availability**: Sold as Penthrox® in South Africa, packaged as a single-use inhaler.
- **Administration**: Vaporized by inhalation via a propylene wick; inhaler features a dilutor hole for concentration control and a charcoal chamber to minimize environmental contamination.
- **Clinical Comparison**: Compared favorably to midazolam and fentanyl for colonoscopies, offering shorter recovery times and no respiratory depression. Not associated with impaired success or polyp detection.
- **Drawbacks**: Contraindicated in renal failure or impairment.

# Disease Processes Commonly Associated with Patients Presenting for Endoscopy

## Visceral Hypersensitivity
- **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: Characterized by abdominal pain and disturbed defecation without structural or biochemical abnormalities; involves increased sensitivity to gut stimuli.
- **Coeliac Disease**: Linked with higher rates of neuropsychiatric disturbances and visceral hypersensitivity, necessitating increased opioid and midazolam dosages compared to controls.

## Aortic Stenosis
- **Association**: Chronic gastrointestinal bleeding associated with calcific aortic stenosis (Heyde Syndrome).
- **Pathogenesis**: Acquired type IIA von Willebrand syndrome and angiodysplasia; high shear stress increases von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease activity, leading to proteolysis and platelet interactions.
- **Management**: Multidisciplinary approach; standard von Willebrand treatments ineffective. Options include estrogen-progesterone, thalidomide, blood transfusions, endoscopic interventions, and valve replacement (preferably bioprosthesis or transcatheter aortic valve implantation in suitable patients).

## Neuroendocrine Tumours (NETs)
- **Origin**: Malignant growths from neuroendocrine cells, commonly in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and pancreas.
- **Symptoms**: Functioning tumors secrete hormones like serotonin, causing flushing and diarrhea; Carcinoid syndrome occurs with systemic hormone circulation, often due to liver metastases.
- **Diagnosis**: Endoscopic ultrasonography is the most sensitive test for pancreatic NETs.

## Obesity
- **Associations**: Higher prevalence of gastrointestinal diseases and conditions such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension.
- **Sedation Risks**: Higher adipose mass, reduced total body water, higher glomerular filtration rate, and normal hepatic clearance can complicate pharmacokinetics and increase sedation risks.
- **Monitoring**: ASA guidelines recommend capnography for ventilation monitoring in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

## Renal Failure
- **Sedation**: Midazolam and fentanyl are safe for sedation in renal failure patients on dialysis.
- **Bowel Preparation**: Avoid oral sodium phosphate preparations (e.g., picolax®, picoprep®, coloprep®) in patients with chronic kidney disease or those on renal perfusion-affecting drugs. Prefer polyethylene glycol preparations (e.g., moviprep®, cleanprep®).

## Liver Failure
- **Necessity**: Diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy often required in chronic liver disease patients.
- **Drug Metabolism**: Liver dysfunction reduces clearance of sedative drugs metabolized by hepatic pathways; associated with reduced enzyme activity (e.g., CYP450).
- **Midazolam**: Delayed clearance in cirrhosis due to reduced conjugation and portal blood flow; risk of exacerbating hepatic encephalopathy.
- **Propofol**: Shorter biological half-life and lower hepatic encephalopathy risk in chronic liver disease patients.
