# Arterial Pressure Wave Forms

![[image-160-x38-y42.png]]

- It is the arterial pressure wave that is felt as the ‘radial pulse’, not the blood flow wave (pressure wave moves much faster than the blood flow)
**As you move more distal:**
- The arterial upstroke is steeper and SBP is increased. DBP is decreased. MAP is constant
- Dicrotic notch changes: The dicrotic notch is positioned further down the pressure curve. Rather than being a sharp interruption in the pressure descent, the dicrotic notch becomes more of a dicrotic wave.
