# # Flow Volume Loops
## Axes Representation

- **Y-axis**: Represents the flow rate.
	- Exhalation: Above the x-axis.
	- Inhalation: Below the x-axis.
- **X-axis**: Represents lung volume.
	- Volume decreases from left to right.
	- Starts at total lung capacity (left) and ends at residual volume (right).

## Loop Direction

- The flow volume loop begins on the left of the x-axis and follows a clockwise direction.

## Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)

- **Normal PEFR**:
	- **Men**: Averages between 440 and 740 L/min.
	- **Women**: Averages between 340 and 530 L/min.
- PEFR is located at the highest point on a flow volume loop.

## COPD

- PEFR usually decreases slightly so that the initial expiratory flow is not affected significantly. Instead of the almost linear decrease in expiratory flow, there is a “scooping” of the loop soon after the PEFR. This scooping represents the decreased amount of flow secondary to difficulty in expelling the volume of gases left in the distal airways.
- In severe COPD, the PEFR is affected more drastically. The expiratory flow does not come close to the flow of a normal subject.

## Intra Vs Extra Thoracic Obstruction

Intrathoracic obstruction affects expiratory flow

Extrathoracic obstruction affects inspiratory flow
