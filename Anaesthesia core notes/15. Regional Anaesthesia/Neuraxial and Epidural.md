# Spinal Anaesthesia

**Historical Background**  
Spinal anaesthesia was first performed by Augustus Karl Gustav Bier, a German surgeon, in 1898. He used intrathecal cocaine on six patients for lower extremity surgery. Afterward, Bier experimented on himself, resulting in a postdural puncture headache (PDPH), which prevented him from continuing. His assistant, Dr. Otto Hildebrandt, volunteered for the procedure. After the injection of spinal cocaine, Bier conducted experiments on Hildebrandt, including needle pricks, cigar burns, incisions, and other painful stimuli, to assess analgesia. Hildebrandt experienced minimal pain during the procedures but suffered from nausea, vomiting, PDPH, and other complications afterward. Bier attributed the PDPH to the loss of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and suggested that small-gauge needles could reduce the risk of this complication.

**Advancements in Needle Design**  
Barnett Greene introduced a 26-gauge spinal needle in obstetrics, which reduced the incidence of PDPH. This needle was widely used until the introduction of the Whitacre needle. Hart and Whitacre developed a pencil-point needle, decreasing the PDPH rate from 5%–10% to 2%. Later, Sprotte modified the Whitacre needle and conducted a trial with over 34,000 spinal anesthetics. Modifications of the Sprotte needle in the 1990s led to the design commonly used today.
## Advantages of Regional Anaesthesia versus General Anaesthesia

- **Reduction of Nausea and Vomiting**: Decreases the incidence postoperatively.
- **Decreased Stress Response**: Attenuates the physiological stress associated with surgery.
- **High-Quality Analgesia**: Effective both perioperatively and postoperatively, avoiding the systemic side effects associated with other analgesics.
- **Potential Pre-Emptive Analgesia**: May reduce sensitization of nerve endings after surgery, lowering the risk of chronic pain syndromes.
- **Earlier Discharge**: Patients can be discharged sooner due to improved analgesia and faster mobilization.
- **Reduction of Blood Loss**: Due to relative hypotension with central neural blockade.
- **Economic Benefits**: Lower costs for drugs and equipment, resulting in shorter hospital stays.
- **Enhanced Communication and Positioning**: Patients remain conscious during surgery, allowing for better positioning and cooperation.
- **Avoidance of Airway Instrumentation**: Beneficial for patients with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, where cervical movement should be minimized.
- **Reduced Environmental Exposure**: Less exposure to anaesthetic gases for both patients and healthcare staff.

## Specific Complications
### Cardiovascular Effects of Spinal Anaesthesia

**Mechanisms of Hypotension**  
Spinal anesthesia can induce hypotension through several mechanisms, primarily by blocking preganglionic sympathetic nerves. The height of the nerve block determines the extent of sympathetic blockade and the resultant changes in cardiovascular parameters, although this relationship is not always predictable. The sudden onset of sympathetic nerve block during spinal anesthesia leaves little time for cardiovascular compensation, which may explain why similar blocks with epidural anesthesia cause less hypotension.

**Impact on Cardiac Output and Systemic Vascular Resistance**  
- **Preload:** Sympathetic block-induced venodilation decreases preload by pooling blood in the peripheries and reducing venous return.
- **Afterload and SVR:** Arterial vasodilation caused by sympathetic block reduces afterload and SVR. Arterial vasodilation is not maximal after spinal block, as some autonomic tone remains in the vascular smooth muscle. However, this residual tone can be lost in the presence of hypoxia or acidosis, potentially leading to cardiovascular collapse.

**Heart Rate (HR) Effects**  
The effect of spinal anesthesia on HR is complex and can result in either an increase or decrease. Hypotension-induced by spinal anesthesia may trigger a baroreceptor reflex, increasing HR. Conversely, blocking the cardiac accelerator fibers from T1–T4 can decrease HR. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex (BJR), a cardioinhibitory reflex, has been implicated in bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse after spinal anesthesia, particularly in young, healthy patients.

**Risk Factors for Hypotension**  
Risk factors include hypovolemia, preoperative hypertension, high sensory nerve block, age over 40 years, obesity, combined general and spinal anesthesia, chronic alcohol consumption, high BMI, and emergency surgeries.

**Management of Hypotension**  
Coloading with crystalloid immediately after spinal anesthesia is more effective than preloading at preventing hypotension. Phenylephrine is the vasopressor of choice, especially in obstetric settings, although it may decrease cardiac output and spinal nerve block height.

### Other Effects

**Respiratory Effects**  
In patients with normal lung function, spinal anesthesia has minimal respiratory effects. However, high spinal blocks can impair active exhalation by paralyzing abdominal and intercostal muscles.

**Gastrointestinal Effects**  
Sympathetic innervation to the abdominal organs arises from T6 to L2. Spinal anesthesia causes sympathetic block and unopposed parasympathetic activity, leading to increased secretions, sphincter relaxation, and bowel constriction. Increased vagal activity can cause increased peristalsis, potentially leading to nausea. Gut ischemia from hypotension can also produce serotonin and other emetogenic substances, increasing the risk of intraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV).

**Hepatic and Renal Effects**  
Hepatic blood flow is directly correlated with arterial blood flow, with no autoregulation. Therefore, maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) is crucial to preserving hepatic perfusion during spinal anesthesia. Similarly, renal blood flow is autoregulated and remains adequate if MAP is above 50 mm Hg. Maintaining MAP close to baseline is essential for both hepatic and renal protection during spinal anesthesia.
### Minor Complications

**Nausea and Vomiting**  
Intraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV) can occur in up to 42% of non-obstetric surgeries and up to 80% in parturients. Causes include patient factors (e.g., anxiety, vagal hyperactivity), surgical factors (e.g., peritoneal traction), and anesthetic factors (e.g., hypotension, intrathecal additives).

**Shivering**  
Shivering occurs in about 55% of cases after neuraxial anesthesia. Although more common after spinal anesthesia, its intensity may be higher with epidurals. Prevention strategies include prewarming, using intrathecal fentanyl, meperidine, and intravenous ondansetron. Treatment options include intravenous meperidine, tramadol, or clonidine.

**Itch (Pruritis)**  
Pruritis is a common side effect of neuraxial opioids, particularly with intrathecal administration. It often affects the face and nose. Treatment options include naloxone and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists like ondansetron.

**Hearing Impairment**  
Hearing loss, particularly in the low-frequency range, has been reported after spinal anesthesia. Incidences vary widely.

**Postoperative Urinary Retention (POUR)**  
POUR is multifactorial and influenced by patient factors (e.g., male sex, previous urologic dysfunction), surgical factors (e.g., pelvic surgery), and anesthetic factors (e.g., use of anticholinergics, opioids). It is associated with neuraxial anesthesia due to neural interruption of the micturition reflex.

**Postdural Puncture Headache (PDPH)**  
PDPH is less common in elderly patients and those with higher BMI. It occurs more frequently with larger needles and is influenced by factors like female gender and previous PDPH. The risk with a Whitacre 27-gauge needle in obstetric patients is approximately 1.7%.

### Major Complications
- **Direct Needle Trauma:** Neurologic injury may result from needle introduction into spinal cord or nerves. Paresthesias during needle insertion may indicate proximity to neural tissue, with the potential for permanent damage if local anesthetic is injected.
- **Meningitis:** Potential sources include contaminated spinal trays, medication, and oral flora of the anesthesiologist.
- **Vertebral Canal Hematoma:** Hematomas can result from arterial or venous injury, leading to spinal cord ischemia.
- **Spinal Cord Ischemia:** This may occur due to prolonged hypotension, vasoconstrictors, or vertebral canal hematoma, affecting the anterior spinal artery.
- **Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES):** Associated with continuous spinal microcatheters and hyperbaric 5% lidocaine. Limiting the dose of local anesthetic may help prevent CES.
- **Arachnoiditis:** Inflammation of the arachnoid mater can be caused by infection, blood in the intrathecal space, or neurotoxic substances.
- **Total Spinal Anesthesia (TSA):** TSA results in respiratory depression, cardiovascular compromise, and loss of consciousness.

#### Estimating the Risks of Major Complications

Retrospective evidence from Finland (1987–1993) estimated the risk of a major complication following spinal anesthesia at 1 in 22,000. The risk of permanent harm from major complications ranges from 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 50,000, while the risk of death or paraplegia ranges from 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 150,000. The incidence of complications from spinals and caudals is lower than that of epidurals and combined spinal-epidural (CSE) nerve blocks.

## Functional Anatomy of Spinal Block

**Vertebral Column and Ligaments**  
The vertebral column comprises 33 vertebrae: 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 4 coccygeal. The column typically features three curves: cervical and lumbar curves are convex anteriorly, while the thoracic curve is convex posteriorly. Five ligaments hold the spinal column together:
- **Supraspinous Ligament:** Connects the apices of spinous processes from C7 to the sacrum.
- **Interspinous Ligaments:** Connect adjacent spinous processes.
- **Ligamentum Flavum:** Connects the laminae above and below.
- **Posterior and Anterior Longitudinal Ligaments:** Bind the vertebral bodies together.

**Membranes Protecting the Spinal Cord**  
Three membranes protect the spinal cord: dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. The dura mater, or "tough mother," is the outermost layer, extending to the second sacral vertebra (S2). The arachnoid mater, or "cobweb mother," is the middle layer, also ending at S2. The pia mater, or "soft mother," adheres closely to the spinal cord and ends in the filum terminale, anchoring the spinal cord to the sacrum. The subarachnoid space, located between the arachnoid and pia mater, contains CSF and spinal nerves.

**Anatomy Traversed During Spinal Anaesthesia**  
- **Midline Approach:** Skin → Subcutaneous fat → Supraspinous ligament → Interspinous ligament → Ligamentum flavum → Dura mater → Subdural space → Arachnoid mater → Subarachnoid space.
- **Paramedian Approach:** Skin → Subcutaneous fat → Paraspinous muscle → Ligamentum flavum → Dura mater → Subdural space → Arachnoid mater → Subarachnoid space.

**Special Considerations for the Subdural Space**  
The subdural space, located between the dura and arachnoid mater, extends from the cranial cavity to the second sacral vertebra. It is an acquired space, becoming apparent only after tearing of neurothelial cells. This space extends laterally around the dorsal nerve root and ganglion, with less potential capacity near the ventral nerve roots. This anatomical difference may contribute to the sparing of anterior motor and sympathetic fibers during a subdural nerve block (SDB).

**Surface Anatomy for Spinal Anaesthesia**  
- **Midline Identification:** The midline is identified by palpating the spinous processes. The iliac crests are at the level of the fourth lumbar spinous process or the L4–L5 interspace. The intercristal line, drawn between the iliac crests, helps locate the interspace.
- **Dermatome Levels for Common Surgeries:**  
   - Upper abdominal surgery: T4  
   - Intestinal, gynecologic, and urologic surgery: T6  
   - Transurethral resection of the prostate: T10  
   - Vaginal delivery and hip surgery: T10  
   - Thigh surgery and lower leg amputations: L1  
   - Foot and ankle surgery: L2  
   - Perineal and anal surgery: S2 to S5 (saddle block)

## Pharmacology of Local Anaesthetics

**Key Factors**  
- **Potency:** Related to lipid solubility—higher lipid solubility increases potency, allowing for effective anesthesia at lower concentrations.
- **Duration of Action:** Influenced by protein binding—higher protein binding results in a longer duration of action.
- **Onset of Action:** Related to the amount of local anesthetic available in its base form. Lower pKa values correspond to a faster onset of action.

**Pharmacokinetics in the Subarachnoid Space**  
The uptake of local anesthetics into neuronal tissue from the subarachnoid space depends on:
1. Concentration of the anesthetic in CSF
2. Surface area of nerve tissue exposed to CSF
3. Lipid content of nerve tissue
4. Blood flow to nerve tissue

**Mechanisms of Uptake**  
Local anesthetics are absorbed by nerve roots and the spinal cord. The spinal cord absorbs anesthetics via diffusion from the CSF and through the spaces of Virchow-Robin, which connect with perineuronal clefts and allow deeper penetration into the spinal cord. The distribution of local anesthetics is influenced by baricity, patient positioning, and dose.

**Elimination**  
Local anesthetics are eliminated through vascular absorption in the epidural and subarachnoid spaces. The rate of elimination varies based on blood flow and the specific local anesthetic used. For instance, tetracaine increases spinal cord blood flow, whereas lidocaine and bupivacaine decrease it.

**Determinants of Local Anaesthetic Spread**  
- **Properties of Local Anaesthetic Solution:** Baricity, dose, volume, specific gravity.
- **Patient Characteristics:** Position during and after injection, height, spinal column anatomy, and CSF volume.
- **Technique:** Injection site and needle bevel direction.

**Baricity and Patient Positioning**  
- **Hypobaric Solutions:** Less dense than CSF, tend to rise against gravity.
- **Isobaric Solutions:** Equal density to CSF, remain at the injection level.
- **Hyperbaric Solutions:** Denser than CSF, follow gravity after injection.

**Volume of the Lumbar Cistern and Nerve Block Height**  
Predicting the level of spinal block is challenging due to variability in CSF volume. The ability to predict the level of the block remains poor, even when using BMI as a factor.
### Local Anaesthetics in Spinal Anaesthesia

**Bupivacaine**  
Bupivacaine is one of the most commonly used local anesthetics for spinal anesthesia, particularly for surgeries of intermediate to long duration. It provides reliable anesthesia and has a low incidence of transient neurological symptoms (TNS). The onset of anesthesia occurs within 5 to 8 minutes, and the duration of anesthesia typically lasts between 90 and 150 minutes, making it suitable for a wide range of operating room cases.

**Lidocaine**  
Lidocaine’s use in spinal anesthesia is limited due to its association with TNS. However, it offers a rapid onset and shorter duration of action, which may be appropriate in select cases.

**Ropivacaine**  
Introduced in the 1990s, ropivacaine is less potent than bupivacaine but is still used for spinal anesthesia. Dose-finding studies have identified the effective dose for 95% of patients (ED95) in various populations:
- **Lower limb surgery:** 11.4 mg
- **Pregnant patients:** 26.8 mg
- **Neonates:** 1.08 mg/kg

### Additives to Local Anaesthesia

**Vasoconstrictors**  
Adding epinephrine or phenylephrine to local anesthetics can intensify and prolong anesthesia by producing tissue vasoconstriction. This effect reduces systemic reabsorption and keeps the anesthetic in contact with nerve fibers longer, extending the duration of the block. However, vasoconstrictors can cause ischemic complications, including an increased risk of cauda equina syndrome (CES) due to anterior spinal artery ischemia. Phenylephrine has also been associated with an increased risk of TNS and may reduce the height of the nerve block.

**α2-Adrenergic Agonists**  
Clonidine, an α2-adrenergic agonist, can enhance pain relief and prolong both sensory and motor blocks when added to spinal injections. It is particularly effective in enhancing postoperative analgesia for procedures such as cesarean deliveries, femoral fracture fixation, and knee arthroscopies. Clonidine works by hyperpolarizing neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, facilitating the action of local anesthetics and prolonging motor block. However, side effects include hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. Clonidine has also been used for treating intractable pain.

**Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors**  
Neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, produces analgesia when injected intrathecally by increasing acetylcholine levels and generating nitric oxide. However, its use is limited due to side effects such as nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, anxiety, restlessness, and lower extremity weakness. Despite providing extended pain control, these side effects restrict its widespread use.

#### SASRA Guidelines on Adjuvant Agents in Regional Anaesthesia

1. **Adrenaline**:
	
	- Prolongs the duration of the blockade when combined with lignocaine only.
2. **Clonidine**:
	
	- Extends the duration of analgesia and anaesthesia by approximately 2 hours when added to local anaesthetics for axillary and peribulbar blocks.
	- **Caution**: Evidence is inconclusive when clonidine is added to supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks or continuous catheter techniques.
	- **Side Effects**: Dose-independent systemic side effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation.
	- Clonidine in lignocaine intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA) delays tourniquet pain.
3. **Magnesium Sulphate**:
	
	- Improves intraand postoperative analgesia and tourniquet tolerance in lignocaine IVRA.
	- The long-term effects of perineural magnesium are unclear.
4. **Ketamine**:
	
	- Reduces pain when applied topically in oral mucositis.
	- Not recommended for addition to local anaesthetic agents.
5. **Alkalinisation**:
	
	- Addition of sodium bicarbonate is no longer recommended.
6. **Dexamethasone**:
	
	- Increases the duration of the blockade in peripheral nerve blocks depending on the site of administration, with the most benefit seen with long-acting blocks (50-240% increase).
	- The effect is similar if administered intravenously in doses of at least 10 mg.
7. **General Advice**:
	
	- Some adjuvant agents may be associated with potentially undesirable effects.
	- Increased risk of drug errors when combining these adjuvant agents with local anaesthetics.
#### Common Additives

Preservative-free morphine 50mcg to 250mcg *(>150mcg = high dose) = prolong postoperative analgesia for 18 to 24 hours. Risk benefit: puritis vs analgesia.

Recent reports indicate that 5mcg dexmedetomidine added to hyperbaric bupivacaine potentiates and prolongs spinal anaesthesia without any untoward effects on neonate and hence can be used when it is appropriate.

## Factors Affecting the Level of Spinal Block

The level of spinal block achieved during spinal anesthesia is influenced by four main categories of factors:

1. **Characteristics of the Local Anesthetic Solution:**
   - **Baricity:** The density of the anesthetic relative to CSF significantly affects block spread. Hypobaric solutions tend to rise, hyperbaric solutions settle with gravity, and isobaric solutions remain at the injection level.
   - **Dose and Concentration:** Higher doses and concentrations typically result in a more extensive block.
   - **Volume Injected:** Larger volumes can increase the spread of anesthesia.

2. **Patient Characteristics:**
   - **Age:** Older patients may have an increased nerve block height, although this is not a reliable predictor on its own.
   - **Weight and Height:** These factors influence the distribution of the anesthetic.
   - **Intra-abdominal Pressure:** Increased pressure, as seen in obesity or pregnancy, can affect the spread of the block.
   - **Spinal Fluid Characteristics and Anatomy of the Spinal Column:** Variations in CSF volume and spinal anatomy (e.g., kyphosis, scoliosis) can impact the block level.
   - **Patient Position:** Position during and after the injection is crucial, especially with hyperbaric and hypobaric solutions.

3. **Technique of Spinal Block:**
   - **Site of Injection:** The interspace used for injection affects the level of anesthesia.
   - **Speed of Injection:** Though evidence is conflicting, a slow, smooth injection is generally recommended.
   - **Needle Bevel Direction:** Aligning the bevel longitudinally can reduce PDPH.
   - **Force of Injection:** Affects the initial distribution of the anesthetic.
   - **Addition of Vasoconstrictors:** These can prolong the duration but may also affect the distribution and side effects of the block.

4. **Diffusion:** The rate and extent of anesthetic diffusion through the CSF influence block height and duration.

## Equipment for Spinal Anesthesia

**Skin Preparation Solutions:**  
- The ideal solution is bactericidal, with a quick onset and long duration. Chlorhexidine is preferred over povidone iodine due to these properties. However, bactericidal agents are neurotoxic, so low concentrations should be used, and the solution must be allowed to dry before proceeding.

**Needles:**  
- **Pencil-Point Needles (Sprotte, Whitacre):** These have rounded, non-cutting tips and provide better tactile feedback but require more insertion force. They are associated with a lower risk of PDPH when the bevel is aligned longitudinally.
- **Cutting Bevel Needles (Quincke, Pitkin):** These needles have sharp points that may increase the risk of PDPH.
- **Introducers:** Used to assist in placing small-bore spinal needles and prevent contamination with epidermal tissue, which can reduce the risk of dermoid tumors.

## Approaches to Spinal Anesthesia

**Paramedian (Lateral) Approach:**  
- Used when the midline approach is difficult due to calcified ligaments or limited spine flexion. The needle is inserted 1 cm lateral to the spinous process, with a slight medial angulation to reach the subarachnoid space.

**Taylor Approach:**  
- A paramedian approach targeting the L5–S1 interspace, often used when other methods fail. The needle is inserted 1 cm medial and inferior to the posterior superior iliac spine and angled medially and cephalad.

## Managing Difficult or Failed Spinal Anesthesia

**Failure of Spinal Block:**  
- Failures can occur due to issues with lumbar puncture, solution injection, solution spread in the CSF, drug action on the nerves, or patient management. Correct positioning, anatomical landmark identification, and experience are crucial for successful neuraxial blocks.

**Failed Injection or Spread:**  
- Causes include loss of injectate during connection or into adjacent tissues, spinal deformities, septae, stenosis, or extradural cysts. Changes in patient position or repeating the block with adjustments are possible remedies, but care must be taken to avoid excessive spread or accumulation of anesthetic.

**Inadvertent Subdural Nerve Block:**  
- This occurs when the needle unintentionally enters the subdural space. It may present as a high sensory block with motor and sympathetic sparing, or more severe symptoms like respiratory insufficiency or unconsciousness. The block usually resolves within 2 hours.

**Unilateral Spinal Nerve Block:**  
- Preferred in elderly trauma patients or outpatient surgeries, unilateral spinal anesthesia offers better hemodynamic stability. For elderly patients, a hypobaric solution with the operative side up is used, while in outpatient settings, hyperbaric bupivacaine with the operative side down is recommended. A slow injection rate is critical to achieving a unilateral block.

## Anticoagulation & Peripheral Nerve Blocks

Peripheral nerve blocks can be performed in patients taking anticoagulants, although no prospective studies have been conducted in this context. The ASRA guidelines for neuraxial procedures are generally recommended for peripheral nerve blocks as well. However, the European Society of Anaesthesiology suggests that the guidelines for neuraxial blocks may not routinely apply to peripheral nerve blocks. In particular, the Austrian Society for Anesthesiology, Resuscitation and Intensive Care notes that superficial nerve blocks can be safely performed with residual anticoagulation.

**Risks:** Cases of psoas and retroperitoneal hematomas have been reported following lumbar plexus and psoas compartment nerve blocks in patients on anticoagulants, despite adherence to ASRA guidelines. Symptoms include pain, tenderness, declining hemoglobin/hematocrit, hypotension, and sensory-motor deficits. Diagnosis is confirmed via CT, with ultrasound as a secondary tool.

**Treatment:** Treatment options include surgical consultation, anticoagulation reversal, blood transfusion, and possibly surgical drainage.

### Summary

- The guidelines for neuraxial injections should also be applied to lumbar plexus nerve blocks and visceral sympathetic nerve blocks.
- For superficial nerve blocks, ultrasound-guided regional blocks may be safely performed in the presence of residual anticoagulation.
# Epidural
## Epidural Anaesthesia

Epidural anesthesia is a neuraxial technique that can provide significant benefits in the perioperative period. It is particularly useful for reducing the surgical stress response, potentially lowering the risk of cancer recurrence, decreasing the incidence of perioperative thromboembolic events, and possibly reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with major surgeries.

### Lumbar Epidural Block

Epidural anesthesia is most commonly used for surgeries involving the lower limbs, pelvis, perineum, and lower abdomen. However, it is increasingly employed as the sole anesthetic or in combination with general anesthesia (GA) for a broader range of procedures.

## Cardiac Surgery and Thoracic Epidural Anesthesia (TEA)

High thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA), particularly blocking the upper five thoracic segments, has garnered interest as an adjunct to general anesthesia in cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Proposed benefits of TEA include:

- Improved coronary blood flow distribution
- Reduced myocardial oxygen demand
- Enhanced regional left ventricular function
- Lower incidence of supraventricular arrhythmias
- Attenuation of the surgical stress response
- Improved intraoperative hemodynamic stability
- Faster recovery of consciousness
- Enhanced postoperative analgesia
- Reduced incidence of postoperative renal and pulmonary complications

However, TEA is associated with the risk of epidural hematoma, especially in patients requiring full heparinization for CPB. The evidence supporting TEA in cardiac surgery is not conclusive. For example, a study by Liu et al. showed a reduction in postoperative cardiac arrhythmias and pulmonary complications with TEA compared to opioid-based GA for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with CPB, although it did not demonstrate differences in mortality or myocardial infarction rates. A more recent randomized controlled trial comparing fast-track GA with and without TEA in over 600 elective cardiac surgery patients found no significant differences in 30-day survival, postoperative complications, or recovery metrics between the groups. As a result, the role of TEA as an adjunct to GA in cardiac surgery remains controversial.

### Myasthenia Gravis (MG)

Patients with Myasthenia Gravis present specific challenges during anesthesia, including abnormal reactions to depolarizing and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, difficulty reversing residual neuromuscular block in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors, and increased risk of prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation. Additionally, these patients are at a heightened risk for postoperative respiratory failure and have unique postoperative pain management concerns.

Epidural anesthesia is beneficial in patients with MG as it eliminates the need for intraoperative muscle relaxants and provides superior postoperative pain relief compared to opioids. This approach minimizes the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression and pulmonary dysfunction, which are significant concerns in this population.

Given that ester local anesthetic (LA) metabolism may be prolonged in patients on cholinesterase inhibitors, the use of amide LAs is preferred. Reduced doses of LAs may also be appropriate. Concerns about compromising respiratory function with a high epidural block in myasthenic patients appear to be unfounded.

### Autonomic Hyperreflexia (AH)

Autonomic Hyperreflexia is a condition that occurs in up to 85% of patients with spinal cord injuries at or above the T4–T7 levels due to uninhibited sympathetic activity. In these patients, visceral or cutaneous stimulation below the level of the lesion can lead to extreme sympathetic hyperactivity, resulting in intense vasoconstriction below the lesion and vasodilation above it.

Symptoms of AH include sweating, nausea, flushing, pallor, shivering, nasal obstruction, blurred vision, headache, difficulty breathing, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias, with reflex bradycardia occurring in most cases. Severe hypertension can result in life-threatening complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage, myocardial ischemia, pulmonary edema, and death.

Epidural anesthesia can be used to manage AH, either as the sole anesthetic or as a supplement to general anesthesia (GA). Epidural blocks can attenuate the physiological disturbances associated with AH; however, incomplete blockade of sacral segments or missed segments may result in a high failure rate. Spinal anesthesia, which blocks the afferent limb of the reflex, and deep GA are generally more reliable in preventing AH.

### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

Epidural anesthesia is considered a reasonable option for patients with COPD undergoing major surgery due to concerns about prolonged mechanical ventilation. Although it is not definitively known whether epidural techniques reduce pulmonary complications in COPD patients, evidence suggests potential benefits.

A recent propensity-controlled analysis involving over 500 COPD patients undergoing abdominal surgery found that epidural analgesia as an adjunct to GA was associated with a statistically significant reduction in postoperative pneumonia risk. Patients with the most severe COPD benefitted the most. There was also a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in 30-day mortality with epidural analgesia, a finding echoed in other studies.

### Pediatric Surgery

The use of regional anesthesia in pediatric surgery has several advantages, particularly in extensive scoliosis repair, pectus excavatum repair, and major abdominal and thoracic procedures. Benefits include optimal postoperative analgesia, reduced GA requirements, earlier awakening, and quicker discharge in ambulatory settings.

Certain pediatric patients, such as those with cystic fibrosis, a family history of malignant hyperthermia, or a history of prematurity, also benefit from neuraxial anesthesia instead of GA. However, challenges include parental refusal, concerns about performing regional nerve blocks in anesthetized patients, and airway management in patients with limited oxygen reserves.

### Labor Analgesia and Anesthesia

Epidural analgesia is most commonly used in laboring parturients. For adequate pain relief during the first stage of labor, coverage of the T10 to L1 dermatomes is necessary. During the second stage of labor, analgesia should extend caudally to S2–S4 to include the pudendal nerve. Epidural placement at the L3–L4 interspace is typical.

However, identifying surface anatomic landmarks in obstetric patients can be challenging due to anterior pelvic rotation and exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Additional factors affecting epidural placement and the spread of LAs in parturients include engorgement of epidural veins, elevated hormonal levels, and excessive weight gain.

## Anatomy and Physiology

### Vertebral Column

**General Appearance**  
The vertebral column is composed of a total of 33 vertebrae: seven cervical, 12 thoracic, five lumbar, five fused sacral, and three to five (most commonly four) fused coccygeal vertebrae. When viewed from the front or back, the vertebral column appears straight. From the side, however, the cervical and lumbar regions display concave posterior curves (lordosis), while the thoracic and sacral regions exhibit concave anterior curves (kyphosis).

The four physiological spinal curves are typically fully developed by the age of 10 and become more pronounced with aging and during pregnancy. In the supine position, the C5 and L3 vertebrae represent the highest points of lordosis, whereas the peaks of kyphosis are found at T5 to T7 and S2.

### Preganglionic Sympathetic Nerve Fibers

Preganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers originate from the spinal cord between the T1 and L2 vertebrae and are variably blocked during epidural anesthesia. These fibers exit the spinal cord alongside spinal nerves and contribute to the formation of the sympathetic chain, which extends along the anterolateral aspects of the vertebral bodies for the entire length of the spinal column. This chain gives rise to the stellate ganglion, splanchnic nerves, and the celiac plexus, among other structures.

Blocking the sympathetic nervous system with epidural anesthesia has both benefits and drawbacks. For example, thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) can increase gastrointestinal (GI) motility by blocking the sympathetic supply to the inferior mesenteric ganglia, potentially reducing the incidence of postoperative ileus. Additionally, epidural anesthesia can modulate the systemic stress response to surgery by partially blocking the sympathetic nervous system. However, midto low-thoracic sympathetic block may cause significant dilation of the splanchnic vascular beds, increasing venous capacitance, decreasing preload to the right heart, and leading to other adverse effects.

### Epidural Space

The epidural space surrounds the dura mater circumferentially and extends from the foramen magnum to the sacrococcygeal ligament. The space is bound by the ligamentum flavum posteriorly, the pedicles and intervertebral foramina laterally, and the posterior longitudinal ligament anteriorly. The posterior epidural space is of greatest clinical relevance among the three compartments (posterior, lateral, and anterior) within the epidural space.

The epidural space contains adipose tissue, blood vessels, nerve roots, and loose connective tissue, though their distribution is nonuniform. The veins in the epidural space are continuous with the iliac vessels in the pelvis and the azygos system in the abdominal and thoracic walls. As these veins are valveless, blood can flow into the epidural vessels from any of the connected systems.

Contrary to traditional belief, most epidural vessels are found in the anterior epidural space, largely confined by the membranous extension of the posterior longitudinal ligament. This area is a common site for blood vessel puncture during epidural catheterization. Additionally, the subatmospheric pressure of the epidural space decreases significantly in the lumbar region, which may influence the efficacy of the hanging-drop and epidural pressure waveform techniques used to identify the epidural space.

The increased adipose tissue in the lower lumbar region, where the dural sac tapers, can contribute to variable effects of local anesthetic (LA) injections below the L4-L5 level. Moreover, adipose tissue within the midline gap, where the ligamentum flava fuse, may alter the tactile sensation typically experienced during the loss of resistance (LOR) technique.

#### Distance from Skin to Epidural Space

The depth from the skin to the epidural space varies depending on the level of the spine. The depth is greatest at the C6 to T1 levels, with a mean depth of 5.7 cm, possibly due to the presence of fatty tissue (the so-called hump pad) in this area. In the midthoracic region, the depth to the epidural space is influenced primarily by the sharp caudal angle of the spinous processes. As a result, the paramedian approach is often preferred for midthoracic epidural placement due to the steep angle and bony impediments.

Studies on the depth to the epidural space at the lumbar level, particularly in parturients, have reported a range of 2 to 9 cm, with 89% of cases falling within the 3.5–7.5 cm range. Earlier studies, such as that by Sutton and Linter, found that the skin to epidural space distance in 3011 parturients was 4 to 6 cm in 76% of participants. Patients with a shallow depth of 2 to 4 cm, comprising 16% of the study population, were found to have a threefold higher risk of unintentional dural puncture.

## Adjuvants to Local Anesthetics in the Epidural Space

The administration of adjuvants such as clonidine in the epidural space can offer several potential benefits, including:

1. **Prolongation and Enhancement of Effects:** Clonidine can extend the duration and intensify the effects of epidural local anesthetics (LAs) without a significant risk of hypotension.
2. **Reduction in LA Dose Requirements:** It helps in reducing the required dose of LAs for labor epidural analgesia.
3. **Effective Analgesia Without Motor Impairment:** Clonidine provides analgesia while preserving motor function.
4. **Synergistic Effect with Opioids:** It works synergistically with opioids and opioid agonist-antagonists to enhance analgesia.
5. **Modulation of the Stress Response:** Clonidine modulates the stress response during thoracic surgery.
6. **Preservation of Lung Function:** It helps maintain lung function following thoracotomy.
7. **Reduction in Cytokine Response:** Clonidine may reduce the cytokine response, further diminishing pain sensitivity.

However, common side effects of epidural clonidine include dose-independent hypotension, bradycardia, sedation, and dry mouth. When combined with other agents such as opioids, anticholinergics, and ketamine, the beneficial effects of these drugs may be enhanced while minimizing adverse side effects.

### Other Factors Affecting Epidural Block Injection Site

The effectiveness of an epidural block is optimized when the block or catheter is placed in a location that corresponds to the dermatomes affected by the surgical incision. The onset and intensity of the block are most pronounced at the site of injection. By positioning the catheter closer to the surgical site's dermatomal distribution, a lower dose of the drug can be administered, thereby reducing the risk of side effects.

- **Lumbar Epidural Injection:** Anesthetic effects spread more cranially than caudally, with delayed onset at the L5–S1 segments due to the larger size of these nerve roots.
- **Thoracic Injection:** The local anesthetic spreads evenly from the site of injection but encounters resistance in the lumbar region due to larger nerve roots. Controlling the dose in the thoracic region can create a true segmental block, sparing the lumbar and sacral regions and avoiding extensive sympathetic block, hypotension, bladder dysfunction, and lower limb motor block.

## Epidural Needles and Catheters

- **Epidural Needles:** The standard adult epidural needle is typically 17 or 18 gauge and 9 cm in length, with surface markings at 1-cm intervals. For obese patients, longer needles up to 15 cm are available. The Tuohy needle, commonly supplied in non-custom kits, features a curved tip with a blunt bevel, facilitating tissue identification and catheter passage. The wings at the junction of the needle shaft and hub provide better control during insertion.
- **Epidural Catheters:** Commercially prepared kits usually pair 19-gauge catheters with 17-gauge needles and 20-gauge catheters with 18-gauge needles. Many modern epidural catheters are made of nylon blends with varying stiffness to facilitate threading. Some stiff nylon catheters have flexible tips designed to avoid veins, nerves, and other obstacles in the epidural space.
- **Wire-Reinforced Epidural Catheters:** These catheters may reduce complications associated with epidural techniques, such as epidural vein cannulation, paresthesias, and inadequate analgesia. Current data indicate that clinical outcomes are similar whether uniport or multiport spring-wound catheters are used, as the flexibility provided by the stainless steel coil in these catheters negates potential benefits of a multiport design.

| Shorter distance from skin to epidural space                                   |
| Greater cephalad spread of hypobaric solutions                                 |

### Techniques to Identify the Epidural Space

There are three recognized techniques for identifying the epidural space: Loss of Resistance (LOR), Hanging Drop, and Ultrasonography.

- **Loss of Resistance to Air:** This technique, while widely used, is associated with complications such as pneumocephalus, an increased risk of accidental dural puncture (ADP), and a higher incidence of post-dural puncture headache (PDPH). The compressibility of air can lead to a false LOR, contributing to incomplete or patchy blocks, and can cause nerve root compression, venous air embolism, and other complications.
- **Loss of Resistance to Saline (With or Without an Air Bubble):** This technique involves filling the syringe with 2–3 mL of saline, with or without a visible air bubble. The air bubble acts as a pressure gauge, compressing and providing resistance if the needle tip is engaged in ligament, but dissipating effortlessly upon entry into the epidural space.
- **Hanging Drop Technique:** This method relies on the subatmospheric pressure of the epidural space, which is more pronounced in the cervical and thoracic regions. A drop of saline is placed at the hub of the needle, and the needle is advanced continuously until entry into the epidural space is signaled by the drop being "sucked in." The technique is most effective in the thoracic region but carries a higher risk of meningeal tear due to the proximity of the needle to the dura. It may not be appropriate for patients with severe obstructive lung disease due to attenuated subatmospheric pressure.

#### Complications Associated with Loss of Resistance to Air

| **Complication**                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Pneumocephalus                                        |
| Increased risk of accidental dural puncture           |
| Faster onset of signs and symptoms of PDPH            |
| Higher incidence of PDPH                              |
| Incomplete/patchy block                               |
| Spinal cord or nerve root compression by air          |
| Venous air embolism                                   |
| Subcutaneous emphysema                                |
| Increased incidence of epidural vein cannulation      |
| Difficult catheter insertion                          |

#### Midline Gaps in the Ligamentum Flavum

Midline gaps in the ligamentum flavum are not uncommon, especially in obstetric patients, who may also have softer ligaments. The depth from the skin to the ligamentum flavum generally ranges from 4 to 6 cm in normal-sized adults, but this can vary significantly. After penetrating the ligaments, it is not advisable to change the direction of the needle tip without first withdrawing the needle several centimeters or to the skin level. The stylet should always be reinserted into the epidural needle while redirecting to avoid the accumulation of bony debris or soft tissue plugs, which could obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) if an accidental dural puncture (ADP) occurs.

### Catheter Insertion and Management

- **Catheter Insertion:** The epidural catheter should be inserted with the help of an insertion device that fits into the epidural needle hub until the 15-cm mark is visualized entering the hub. Once the catheter is in place, the needle should be carefully removed without dislodging the catheter.
  
- **Catheter Depth:** The catheter should be threaded 5–6 cm into the epidural space for most procedures, while 2–3 cm may be sufficient for shorter surgeries. To determine where the catheter should be secured at the skin, add 2–6 cm (depending on the length of catheter threaded into the epidural space) to the previously calculated depth to the epidural space. For example, if the needle entered the epidural space at a depth of 7 cm, the catheter should be secured at the 12-cm mark to ensure that 5 cm of the catheter rests within the epidural space.

### Paramedian Approach

The paramedian approach provides a larger entry into the epidural space than the midline approach and is especially useful in patients who cannot easily be positioned or flex their spine during epidural placement. It is also advantageous in patients with calcified ligaments, spinal deformities (e.g., kyphoscoliosis, prior lumbar surgery), and for epidural techniques in the lowto mid-thoracic region. The spinous processes from T4 to T9 are sharply angled and point caudally, making midline insertion of the epidural needle more challenging.

- **Technique:**
  1. Identify the intended interspace using surface landmarks, palpation, or ultrasound guidance. Raise a skin wheal approximately 1 cm lateral and 1 cm caudad to the inferior aspect of the superior spinous process of the desired spinal level.
  2. Insert the epidural needle 15° off the sagittal plane, angled toward the midline with a cephalad tilt.
  3. If bone is encountered (most likely the lamina if the depth and angle are correct), redirect the needle in a cephalad and medial direction. If the lateral aspect of the spinous process is encountered, redirect the needle laterally and cephalad.

### Taylor Approach

The Taylor approach is a modified paramedian technique utilizing the large L5–S1 interspace. This approach is particularly useful for hip or lower extremity surgery in trauma patients who cannot tolerate the sitting position, and it may be the only viable option for accessing the epidural space in patients with ossified ligaments.

- **Technique:**
  1. With the patient in the sitting or lateral position, raise a skin wheal 1 cm medial and 1 cm caudad to the posterior superior iliac spine.
  2. Insert the epidural needle into this site at a 45° to 55° angle in a medial and cephalad direction.
  3. The first resistance felt should be on entry into the ligamentum flavum before entering the epidural space. If the needle contacts bone (usually the sacrum), walk the needle off the bone into the ligament and then into the epidural space, adjusting the angle as necessary.

### Initiation and Management of Epidural Block

- **Test Dose:**  
  Before administering medications through the epidural catheter, it is crucial to rule out subarachnoid, intravascular, and subdural placement. Catheter migration can occur even after initial confirmation of proper placement, so each bolus should be preceded by confirming the catheter’s location. A pharmacologic test dose, although debated, is commonly used and consists of 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine with 15 μg of epinephrine. A significant motor block suggests intrathecal placement, while a 20% or greater change in heart rate within one minute suggests intravascular placement, necessitating catheter replacement.

- **Dosing Regimen:**  
  After confirming proper catheter placement with a negative test dose, the catheter can be dosed to provide analgesia or anesthesia. The concentration of the local anesthetic (LA) determines the density of the block, while the volume and total dose determine its spread.

  - **Initial Loading Dose:**
	- For lumbar epidural: 1–2 mL of LA per segment to be blocked.
	- For thoracic epidural: 0.7 mL per segment.
	- For caudal epidural: 3 mL per segment.

	The loading dose should be administered incrementally (3to 5-mL aliquots at 3to 5-minute intervals) to monitor the patient's response and avoid systemic toxicity. For postoperative analgesia, 10 mL of 0.2%–0.25% bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, or ropivacaine may be used. Higher volumes of lower-concentration LAs may improve spread and analgesia, while higher-concentration LAs are needed for surgical anesthesia.

- **Maintenance of Anesthesia:**  
  After the initial loading dose, anesthesia can be maintained via intermittent boluses or continuous infusion. Continuous infusion rates typically range from 4 to 15 mL/h, depending on factors such as age, weight, the extent of sensory or motor block desired, catheter insertion site, and LA type and dose.

  For thoracic epidural blocks, several dosing regimens can be used to minimize hemodynamic changes and respiratory impairment in awake patients. An initial dose of 3 to 6 mL of dilute bupivacaine (0.125%–0.25%) or ropivacaine (0.1%–0.2%) with or without an opioid (e.g., fentanyl, hydromorphone) can be followed by 3 mL of 0.25%–0.5% bupivacaine every 30 minutes.

- **Top-Up Dosing:**  
  Repeat doses, or "top-ups," should be given before the block recedes more than two dermatomes. One-quarter to one-third of the original loading dose is typically administered, though adjustments may be needed based on clinical scenarios. For instance, if the block is unilateral or patchy and the patient desires to maintain motor strength, a high-volume, low-concentration LA top-up may be appropriate. Conversely, for denser blocks required for surgical anesthesia, a lower volume of higher-concentration LA may be necessary.

#### Paresthesias During Epidural Needle or Catheter Placement

- **Prevention:** Threading the catheter no more than 5–6 cm into the epidural space appears to reduce the risk of paresthesias. The use of flexible catheters, especially wire-reinforced catheters, also reduces the incidence of paresthesias.
- **Management:** If a paresthesia is transient, it is generally acceptable to continue advancing the needle or threading the catheter.

## Definition of Failure

Failure of spinal anaesthesia is defined as the inability to achieve satisfactory conditions for surgery despite an attempted spinal anesthetic. This failure can manifest across a spectrum:

- **Total Failure:** Complete absence of any neuraxial block.
- **Partial Failure:** Development of a neuraxial block that is inadequate in height, duration, or quality to allow the surgical procedure to proceed.

### Phases of the Spinal Anaesthesia Process

To understand and prevent failure, the spinal anaesthesia procedure can be broken down into five distinct phases. Analyzing the potential issues and success factors at each phase is crucial:

1. **Lumbar Puncture:** Proper technique and correct identification of the subarachnoid space.
2. **Injection of Local Anaesthetic:** Ensuring accurate placement and appropriate volume/concentration of the local anesthetic solution.
3. **Spread of Solution through CSF:** Adequate distribution of the anesthetic agent in the cerebrospinal fluid to achieve the desired block level.
4. **Drug Action on Neural Tissue:** Effective interaction of the anesthetic with neural tissues to produce the desired sensory and motor block.
5. **Patient Management:** Proper positioning and monitoring of the patient to optimize the block and manage any complications.
## Reasons for Failure
### 1. Unsuccessful Lumbar Puncture

The most apparent cause of failure in spinal anaesthesia is the inability to successfully access the subarachnoid space. This can occur due to several factors:

- **Incorrect Needling Technique:** Operator-dependent and often related to experience.
- **Poor Patient Positioning:** Also operator-dependent and modifiable with proper technique.
- **Anatomical Abnormalities:** These include scoliosis, kyphosis, vertebral collapse, calcified ligaments, or obesity. These conditions, particularly in the geriatric population, can increase the difficulty of lumbar puncture. However, good positioning and clinical experience can often mitigate these challenges.
- **Equipment-related Factors:** Issues such as a lack of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow despite correct needle placement could be due to a blocked needle lumen, either from manufacturing defects or obstruction by clot or tissue.

**NYSORA Tips:**

- Visually check the needle and stylet before starting the procedure.
- If CSF flow is absent despite apparent needle placement, consider a needle blockage and perform a "flush test" by withdrawing the needle and assessing its patency.
- Positioning Tip: Asking the patient to "try to touch their knees with their chin" can facilitate spine flexion, aiding in needle passage into the epidural or subarachnoid space.

### 2. Pseudosuccessful Lumbar Puncture

In rare instances, clear fluid not originating from CSF may mimic successful lumbar puncture. This can happen in scenarios such as:

- **Epidural Space Local Anesthetic Reservoirs:** Seen in obstetric practice during a cesarean section or after lumbar plexus block.
- **Congenital Arachnoid Cysts:** Tarlov cysts, present in 4.5%–9% of the population, may produce fluid similar to CSF, potentially leading to failed spinal anaesthesia.

Traditional bedside glucose testing is not definitive for distinguishing such fluids from CSF, as epidural space fluids rapidly equilibrate with extracellular fluid. The clinical relevance of failed spinal anaesthesia due to "false CSF" from arachnoid cysts remains uncertain.

### 3. Dose Selection

The dose of local anesthetic selected plays a crucial role in the duration and quality of the spinal block:

- **Therapeutic Range:** Selecting a dose within the therapeutic range primarily affects block duration rather than height. Factors influencing dose selection include the type of local anesthetic, solution baricity, patient positioning, and surgical requirements.
- **Single-Shot Spinal Anaesthesia:** Failure of this technique is distressing and increases patient morbidity. Therefore, doses used in practice often exceed the minimum required.
- **Low-Dose Spinal Anaesthesia:** Studies suggest that lower doses (5–10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine, instead of 15 mg) can achieve effective block, reducing hypotension and aiding in faster postoperative recovery. However, this approach requires the entire volume of the syringe to be delivered successfully into the subarachnoid space, with any loss potentially leading to ineffective anesthesia.

**NYSORA Tips:**

- Aspirate 0.5-1 ml of CSF before injection to confirm subarachnoid placement.
- Aspirate the same volume after injection to ensure the needle remained in the subarachnoid space throughout the procedure. Re-inject the aspirated fluid before withdrawing the needle.

### 4. Inadequate Intrathecal Spread

Even with proper delivery of the injectate, the spread of the solution within the CSF can be unpredictable. Factors affecting this spread include:

- **Anatomical Abnormalities**
- **Density of Local Anesthetic Solution:** Isobaric solutions like "plain" bupivacaine spread unpredictably, often resulting in a lower block height with slower onset. Hyperbaric solutions spread more predictably under gravity, typically descending along the spine's curvature when the patient is supine.

**Injection Site Considerations:**

- Injection at the second or third lumbar interspace usually results in more cranial spread, but a lower injection site may lead to inadequate block due to caudal spread.

### 5. Inactive Local Anesthetic Solution

Although amide local anesthetics like bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and lidocaine are stable and long-lasting, there have been rare cases of spinal anesthesia failure attributed to inactive local anesthetic solutions. This issue is more common with ester-type anesthetics, which degrade over time through hydrolysis.

### 6. Local Anesthetic Resistance

There have been reports of failed spinal anesthesia due to suspected local anesthetic resistance. This is thought to involve mutations in sodium channels (e.g., Nav1.1 or Nav1.7), though such mutations are rare and typically associated with significant neurological disease rather than asymptomatic individuals.

### 7. Testing the Block

Testing the adequacy of spinal anesthesia varies widely, with common practices including:

- **Motor Testing:** Asking the patient to move their legs.
- **Sensory Testing:** Assessing light touch, cold sensation, or pinprick response.

Testing should begin in the lower dermatomes and progress cephalad to avoid patient anxiety and ensure block development. Achieving adequate block height does not always equate to sufficient block quality, particularly with sensory testing. Covertly applying a painful stimulus before incision can help assess block adequacy without alarming the patient.

## Management of Failed Spinal Anaesthesia

### 1. General Approach

If a spinal block does not follow the expected onset pattern within 15 minutes of intrathecal injection, it is likely that the block will be inadequate for surgery, necessitating additional anesthetic interventions. The potential issues with the block, their likely origins, and recommended solutions are as follows:

### 2. Clinical Scenarios and Management

1. **No Block**
   - **Possible Causes:**
	 - Incorrect solution injected (e.g., syringe swap).
	 - Injection into an incorrect anatomical location (e.g., epidural space).
	 - Faulty or inactive local anesthetic.
   - **Suggested Management:**
	 - Consider repeating the spinal injection after waiting at least 20 minutes to confirm no block development.
	 - Alternatively, proceed with general anesthesia.
	 - Caution: A second injection after a delayed first block may result in a “total spinal,” leading to excessive spread of the anesthetic.

2. **Insufficient Block Height**
   - **Possible Causes:**
	 - Leakage of local anesthetic during injection.
	 - Lumbar puncture performed at too low an interspace.
	 - Anatomical barrier preventing cephalad diffusion of the anesthetic.
   - **Suggested Management:**
	 - Manipulate patient posture and utilize gravity to enhance drug spread. For hyperbaric solutions, place the patient in the Trendelenburg position with hips and knees flexed to flatten lumbar lordosis.
	 - If an isobaric solution was used, changing the patient’s position is less likely to help.
	 - Intravenous analgesia or sedation may be necessary.

3. **Unilateral Block**
   - **Possible Causes:**
	 - Incorrect patient positioning.
	 - Anatomical barrier such as longitudinal ligaments.
   - **Suggested Management:**
	 - Adjust the patient’s position so that the unblocked side is facing downward to encourage bilateral spread.
	 - Proceed with caution if the block is sufficient for ipsilateral surgery, but inform the surgical team that the contralateral limb is not anesthetized.

4. **Patchy Block**
   - **Possible Causes:**
	 - Insufficient drug dose.
	 - Inadequate distribution of the anesthetic solution.
   - **Suggested Management:**
	 - Consider repeating the spinal injection with caution, as a second injection may result in unpredictable spread.
	 - Additional intravenous analgesia or sedation may be required.
	 - If necessary, convert to general anesthesia.

5. **Inadequate Duration**
   - **Possible Causes:**
	 - Insufficient dose of local anesthetic delivered.
	 - Syringe swap resulting in a short-acting agent being injected (e.g., lidocaine instead of bupivacaine).
	 - Prolonged surgical procedure.
   - **Suggested Management:**
	 - Supplement with intravenous analgesia or sedation.
	 - Consider converting to general anesthesia if necessary.

### 3. Mechanisms of Failure and Suggested Management

| **Clinical Presentation**             | **Possible Cause**                                                      | **Suggested Management**                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No block**                          | Injection not into CSF, syringe swap, faulty local anesthetic            | Repeat injection (with caution), general anesthesia                           |
| **Insufficient block height/density** | Insufficient drug delivered, injection site too low, anatomical abnormality | Postural maneuvers, intravenous analgesia/sedation                            |
| **Unilateral block**                  | Patient positioning, anatomical abnormality                              | Postural maneuvers, proceed with care (if correct side blocked)               |
| **Patchy block**                      | Insufficient drug delivered, anatomical abnormality                      | Repeat injection (with caution), intravenous analgesia/sedation, general anesthesia |
| **Inadequate duration**               | Insufficient drug delivered, syringe swap, lengthy procedure             | Intravenous analgesia/sedation, general anesthesia                            |

### 4. Repeating the Block

If there is no appreciable block within 15–20 minutes, a repeat injection may be warranted, but only after identifying and correcting the cause of failure.

- **Risks of Repeating Injection:**
  - High concentrations of local anesthetic due to multiple injections can be neurotoxic.
  - Repeat injection may result in extensive and unpredictable cephalad spread, potentially causing cardiovascular instability, respiratory depression, or total spinal anesthesia.
  - Repeating the procedure is unlikely to be successful if the initial failure was due to anatomical barriers.
- **Special Considerations:**
  - Avoid routine repeat injections unless the previous attempt was a complete failure.
  - For unilateral blocks potentially caused by longitudinal anatomical barriers, a second injection on the opposite side may not improve outcomes and could follow the same path as the first.

In cases where anatomical factors prevent adequate spinal spread, alternative anesthesia techniques, such as epidural anesthesia, might also be less successful, and conversion to general anesthesia should be considered.
