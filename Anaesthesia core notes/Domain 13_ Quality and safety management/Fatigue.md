# Fatigue in Anesthesiology

## Definition

Fatigue is defined as:

- "inability or unwillingness to continue effective performance of a mental or physical task"
- A summary descriptor for the varied effects and labels used to describe the cognitive, behavioural, and physiological outcomes of sleep loss and circadian disruption.

## SASSA Recommendations
1. **Controlled Work Hours**  
   Implement controlled work hours in conjunction with improved handover strategies.

2. **Fatigue Alleviation Strategies**  
   - Prophylactic sleep
   - Naps
   - Improved rostering
   - Caffeine avoidance

3. **Adequate Supervision and Work Hours**  
   Schedule for adequate supervision of providers and ensure not to exceed maximum recommended working hours.

4. **Equipment Checking Discipline**  
   Maintain strict discipline in checking equipment.

5. **Personnel to Workload Ratios**  
   Ensure adequate and appropriate personnel to workload ratios.

6. **Conducive Work Environment**  
   Create a conducive work environment.

7. **Compliance with Recommended Rest Periods**  
   Exposure to after-hours work must conform to recommended rest periods.

### Detailed Recommendations on Work Hours
- **Plan work activities not to exceed 80 hours per week averaged over a six-week period.**
  - Consecutive duties should allow for a minimum rest period of 10 hours between them.
  - Continuous shifts on call should not exceed 16 hours at a time when the main activity is the provision of anaesthesia. Where the nature of activity allows for intermittent application, such as in ICU, a shift may continue for a maximum of 24 hours.
- **The work schedule must provide for non-clinical activities including:**
  - Personal development
  - Maintenance of professional competency (CME credits)
  - Contribution to enhancing the profession and competency of the fraternity
  - Compliance with requirements of continued registration (range 10–25% of available time).
- **Ensure appropriate supervision for junior providers.**
