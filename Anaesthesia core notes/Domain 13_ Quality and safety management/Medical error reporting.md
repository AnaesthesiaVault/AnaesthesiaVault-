# Definition
## Medical Error

- **Serious**: Potential life-threatening harm.
- **Minor**: Does not cause harm nor have the potential to cause harm.
- **Near Miss**: An event that could have caused harm but did not, either by chance or timely intervention.

## Preventable Adverse Event

Error resulting from error or systems failure:

- **Type 1**: Error caused by attending physician.
- **Type 2**: Error caused by anyone else in the theatre team.
- **Type 3**: Systems failure not attributable to an individual.

## Unpreventable Adverse Event

Injury or complication not due to error or systems failure, usually not preventable:

- **Type 1**: Well-known risks associated with high-risk therapies.
- **Type 2**: Rare but known risks associated with normal treatments. Patient may be unaware of the problem.

## Disclosure or Communication

Providing information about the incident.

# Labelling Drugs

Mandates the use of the generic name of the drug

English

Recommends colour coding

# Drug Safety
## Specific Recommendations Related to the Avoidance of Drug Error in Drug Administration in Order of Strength (After Jensen and Colleagues)

|Action|Strength of Evidence|
|---|---|
|1. The label on any drug or ampoule or syringe should be carefully read before a drug is drawn up or injected|Strongly recommended|
|2. Legibility and contents of labels on ampoules and syringes should be optimized according to agreed standards|Strongly recommended|
|3. Syringes should be labelled (always or almost always)|Strongly recommended|
|4. Formal organization of drug drawers and workspace should be used|Strongly recommended|
|5. Labels should be checked specifically with a second person or device before a drug is drawn up or administered|Recommended|
|6. Errors in i.v. drug administration during anaesthesia should be reported and reviewed|Recommended|
|7. Management of the drug inventory should focus on minimizing the risk of drug error|Recommended|
|8. Similar packaging and presentation of drugs should be avoided where possible|Recommended|
|9. Drugs should be presented in prefilled syringes rather than ampoules|Possibly recommended|
|10. Drugs should be drawn up and labelled by the anaesthetist who will administer them|Possibly recommended|
|11. Colour coding by class of drug according to an agreed national or international standard should be used|Possibly recommended|
|12. Coding by syringe position or by the needle on the syringe should be used|Unclear|

## APSF Consensus Recommendations 2010

**APSF Consensus Recommendations for Improving Medication Safety in the Operating Room**

#### Standardization

1. High-alert drugs (such as phenylephrine and epinephrine) should be available in standardized concentrations/diluents prepared by pharmacy in a ready-to-use form that is appropriate for both adult and pediatric patients. Infusions should be delivered by an electronically controlled smart device containing a drug library.
2. Ready-to-use syringes and infusions should have standardized fully compliant machine-readable labels.

#### Technology

1. Every anesthetizing location should have a mechanism to identify medications before drawing up or administering them (barcode reader) and a mechanism to provide feedback, decision support, and documentation (automated information system).

#### Additional Ideas

1. Routine provider-prepared medications should be discontinued whenever possible.
2. Clinical pharmacists should be part of the perioperative/operating room team.
3. Standardized pre-prepared medication kits by case type should be used whenever possible.

#### Culture

1. Establish a "just culture" for reporting errors (including near misses) and discussion of lessons learned.
2. Establish a culture of education, understanding, and accountability via a required curriculum and CME.
3. Establish a culture of cooperation and recognition of the benefits of STPC within and between institutions, professional organizations, and accreditation agencies.
# Protocol for Intra-arterial Injection
## Iatrogenic

1. **Maintain intra-arterial catheter**
	- Initiate infusion of 0.9% saline solution via arterial catheter to maintain patency.
2. **Confirm diagnosis**
3. **If no contraindications, initiate anticoagulation via venous catheter**

## Non-Iatrogenic

1. **Obtain baseline angiogram**
2. **Assess for signs and symptoms of infection (culture if necessary)**
3. **Initiate antibiotic therapy as needed**
4. **If no contraindications, initiate anticoagulation via venous catheter**

## Provide Symptomatic Relief

- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids for pain control.
- Elevation of extremity to reduce lymphedema.
- Massage therapy.
- Axillary nerve blockade as indicated.

## Manage Arterial Spasm

- Calcium channel blockers.
- Heparinization vs. extremity sympatholysis (see text for details).
- Antispasmodics (e.g., papaverine).
- Injection of local anesthetics.
- Thromboxane inhibitors.
- Iloprost (vasodilator and platelet aggregation inhibitor).

## Reestablish Blood Flow

- Thrombolytics.
- Surgical thrombectomy.

## Treat Sequelae

- Necrotic tissue debridement.
- Antibiotic therapy as indicated.
### Set up Long-term Rehabilitation

- Physical/occupational therapy.
- Chronic pain management.
# Types of Drugs Errors

|Type|Characteristics|Example|
|---|---|---|
|A|Augmented|Dose dependent predicted from the known pharmacology of the drug.|
|B|Bizarre|Unpredictable, dose independent, rare, fatal.|
|C|Chronic|Prolonged treatment.|
|D|Delayed|After years of treatment.|
|E|End of use|Withdrawal effect.|

# Extravasation Injury Management

## Management
- **Stop Injection/Infusion**
	
	- Immediately stop the injection or disconnect the infusion.
- **Aspirate Drug**
	
	- Aspirate as much of the drug as possible from the cannula.
- **Cannula Management**
	
	- Leave the cannula in place until further treatment advice is sought.
	- Remove the cannula immediately when no longer required to prevent further use and injury.
- **Mark the Area**
	
	- If visible, mark the area of extravasation with a pen or take photographs.
- **Elevate the Limb**
	
	- Elevate the affected limb to reduce swelling.
- **Specific Treatments**
	
	- Consider specific treatments if appropriate, depending on the drug extravasated.
- **Referral**
	
	- Consider referral to plastic surgery for further management if necessary.
- **Documentation**
	
	- Ensure thorough documentation of the incident and management steps taken.
