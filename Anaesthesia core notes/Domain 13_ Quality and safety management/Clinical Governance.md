# Clinical Governance

Clinical governance is defined as a system through which health services are responsible and accountable for:

- Continuously improving services
- Safeguarding high standards of care
- Ensuring the best clinical outcomes for patient care

The system of governance includes the following aspects of clinical risk management:

- Mortality and morbidity reviews
- Adverse events and near misses reporting* and reviews
- Patient record reviews and peer reviews
- Clinical audits, measuring compliance with best practice

*A near-miss defines a hazard or unsafe situation that has the potential to cause harm, but does not. An adverse event describes actual harm that occurs to the patient.*
