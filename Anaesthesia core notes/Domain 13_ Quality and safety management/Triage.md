### SATS Priority Levels

#### Immediate (Red)
**Target Time:** Immediate
**Management:** Take to the resuscitation room for emergency management.

#### Very Urgent (Orange)
**Target Time:** < 10 minutes
**Management:** Refer to majors for very urgent management.

#### Urgent (Yellow)
**Target Time:** < 1 hour
**Management:** Refer to majors for urgent management.

#### Non-Urgent (Green)
**Target Time:** < 4 hours
**Management:** Refer to designated area for non-urgent cases.

#### Certification Required (Blue)
**Target Time:** < 2 hours
**Management:** Refer to doctor for certification.

# Triage
## Concept of Triage

- **Definition:** Derived from French "trier" meaning "to sort" or "to sieve".
- **Purpose:** Guides prioritization in treatment and evacuation, ensuring the right patient receives the right care at the right time.
- **Applications:** Used in pre-hospital mass casualty situations and hospital emergency departments.
- **Process:** Dynamic, must be repeated as patient conditions change.
- **Structure:** Commonly involves priority levels with specific actions, often color-coded for clarity in stressful environments.
## The NCEPOD Classification (2004)

- **IMMEDIATE:**
	
	- **Parameters:** Immediate life, limb, or organ-saving intervention; resuscitation simultaneous with intervention.
	- **Examples:** Life-saving (e.g., ruptured aortic aneurysm); Other (e.g., limb or organ saving).
- **URGENT:**
	
	- **Parameters:** Acute onset or clinical deterioration of potentially life-threatening conditions.
	- **Examples:** Conditions threatening survival of limb/organ, fixation of fractures, relief of pain/distressing symptoms.
	- **Timing:** Normally within hours of the decision to operate.
- **EXPECTED:**
	
	- **Parameters:** Early treatment required where the condition is not an immediate threat to life, limb, or organ survival.
	- **Timing:** Normally within days of the decision to operate.
- **ELECTIVE:**
	
	- **Parameters:** Planned or booked in advance of routine admission.
	- **Timing:** To suit patient, hospital, and staff.

## The Acute Surgery Priority System (NSW Health Surgical Services Task Force, Australia)

- **< 15 minutes:** Immediate life-threatening.
	
	- **Condition:** Patient is in immediate risk of loss of life, shocked, or moribund.
- **< 1 hour:** Life-threatening.
	
	- **Condition:** Life-threatening condition but responding to resuscitative measures.
- **< 4 hours:** Organ/limb threatening.
	
	- **Condition:** Physiologically stable but at immediate risk of organ survival or systemic decompensation.
- **< 8 hours:** Non-critical, emergent.
	
	- **Condition:** Physiologically stable; significant deterioration if untreated.
- **< 24 hours:** Non-critical, non-emergent, urgent.
	
	- **Condition:** Stable; no deterioration expected.
- **< 72 hours:** Semi-urgent, not stable for discharge.
	
	- **Condition:** Stable; not suitable for discharge.

## Groote Schuur Emergency Surgery Triage System (GSEST)

- **Development:** Introduced by Groote Schuur Hospital's Department of Anaesthesia in 2010.
- **Integration:** Uses color codes identical to the South African Triage Scale (SATS).
- **Implementation:** Manual booking replaced with a computerized system linked to an electronic display.
- **Innovation:** Introduced an Anaesthetic Triage Registrar (ATR) role, usually a senior trainee assessing emergency surgical cases for anaesthetic risk and optimization strategies, ensuring seamless communication between surgical and anaesthetic teams.

### Target Times

1. **Red (Immediate)**
	
	- **Parameters:** Life is in immediate danger; requires immediate treatment.
	- **Examples:** Airway obstruction, severe breathing problems.
2. **Orange (Expedited)**
	
	- **Parameters:** Requires urgent surgery within 1 to 2 hours.
	- **Examples:** Ruptured ectopic pregnancy, leaking aortic aneurysm, cranial decompression.
3. **Yellow (Urgent)**
	
	- **Parameters:** Requires surgery within 6 hours of booking.
	- **Examples:** Compound fractures, appendicitis, incarcerated hernia/intestinal obstruction.
4. **Green (Emergent)**
	
	- **Parameters:** Not immediately life-threatening but requires surgery within 24 hours.
	- **Examples:** ORIF of simple fractures, bleeding hemorrhoids, I&D abscess.
5. **Blue (Scheduled)**
	
	- **Parameters:** Semi-urgent cases to be done within 72 hours.
	- **Examples:** Non-life-threatening conditions needing surgical intervention.
6. **Blue (Expectant)**
	
	- **Parameters:** Either deceased or so severely injured that survival is unlikely with available resources.

## Conclusion

- **Utility:** Urgency categorization tools prioritize cases based on surgical acuity, not just booking order.
- **Impact:** Effective in using resources wisely and reducing morbidity and mortality due to delays.
- **Communication:** Enhances interaction and decision-making between health professionals, improving patient outcomes.
