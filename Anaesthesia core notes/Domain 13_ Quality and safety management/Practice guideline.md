# SASSA Guidelines on Practice

## Restrictions on Anaesthesia Provision by Experience Level

1. **General Practitioner (GP):**  
   Should not be involved in independent anaesthesia administration without additional training beyond internship and community service.

2. **Diploma in Anaesthesia (DA) ≤ 3 years or 'experienced' GP without DA:**  
   - ASA I and II: Independent administration allowed
   - ASA III: Supervised and not for major surgeries
   - Paediatric Anaesthesia: Allowed for minor elective surgeries if experience is ≥ 2 years

3. **DA ≥ 3 years:**  
   Can administer anaesthesia to ASA III patients but will be held to specialist standards in court.

4. **Registrars:**  
   - Ideally, supervision should be 2:1
   - Up to 4:1 supervision if the risk is low
   - 1:1 supervision if the risk is high

5. **Specialists:**  
   Should restrict practice to areas where they have maintained necessary advanced skills.

*Note: ≥ 75% anaesthesia work for ≥ 3 years is considered 'experienced.'

## Practice Guidelines for Use of Ultrasound

1. **General Application:**  
   Considered an essential precaution due to numerous adverse events and alignment with international best practice when ultrasound was not used.

2. **Vascular Access:**
   - Superior to landmark technique for IVC cannulation (high-quality evidence)
   - May be used for cannulation of subclavian or femoral vessels
   - Equivocal evidence for arterial cannulation

3. **Nerve Blocks:**  
   Should be ultrasound-guided where possible and if the practitioner is adequately trained.

4. **Focused Assessment with Transthoracic Echocardiography (FATE):**  
   Accepted as a standard basic skill but should not replace a full echocardiogram if indicated.

## SASSA Sedation Guidelines

- **Patient Selection and Evaluation:**  
  Emphasize a focused airway examination.
- **Patient Eligibility:**  
  Only ASA I and II patients qualify for sedation outside the operating theatre.
- **Knowledge of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics:**  
  Understanding of drug properties and interactions.
- **Drug Administration:**  
  Use the minimal dose necessary to ensure patient safety and comfort. Allow full effect of the initial dose before administering any additional doses. Fixed doses or boluses are not recommended.
- **Trained Sedation Practitioner:**  
  Ensure support staff and facilities meet safety requirements.
- **Emergency Management:**  
  Practitioners must be able to manage, rescue, and recover patients who enter deeper sedation levels than intended.

## Safe Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA) Use Guidelines

1. **Training and Competence:**  
   Ensure all anaesthetists are trained and competent in TIVA delivery.

2. **Target-Controlled Infusion (TCI):**  
   Recommended when general anaesthesia is maintained by Propofol infusion.

3. **Patient-Specific Target Concentrations:**  
   Based on co-administered drugs and clinical situation.

4. **Standardized Concentrations:**  
   Maintain standardized concentrations of Propofol ampoules and Remifentanil dilution within an anaesthetic department.

5. **Infusion Set Requirements:**  
   Use Luer lock, anti-reflux valves, minimize dead space, and specific sets if possible.

6. **Syringe and Pump Programming:**  
   Insert the syringe first, then program the pump.

7. **Visibility of IV Cannula/Central Venous Catheter (CVC):**  
   Ensure visibility throughout anaesthesia.

8. **Processed Electroencephalogram (pEEG) Familiarity:**  
   Understand the principles, interpretation, and limitations of pEEG.

9. **pEEG Use with Neuromuscular Blockade (NMB):**  
   Use pEEG when NMB is administered with TIVA.

10. **Standards of Practice and Monitoring:**  
	Maintain the same standards of practice and monitoring outside the operating theatre when using TIVA, as applied in-theatre.
# Clinical Practice Recommendations at Different Hospital Levels in South Africa

The following tables are adapted from the International Standards for the Practice of Safe Anaesthesia. Facilities in South Africa where anaesthesia is delivered should comply with Hospital Level 2 and 3 standards. Note that "highly recommended" is seen as essential for the purposes of the SASA Practice Guidelines. Items in Table 1 are therefore essential, and items in Table 2 (including continuous temperature monitoring and neuromuscular transmission (NMT) monitoring) are strongly recommended for perioperative monitoring in South African district hospitals.

## Level 1 (Rural Hospital or Health Center with a Small Number of Beds)

**Peri-Anesthetic Care and Monitoring Standards (HIGHLY Recommended):**

- Continuous direct presence in the anaesthetising location of a vigilant anesthesia professional.
- Appropriate “pre-check” of the anesthesia system, facilities, equipment, and supplies.
- Use of the relevant components of the WHO Safe Surgery Checklist.
- Supplemental oxygen administered to all patients undergoing general anesthesia.
- Continuous use of pulse oximetry.
- Continuous monitoring of airway and ventilation by observing the bag and with a stethoscope.
- Confirmation of the correct placement of an endotracheal tube by auscultation.
- Continuous monitoring of the pulse by clinical examination and with a pulse oximeter.
- Availability of a defibrillator.
- Continuous monitoring of tissue perfusion by clinical examination and with a pulse oximeter.
- Monitoring of non-invasive arterial blood pressure at appropriate intervals.
- Use of a disconnect alarm if mechanical ventilation is employed.
- Audible signals (e.g., pulse oximeter) and alarms activated at all times.
- All patients should remain where anaesthetised until recovered or be transported safely to a specifically designated recovery location.
- Immediate availability of oxygen, suction, and a means of ventilation in Recovery.
- Continuous use of pulse oximetry until recovery of consciousness.
- Adequate pain relief, including narcotics when needed.

## Level 2 (District or Provincial Hospital, e.g., 100-300 beds)

**Peri-Anesthetic Care and Monitoring Standards (HIGHLY Recommended):**

- All standards from Level 1, plus:
1. Monitoring of inspired oxygen concentration with an instrument fitted with a low oxygen concentration alarm.
2. Use of a device protecting against the delivery of a hypoxic gas mixture.
3. Use of capnography to verify the correct placement of the endotracheal tube or other airway device and the adequacy of ventilation.
4. Use of a continuous electrocardiograph.
5. Continuous measurement of temperature.
6. Use of a peripheral neuromuscular transmission monitor when neuromuscular blocking drugs are given.
7. Sufficient trained staff in the post-anesthesia recovery area to manage patients recovering from anesthesia and surgery.

## Level 3 (Referral Hospital, 300-1,000 or More Beds with Basic Intensive Care Facilities)

**Peri-Anesthetic Care and Monitoring Standards (HIGHLY Recommended):**

- All standards from Levels 1 and 2, plus:
- Continuous measurement of the inspiratory and/or expired gas volumes and of the concentration of volatile agents.
- Continuous measurement and display of arterial pressure in appropriate cases.
- Use of continuous electronic temperature measurement.
- Monitoring of urine output during prolonged procedures or when significant administration of intravenous fluids is anticipated.

# Impaired Clinician

1. **Report:** Your concern to the relevant supervisor.
2. **Schedule:** A formal meeting; be prepared for anger and denial.
3. **Offer the Opportunity:** To prove they do not have a problem by testing.
4. **Family Involvement:** Engage the clinician's family.
5. **Rehabilitation Program:** HPCSA regulations will determine if the clinician must not work and for how long.
6. **Step-wise Reintegration:**
   - Return to anaesthesia immediately vs. delayed vs. change specialty (Angres criteria)
   - Treat as a chronic disease with continuous surveillance.
