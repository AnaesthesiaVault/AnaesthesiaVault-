# 5 Steps of risk Management
- **Risk Awareness**: Hospital care constitutes a complex system that inherently brings risk.
- **Risk Identification**: A process for identifying specific risks in a particular set of circumstances, either retrospectively or prospectively.
- **Risk Assessment**: An assessment of the magnitude of a particular risk, its likelihood of resulting in a particular outcome, and the impact of that outcome on the patient(s).
- **Risk Management**: The development of plans and strategies to minimize identified risks to tolerable levels.
- **Re-evaluation**: A continuous process of reviewing risks to develop safer systems.
## Components Pf risk Management
#### Assess Risk: Potential and Actual

- Handling and moving assessment
- Pressure ulcer risk assessment
- Wound assessment
- Skill-mix and staffing levels
- Workload analysis
- Patient factors (e.g., confused or wandering patients)
- Clinical supervision
- Analysis of adverse incidents and complaints
- Risk registers

#### Manage Risk

- Risk control, avoidance, or acceptance
- Education and training
- Managing poor performers
- Compliance with mandatory training
- Development of protocols to guide practice
- One-to-one care for confused or at-risk patients
- The use of specialist equipment (e.g., mattresses)
- Early warning systems

#### Risk Evaluation

- Clinical audits
- Benchmarking practices
- Health and safety inspections
- Audit of compliance with mandatory training
- Analysis of adverse incidents and complaints
# NAP-6 Summary

## NAP-6: Perioperative Anaphylaxis in the UK

1. **Incidence**: 1 in 10,000 anaesthetics.
2. **Common Triggers**:
	- Antibiotics (47%)
	- Muscle relaxants (33%)
	- Chlorhexidine (9%)
	- Patent blue dye (5%)
3. **Outcomes**: >96% of patients with life-threatening anaphylaxis survived the event.
4. **Low Blood Pressure**: Most common presenting feature.
5. **Cardiac Arrest**: Occurred in 15% of cases with prompt treatment but delayed CPR when blood pressure was very low.
6. **Elderly Patients**: Higher risk of cardiac arrest and death.
7. **Teicoplanin**: 17-fold more likely to cause anaphylaxis than alternatives.
8. **ICU Admissions**: Three-quarters of patients required ICU admission but most recovered quickly.
9. **Investigation Time**: Average time for investigation to take place in an allergy clinic was >100 days.
10. **Communication**: Improvement needed in communication to patients by anaesthetists and allergy doctors.
11. **Patient Harm**: One-third experienced harm, with anxiety about future anaesthesia being common.
# Risk Scores and Outcomes Measured

## Revised Cardiac Index Score
**Risk Outcomes**:
- Death
- Myocardial infarction (MI)
- Cardiac arrest

*Measured at 30 days post non-cardiac surgery*

## NSQIP (National Surgical Quality Improvement Program)
**Risk Outcomes**:
- Myocardial infarction (MI)
- Cardiac arrest

*Note: NSQIP also measures multiple other outcomes beyond cardiac events.*

## P-POSSUM (Portsmouth Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity)
**Risk Outcomes**:
- Mortality

### Morbidity Defined As
- Hemorrhage
- Infection (including pneumonia, wound infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), deep infection, septicemia, and fever of unknown origin)
- Wound dehiscence or anastomotic leak
- Thrombosis (including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or myocardial infarction (MI))
- Cardiac failure
- Impaired renal function (urea increase >5 mmol/L from pre-operative levels)
- Hypotension
- Respiratory failure
- Any other complication

*Note: The first two outcomes (death and myocardial infarction) are specific to cardiac risk.*

### Summary

These risk scores are crucial for evaluating the likelihood of adverse outcomes following surgery. The Revised Cardiac Index Score focuses specifically on cardiac outcomes within 30 days post-surgery, NSQIP includes a broader range of outcomes with a particular emphasis on MI and cardiac arrest, and P-POSSUM provides a comprehensive evaluation of both mortality and a detailed spectrum of morbidity.

|High Risk|>1/100|Risk of diarrhea after antibiotics|

# Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

**Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** is a structured investigation aimed at identifying the true cause of a problem and the actions necessary to eliminate it. RCA is more time and labor-intensive than routine departmental procedures, offering a thorough and formal analysis of why an adverse event occurred and how it may be prevented in the future, rather than a quick fix focused on the most obvious symptom of a problem. There are four stages of RCA as follows:

### I. Data Collection

All available information that may help the investigation is collected, ranging from local protocols to switchboard records. The patient's entire admission is considered, not just the Patient Safety Incident (PSI).

### Ii. Presentation of Information

The method of presenting information depends on the case. Examples include:

- A simple chronological narrative.
- A tabular timeline.
- A table listing what each person involved in the incident was doing for each 5-minute block of time.

### Iii. Root Cause Identification

There are various methods for identifying the underlying system errors that cause PSIs. Examples include:

#### 1. **5 Whys**

This process involves not accepting the first answer for a root cause and continually asking why each cause happened until all agree that the fundamental cause has been identified. This process often requires more than five iterations.

#### 2. **Barrier Analysis**

This examines the control measures in place to prevent error. Types of barriers include:

- **Physical Barriers**: These are the strongest but not always feasible, such as locking a patient-controlled analgesia device.
- **Natural Barriers**: Temporal barriers, like waiting between two independent brain stem death tests, or spatial barriers, like locking potassium solutions for intravenous injection away with controlled drugs.
- **Human Barriers**: Examples include checking blood before transfusion.
- **Administrative Barriers**: These include protocols, supervision, and training. However, human and administrative barriers are weak as they are particularly prone to error.

There are numerous other techniques, and each technique may be used for each problem identified, not just for the PSI as a whole.

### Iv. Recommendations and Implementation

This stage involves making recommendations based on the findings of the RCA and implementing these recommendations to prevent future occurrences of similar adverse events.

### Summary

Root Cause Analysis is a detailed process used to identify the fundamental causes of problems and develop strategies to eliminate them, ensuring a thorough approach to improving patient safety and preventing future incidents.
