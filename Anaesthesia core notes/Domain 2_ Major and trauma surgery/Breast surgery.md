# Management of Tamoxifen Perioperatively

## Breast Cancer Patient on Tamoxifen

### Age Group < 60 Years

#### Risk Factors (2 or more)

- Family history of DVT
- BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²
- Significant co-morbidities, i.e., cardiac, respiratory or metabolic

##### High Risk for DVT

- **Yes:** Consider stopping Tamoxifen 3 weeks before and after surgery
	- TEDS
	- LMWH until fully mobile
- **No:** Assess for recent chemotherapy

#### Recent Chemotherapy

- **Yes:** Stop Tamoxifen 3 weeks prior and restart the pre-op dose immediately after surgery
- **No:** Assess duration of surgery
	- **> 90 min:** Stop Tamoxifen 3 weeks prior and restart the pre-op dose immediately after surgery
	- **< 90 min:** Continue Tamoxifen at the pre-op dose

### Age Group > 60 Years

#### Risk Factors (1 or more)

- Family history of DVT
- BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²
- Significant co-morbidities, i.e., cardiac, respiratory or metabolic

##### High Risk for DVT

- **Yes:** Follow High Risk Protocol
- **No:** No special management needed
# Anaesthesia for Breast Surgery
## Breast Surgery Types

- **Radical Mastectomy**: Rarely performed today; replaced by Breast-Conserving Treatment (BCT).
- **Breast-Conserving Treatment (BCT)**: Wide local excision with radiotherapy/chemotherapy, requires a 5 mm margin of normal tissue.
- **Mastectomy**: Necessary for multifocal disease, inflammatory breast cancer, prior radiation, or personal choice. Includes simple, skin-sparing, and nipple-sparing mastectomies.
- **Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB)**: Replaces axillary lymph node dissection, uses radioisotopes and dyes, minimizes adverse effects like lymphedema.
- **Breast Reconstruction**: Can be immediate or delayed, using prosthetic or autologous material. Techniques include TRAM and DIEP flaps, requiring meticulous intraoperative management.

## Preoperative Assessment

- **Anxiety Management**: Preoperative contact with anaesthetist is crucial.
- **Comorbidity Optimization**: Assess impact of neoadjuvant therapies (cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, VTE risk).
- **Medication Management**: Continue most medications, with exceptions for anticoagulants and certain hypertensives.

## Intraoperative Management

- **Induction and Maintenance of Anaesthesia**: IV or inhalation induction, TIVA or inhalation agents.
- **Cannulation and Monitoring**: Prefer contralateral arm for IV access, use large-bore secure IV access for long procedures.
- **Haemodynamic Monitoring**: Consider invasive monitoring for complex procedures or those with cardiac comorbidities.
- **Airway Management**: Supraglottic airway for shorter procedures, tracheal intubation for longer/more complex ones.
- **Temperature and Positioning**: Use forced-air warmers, maintain normothermia, careful positioning to prevent nerve injury.
- **Flap Surgery Considerations**: Avoid hypothermia, hypovolaemia, and excessive fluid administration to ensure flap perfusion.

## Postoperative Management

- **High Dependency Unit (HDU) Monitoring**: Required for free-flap procedures for at least 24 hours.
- **Analgesia**: Regular simple analgesics (paracetamol, NSAIDs), regional anaesthesia to minimize opioids.
- **Early Mobilization**: Encourage to reduce postoperative complications.
- **Day-Case Surgery**: Suitable for minor procedures like wide local excision with SLNB.

## Regional Anaesthesia Techniques

- **Thoracic Paravertebral Block (TPVB)**: Local anaesthetic in paravertebral space, reduces acute and possibly chronic postsurgical pain.
- **Thoracic Epidural Anaesthesia (TEA)**: Less common due to high failure rate, suitable for prolonged reconstructive surgery.
- **Pectoral Nerve Blocks (PECS I and II)**: Blocks medial/lateral pectoral nerves, intercostal nerves; fast-acting, less opioid use.
- **Serratus Anterior Plane (SAP) Block**: Blocks lateral cutaneous branches of thoracic intercostal nerves, effective for anterolateral chest wall analgesia.
- **Transversus Thoracic Plane Block**: Provides medial analgesia, supplements PECS blocks.
- **Local Anaesthetic Infusion**: Catheter in the surgical wound, effective when combined with PECS blocks.

## Anaesthesia and Breast Cancer Recurrence

- Ongoing research investigates the impact of anaesthetic techniques on cancer recurrence. Trials like NCT00418457 are examining the effects of different anaesthetic regimens on disease-free survival.
