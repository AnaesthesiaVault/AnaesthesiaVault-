# Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome (BCIS)

## Definition and Classification
- **Definition**: Currently, there is no agreed-upon definition. However, BCIS is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical features that range from transient desaturation and hypotension to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest at the time of cement deployment.
  - **Clinical Features**: BCIS is characterized by hypoxia, hypotension, or both, and/or unexpected loss of consciousness occurring around the time of cementation, prosthesis insertion, reduction of the joint, or occasionally, limb tourniquet deflation in a patient undergoing cemented bone surgery.
  - **Underlying Cause**: Right ventricular failure secondary to increased pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is considered the underlying cause of systemic hypotension and sudden cardiac arrest.

## Grading of Presentation
- **Grade 1**: Moderate hypoxia (SpO2 < 94%) or a decrease in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) > 20%.
- **Grade 2**: Severe hypoxia (SpO2 < 88%) or hypotension (decrease in SAP > 40%) or unexpected loss of consciousness.
- **Grade 3**: Cardiovascular collapse requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

## Timing of Presentation

Typically occurs at the time of:

- Cementation prosthesis insertion
- Reduction in the joint
- Deflation of a limb tourniquet

## Pathophysiology

The thin-walled and compliant right ventricle rapidly dilates and shifts the interventricular septum to the left, thereby reducing the volume of the left ventricular cavity. This occurs because the total volume of the heart cannot expand rapidly due to constraints by the pericardium, causing:

- Decreased left ventricular (LV) compliance
- Decreased LV filling
- Reduced cardiac output (CO)

### Embolus Composition
- Fat
- Platelets
- Fibrin
- Marrow Debris

### Mechanisms of Vasoconstriction
1. **Reflex Vasoconstriction and Endothelial Production**
   - Production of endothelin 1.
2. **Release of Vasoconstriction Mediators**
   - Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
   - Serotonin (5-HT)
   - Thromboxane A2 (Tx-A2)
   - Platelet-activating factor (PAF)
   - Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
3. **Vasoconstriction Attributable to Non-Cellular Components of Embolus**
   - Thrombin

### Theories for Bone Implantation Syndrome

#### 1. Monomer Theory
- Circulating methyl methacrylate (MMA) molecules cause vasodilation in vitro.

#### 2. Embolic Theory

##### Mechanical Effects
- **Debris Embolization**: Debris, including marrow, fat, cement particles, air, bone particles, and aggregates of platelets and fibrin, embolize to the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery.
- **Cause**: High intramedullary pressure.
  - *Explanation*: Shower of microemboli of blood, fat, or platelets forced into the circulation by high intramedullary pressure during cement packing and prosthesis insertion. Subsequent embolization to the lungs produces a raised pulmonary vascular resistance and reduction in left ventricular return, resulting in hypotension.

##### Mediator Effects
- **Vasoactive or Pro-inflammatory Substances**: Released as a result of systemic embolization of the bone cement. These can directly increase pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by raising the blood levels of thrombin and tissue thromboplastin.
- **Mechanical Stimulation or Endothelial Damage**: Caused by the cement emboli, which induce reflex vasoconstriction through the release of endothelial mediators.
- **Histamine Release and Hypersensitivity**: Triggered by the emboli.
- **Complement Activation**: Induced by the emboli.

## Risk Factors for the Development of Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome (BCIS)

### Patient Factors
- ASA III-IV
- Pre-existing pulmonary hypertension
- Significant cardiac disease
- Osteoporosis
- Pathological fracture
- Intertrochanteric fracture
- Long-stem arthroplasty
- Old age
- Poor pre-existing physical reserve
- Impaired cardiopulmonary function
- Bony metastases
- Concomitant hip fractures, particularly pathological or intertrochanteric fractures

### Risk Reduction
#### Anaesthetic Risk Reduction
- Avoidance of further cemented procedures in patients with a history of severe BCIS.
- Volatile anaesthetic agents may be associated with greater haemodynamic changes for the same embolic load.
- Consider avoiding nitrous oxide in high-risk patients to avoid exacerbating air embolism.
- Increase inspired oxygen concentration for all patients at the time of cementation.
- Avoid intravascular volume depletion to reduce haemodynamic changes in BCIS.
- Consider high-level haemodynamic monitoring in high-risk patients.

## Composition of Bone Cement

### Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) - 90%
- **Powder Polymer**: Pre-polymerized PMMA
- **Initiator**: Dibenzoylperoxide
- **Liquid Monomer**: MMA
- **Activator**: N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine

### Antibiotics
- Gentamicin
- Tobramycin
- Clindamycin

### Radiographic Contrast Material - 10%
- Zirconium dioxide or barium sulphate

#### Potential Disadvantages of Antibiotic-Loaded Bone Cement
- Alteration in the mechanical and structural properties of the bone cement
- Antibiotic resistance
- Allergic reactions
- Systemic toxicity
- Cost implications

##### General Information
- Low-dose antibiotic-loaded bone cement is defined as 1g of powdered antibiotic per 40g of bone cement.
- Antibiotic-loaded bone cements have also been implicated as a rare cause of postoperative renal failure in at-risk patients.

## Management
1. **Communication between the Surgeon and the Anaesthetist**
   - Critical during periods such as cementation prosthesis insertion, reduction in the joint, and deflation of a limb tourniquet.
   - Initial clinical signs: A fall in end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration may be the first indication of clinically significant BCIS in the anaesthetized patient and should alert the anaesthetist.
   - Oesophageal Doppler measurements may detect impending BCIS earlier than standard haemodynamic monitoring.
   - Early signs of BCIS in the awake patient: Dyspnoea and altered sensorium.
   
2. **If BCIS is Suspected**
   - Increase FiO2 to 100% and continue supplementary oxygen into the postoperative period.
   - Manage as right ventricular failure [Pulmonary Hypertension](Pulmonary%20Hypertension.md).
   - Aggressive resuscitation with intravenous fluids is recommended.
   - Use central venous pressure (CVP) for inotropes.
	 - Sympathetic Î±1 agonists should be the first-line agent in the context of right heart dysfunction and vasodilatation.
	 - Commence fluid resuscitation if there is insufficient pre-load.
