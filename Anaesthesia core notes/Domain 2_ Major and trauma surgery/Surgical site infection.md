# Surgical Site Infection

## Introduction
- Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the second most common cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), following urinary tract infections (UTIs).
- **Consequences:**
  - Prolonged hospital stay, significantly increased healthcare costs, and a higher mortality rate in certain types of surgery.
  - Five-fold increase in hospital readmissions, 60% more likely to be admitted to ICU, and twice as likely to die.

## Definition
- SSIs are infections occurring within 30 days after surgery with no implant, or within 1 year if an implant is placed and the infection appears related to the surgery.
- Classified as either incisional (superficial vs deep) or organ/space infections.

## Risk Factors

### Risk Factors for Development of Postoperative Surgical Infection

#### Patient Factors
- Diabetes mellitus
- Obesity
- Smoking
- Bacterial colonization
- Remote infection
- Older age
- Underlying illness
- Malnutrition
- Hypoxaemia
- Surgical technique
- Site and type of surgery
- Length of procedure

#### Perioperative Variables
- Operating theatre characteristics
- Use of foreign materials
- Antibiotic prophylaxis*
- Hand hygiene*
- Invasive anaesthetic procedures*
- Hypothermia*
- Face masks and theatre traffic*
- Regional anaesthesia*
- Tissue oxygenation*
- Perioperative glycaemic control*
- Volume status and fluid replacement*
- Transfusion of allogeneic blood products*
- Postoperative pain control

*Factors modifiable by the anaesthetist

## Principles of Surveillance

### Methods of Surveillance
- Chart review
- Medication review
- Laboratory-based ward surveillance
- Laboratory-based telephone surveillance
- Ward liaison surveillance
- Treatment and temperature chart surveillance
- Risk factor surveillance
- Antimicrobial use monitoring
- Microbiology reports

### Principles of an Effective Surveillance System
- Maintain accurate, efficient, confidential data collection
- Provide data on final infection rates stratified by multivariate risk for each surgeon and patient
- Use clear, consistent definitions of infection
- Use standardized post-discharge follow-up protocols and proper maintenance of data

## Surgical Wound Classification

- **Clean surgery:**
  - No break in aseptic technique, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tracts not breached.
- **Clean-contaminated surgery:**
  - Involves the oropharynx, sterile genitourinary or biliary tract, gastrointestinal, or respiratory tracts, or minor breach in aseptic technique.
- **Contaminated surgery:**
  - Presence of acute inflammation, infected bilious secretions, infected urine, or gross contamination from the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Dirty surgery:**
  - Established infection exists, and therapeutic antibiotics are administered based on susceptibility of bacterial isolates grown from culture.

## Prevention

### Pre-Operative
- Full body wash
- Prepare surgical site immediately before incision
- Decontaminate hands
- Remove hair on table (with electric clippers if available)

### Peri-Operative
- Maintain saturation >95%
  - Monitor and correct blood glucose
  - Maintain normothermia

### Antibiotics
- Use prophylactically for clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty surgery
- Select according to guidelines based on operation and local resistance patterns
- Administer IV within 60 minutes before incision
- Repeat dose if operation longer than half-life of antibiotic
- Do not routinely continue beyond 24 hours

## Modifiable Factors by Anaesthetist to Prevent SSI
- Hand hygiene
- Minimize theatre traffic
- Antibiotic prophylaxis
- Perform invasive procedures aseptically
- Prevent hypothermia
- Use regional anaesthesia where possible
- Ensure tissue oxygenation
- Control blood glucose
- Limit blood transfusions
- Post-operative pain control

## Surgical Prophylaxis

### Agent Choice
- The agent must have activity against pathogens most likely to contaminate the wound, given in doses sufficient to achieve adequate tissue levels for the entire period of potential contamination, and continued for the shortest effective duration.
- Antibiotics with a narrow spectrum are preferred to minimize the risk of antibiotic resistance.
- Cefazolin is commonly used for prophylaxis in most surgical procedures:
  - Relatively narrow spectrum, active against staphylococci, some Gram-negatives, and many other bacteria likely to contaminate the operative site.
  - Its duration of action is sufficient for most procedures, and it is reasonably safe and cost-effective.

### Microflora of Different Anatomical Sites
- **Skin:** Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci
- **Cardiac:** Gram-positives including S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci
- **Thoracic:** Predominantly Gram-positives
- **Gastroduodenal:** Coliforms (Escherichia coli, Proteus species, Klebsiella species), and Gram-positives (staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci)
- **Biliary Tract:** Gram-negatives and Gram-positives (E. coli, Klebsiella species, enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci)
- **Small Intestine:** Predominantly Gram-negatives
- **Colorectal:** Anaerobes (Bacteroides fragilis) and Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli)
- **Head and Neck:** S. aureus, streptococci (aerobic and anaerobic), and other anaerobes
- **Neurosurgery:** Gram-positives (S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci)
- **Gynaecological:** Gram-positives, Gram-negatives, and anaerobes
- **Urological:** E. coli and other Gram-negatives

## When Indicated
- Prophylaxis is indicated in procedures with a high associated rate of infection, specifically in clean-contaminated and contaminated wounds.
- *Note:* The use of antibiotics in the presence of a dirty wound is for the treatment of established infection and is not considered prophylaxis.
- Indicated when a prosthesis is used.
- **Patient-related factors:**
  - Poor nutritional status
  - Obesity
  - Diabetes
  - Smoking
  - Extremes of age
  - Immune-system compromise (e.g., corticosteroid therapy, HIV, chemotherapy, or systemic illness)
  - Long duration of hospitalization prior to the procedure
  - Colonization with specific bacterial strains

## Adverse Effects
- Drug allergy
- Anaphylaxis
- Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea
- Clostridium difficile infection
- Antibiotic resistance

## Special Patient Populations
- **Patients colonized or recently infected with multi-drug resistant pathogens:**
  - Consider extending antibiotic coverage based on the sensitivity of the bacteria and the proximity of the probable site of colonization to the surgical site.
  - For MRSA colonization, include vancomycin in the prophylactic regimen.
- **Patients receiving antibiotics for an infection at a different site:**
  - If the current antibiotic regimen covers the expected pathogens at the surgical site, administer an extra dose within 60 minutes of incision.
  - If not, administer the recommended prophylaxis for the procedure independent of their current antibiotic therapy.
- **Pregnancy:**
  - Pre-incision administration of prophylactic antibiotics reduces maternal infectious morbidity significantly without adverse outcomes in the neonate, according to robust meta-analyses.

## Timing
- Antibiotics should be administered within 60 minutes of skin incision to reduce SSI rates.
- **Exceptions:**
  - Fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides (e.g., vancomycin) should be started 120 minutes before skin incision due to their infusion requirements.

## Dose
- Standardized doses are convenient for adults; however, in obese patients, adjustments may be necessary to achieve optimal tissue concentrations.
- **Cefazolin dosing recommendations:**
  - 1 g for adults weighing under 80 kg
  - 2 g for patients over 80 kg
  - 3 g for patients over 120 kg
- **Gentamicin dosing recommendation:**
  - Use ideal body weight plus 40% of the difference between total and ideal body weight.
- In patients with renal and liver dysfunction, no modification of antibiotic prophylaxis is needed for a single preoperative dose.

### Redosing
- Additional doses are required if the procedure duration exceeds two half-lives of the drug to maintain therapeutic tissue concentrations.
- Redosing is also necessary in cases of more than 1,500 ml blood loss.
- In patients with renal dysfunction, consider a longer interval until re-dosing.
## Doses and Re-dosing Intervals for Commonly Used Antibiotics

|Antibiotic|Adult Dose|Paediatric Dose|Re-dosing Interval (hours)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Amoxicillin/clavulanate|1.2 g|30 mg/kg of amoxycillin component|4|
|Cefoxitin|2 g|40 mg/kg|2|
|Cefazolin|2 g ≥ 80 kg, 3 g ≥ 120 kg|25–30 mg/kg|4|
|Ciprofloxacin|400 mg|NA*|NA*|
|Clindamycin|900 mg ≥ 70 kg, 600 mg < 70 kg|10 mg/kg|6|
|Fluconazole|400 mg|6 mg/kg|NA*|
|Gentamicin|5 mg/kg|2.5–5 mg/kg|NA*|
|Levofloxacin|500 mg|10 mg/kg|NA*|
|Metronidazole|500 mg–1 g|15 mg/kg|NA*|
|Piperacillin-tazobactam|4.5 g|Infants 2–9 mo: 80 mg/kg of piperacillin component|2|
|||Children > 9 mo: 100 mg/kg of piperacillin component|2|
|Vancomycin|15 mg/kg|15 mg/kg|NA*|

*NA – Not applicable due to prolonged half-life of the drug

## Duration of Prophylaxis

- Consistent evidence indicates that prophylaxis for the duration of the procedure is sufficient. Extended prophylaxis does not provide additional benefit.
- **Cardiothoracic procedures:**
	- Continuing prophylaxis for 48 hours postoperatively is controversial and not supported by evidence. The appropriate duration is for the procedure only, though some guidelines suggest continuation for up to 24 or 48 hours.
- **Hip and knee arthroplasty:**
	- While 24-hour postoperative prophylaxis is regarded as the gold standard, a recent systematic review found no evidence to support this practice. Further large, multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are recommended to evaluate this practice.
