# Resuscitative Endpoints

## Introduction

**There are three groups of resuscitative endpoints:**

1. Basic endpoints–blood pressure, heart rate, urine output.
2. Macrohaemodynamic targets–cardiac output, preload.
3. Microcirculatory or perfusion targets–global (lactate, base deficit) and regional (near infrared spectroscopy, regional capnography).

## Basic Endpoints

### Blood Pressure

**Advantages:**
- Easily accessible.
- Cheap.
- Non-invasive or invasive.
- Continuous measurement.
- Reproducible.

**Disadvantages:**
- NIBP not recommended in shocked patients with altered vascular tone (algorithmic derivation of SBP and DBP may be incorrect).
- “Normal” MAP may be different for each patient and for different shock pathologies (e.g., hypotensive resuscitation in haemorrhagic shock).
- Pressure does not equate to flow.

### Heart Rate

**Advantages:**
- Easily accessible.
- Continuous.

**Disadvantages:**
- Drugs, pain, anxiety, pacemakers, and other variables can also affect heart rate, making it not necessarily an indicator of shock.

### Shock Index

- **Formula:** Shock index = heart rate / SBP
- **Interpretation:** If > 0.5-0.7, shock more likely present. Higher values indicate worse prognosis.

**Advantages:**
- Same as HR and BP.

**Disadvantages:**
- Poor sensitivity.
- Cannot be used to target shock therapy in isolation.

### Urine Output

**Advantages:**
- Widely available.
- Relatively easy to obtain.

**Disadvantages:**
- Not continuous (requires time to assess response).
- Can be affected by drugs and chronic disease.
- Oliguria does not necessarily indicate ongoing shock.

### Mental Status

- **Indicator:** Mentation will be reduced if there is cerebral hypoperfusion.

**Disadvantages:**
- Other drugs (e.g., alcohol) and pathologies (e.g., head injury) can affect assessment.

## Macrohaemodynamic Targets

### Preload

#### Static Variables
- Central Venous Pressure (CVP)
- Pulmonary Artery Catheter (PAC)
- Global End-Diastolic Volume (GEDV)

#### Dynamic Variables
- Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV)
- Stroke Volume Variation (SVV)
- Systolic Pressure Variation (SPV)
- Passive Leg Raise Test

## Microcirculatory or Perfusion Targets

### Global

#### Mixed Venous Saturation or Central Venous Saturation

- **Principle:** Reflects the balance of oxygen delivery and consumption.
- **Measurement:** True mixed venous saturation (SvO2) requires a pulmonary artery catheter; central venous/superior vena cava oxygen saturation (ScvO2) may be similarly reflective.
- **Thresholds:** Values of >70% for ScvO2 and >65% for SvO2.

**Considerations:**
- Increased tissue metabolism will reduce mixed venous saturation.
- Poor microcirculatory function or mitochondrial cytopathy in septic shock may elevate mixed venous saturation, potentially even to normal levels.

#### Lactate and Lactate Clearance

- **Evidence:** Resuscitation targeted at reducing lactate results in superior outcomes compared to ScvO2 targets.

#### Base Deficit

#### Delta CO2

- **Definition:** The difference between venous and arterial PCO2.
- **Indication:** Increased when there is decreased cardiac output and/or tissue hypoperfusion.
- **Threshold:** A difference of >6 mmHg correlates with poorer outcomes.

### Regional

#### Regional Capnometry

- **Principle:** Tissue hypoxia results in acidosis, producing CO2 from buffering H+ ions by HCO3-.
- **Sites:** Gastric tonometry (splanchnic bed), sublingual capnometry.
- **Indicators:** Increased CO2 at these sites indicates poor regional perfusion.
- **Threshold:** Sublingual capnometry has a positive predictive value of 1 for circulatory shock with a threshold value of 70 mmHg.
- **Tissue-Arterial CO2 Gap:** A value >25 mmHg indicates higher mortality.

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires new equipment and special training.

#### Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)

- **Measurement:** Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) is calculated.
- **Usage:** Used to monitor brain tissue oxygen saturation during cardiopulmonary bypass, carotid, and other surgeries. Now examined as a regional perfusion monitor in shock.
- **Application:** Sensor placed on the thenar eminence.
- **Threshold:** StO2 < 78% indicates poor outcome.
- **Occlusion/Reperfusion Slope:** Indicates flow; a steeper slope indicates good peripheral flow.

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires expensive new equipment.

#### Sidestream Dark Field Video Microscopy

- **Technology:** Handheld video microscope with a ring of stroboscopic LEDs. Green light (penetrates up to 3 mm) absorbed by hemoglobin in capillaries creates high contrast videos of blood flow through the vascular bed.
- **Application:** Used as a goal in septic shock resuscitation, targeting perfusion of >80% of visible vessels, showing reduced mortality in small studies.

**Disadvantages:**
- Cost.
- Limited to examining the sublingual area in critically ill patients.
## Algorithm for Goal Directed Therapy for Patient Undergoing Major Surgery

**Initial Assessment:**
- SaO₂ > 94%
- Hb > 8 g/dL
- Temperature > 36°C

**Volume Responsiveness:**
1. **Assess Volume Responsiveness:**
   - If volume responsive, give a bolus.
   - If not volume responsive, proceed to the next step.

2. **Evaluate Cardiac Index:**
   - If Cardiac Index < 2.5:
	 - Consider inotropes.
	 - If not indicated, proceed to the next step.

3. **Evaluate Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):**
   - If MAP < 60 mm Hg:
	 - Consider vasopressor.
	 - If not indicated, proceed to the next step.

4. **Check SvO₂ and Lactate:**
   - If necessary, reassess the initial parameters (SaO₂, Hb, Temp) and repeat the evaluation.

**Reevaluation:**
- Continuous reassessment and adjustments based on the patient's response to interventions.
