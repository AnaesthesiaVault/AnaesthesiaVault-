# Renal Protection

## Strategies

1. **Identifying Patients at Risk of AKI**
   - Assess patient history and clinical factors that increase susceptibility to AKI.

2. **Maintaining Adequate Intravascular Volume, Cardiac Output, and MAP**
   - Aim for a higher MAP (70-80 mmHg) to prevent secondary renal injury.
   - Ensure stable cardiac output.

3. **Preventing Hypoxia**
   - Monitor and maintain optimal oxygenation levels.

4. **Preventing Hyperthermia**
   - Use active cooling methods as needed.

5. **Monitoring Intra-abdominal Pressure (IAP) and Preventing Fluid Overload**
   - Regularly assess IAP and manage fluid administration carefully.

6. **Carefully Managing Nephrotoxic Factors**
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications when possible.
   - Monitor drug efficacy and toxicity.

7. **Recognizing Drug Utility in Specific Clinical Situations**
   - Use medications judiciously according to patient condition and procedure requirements.

*(Also applicable to peri-procedural management of patients at risk of CIN and peri-operative prevention of AKI)*

## Contributing Factors to Renal Injury

- **Hypotension**
- **Dehydration**
- **Sepsis**
- **Nephrotoxic Drugs**

## Methods Used to Protect Kidney Function During Surgery

- **Medications**: Dopamine, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and hydration fluids.
  - A recent Cochrane database review concluded that there is no evidence that these interventions protect the kidneys from damage.

## Protecting Against Nephrotoxic Drugs

- **Adequate Hydration**: Ensure patients are well-hydrated prior to procedures.
- **Avoid Concomitant Nephrotoxins**: Monitor drug efficacy and toxicity.
- **Avoid Perioperative NSAIDs**: Particularly in hypovolemic, hypotensive, elderly, diabetic, CKD patients, and those on ACE inhibitors/ARBs.
- **Avoid Antihypertensives Post-op if Normotensive/Hypotensive**: Adjust medication regimens accordingly.
- **Tailor Antibiotic Dosing Intervals**: Adjust according to drug class and patient renal function.
- **Minimize Radiocontrast-Induced Kidney Injury**: See relevant protocols.

# Mechanism of Drug-Induced AKI

- **Direct Toxic Effect**: On renal tubules leading to cellular injury.
- **Crystal-Induced Tubular Injury**: Luminal obstruction.
- **Renal Interstitial Inflammation**: Acute interstitial nephritis.
- **Indirect Nephrotoxicity**: Impaired renal perfusion.
- **Impaired Pharmacokinetics**: In critically ill patients, leading to overdose and delayed clearance.
- **Drug Interactions**: Example: Clarithromycin + CCBs/NSAIDs/ACE inhibitors/ARBs ⇒ severe hypotension and AKI.

# Perioperative Causes of AKI

- **Hypotension**: Regardless of cause.
- **Hypovolemia**: Insufficient blood volume.
- **Fluid Overload**: With raised intra-abdominal pressure.
- **Low Cardiac Output States**: Reduced blood flow to kidneys.
- **High Cardiac Output States**: With profound vasodilation and capillary leak.
- **Direct Trauma or Embolism**: To kidneys or renal arteries during surgery.
- **Metabolic Derangement**: Conditions like liver failure or hyperthermia.
- **Nephrotoxic Drugs and Dyes**: Including hemoglobin and myoglobin.

# ICU Recommendations for Renal Protection

### Fluid Management

- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake, avoid fluid overload.
- **Avoid Starches, Gelatins, and Dextrans**: Use albumin if colloid is needed in septic shock.
- **Prophylactic Volume Expansion**: To prevent contrast-associated AKI.

### Diuretics

- **Control Fluid Overload**: Diuretics can be used but not for preventing AKI.

### Vasopressors

- **Maintain MAP**:
  - 65-70 mmHg in normotensive patients.
  - 80-85 mmHg in hypertensive patients with septic shock.
  - Recommended vasopressors: Noradrenaline (vasopressin in vasoplegic shock post-cardiac surgery).

### Metabolic Management

- **Blood Glucose**: Target <10 mmol/L.
- **Nutritional Support**: Ensure adequate nutrition.

### Drug Management

- **Statins**: Short-term use of atorvastatin to prevent contrast-induced AKI in high-risk patients undergoing coronary angiography.
- **Contrast**: Use the lowest dose possible, prefer isoor low-osmolar iodinated contrast.
- **N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)**: Oral NAC is out of favor (2017 working group).
- **Avoid Nephrotoxic Drugs**: Monitor and manage potential nephrotoxins.

### Other Considerations

- **Monitor Intra-abdominal Pressure**: Raised IAP can cause kidney dysfunction.
