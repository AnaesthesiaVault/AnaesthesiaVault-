# Summary
- A large analysis revealed three risk factors as predictive of death after burns: age older than 60 yr, burn size greater than 40% body surface area, and inhalation injury.
- Mortality is a function of the number of risk factors present.
	- The mortality was 0.3, 3, 33, or 90%, depending on whether 0, 1, 2, or 3 risk factors were present, respectively

## The Lund–Browder Chart
- Is an age specific diagram that more precisely accounts for the changing body surface area relationships with age
- The Lund-Browder chart is used for more accurate assessment of burns, especially in pediatric patients, as it accounts for changes in body surface area with age. It involves a detailed diagram that should be completed during initial evaluation, including wound size, location, and burn depth. TBSA (Total Body Surface Area) is calculated using this chart.

## Burn Shock

- Generalized edema, even in non-injured tissues, occurs when the injury exceeds 25-30% total body surface area (TBSA). After major burn injury, the continued loss of plasma into burned tissue can persist up to the first 48 hours or longer.
- Loss of intravascular fluid into burned areas and edema formation (in nonburned sites) can quickly result in burn shock, impairing tissue and organ perfusion.
- Burn shock occurs not only due to depletion of intravascular volume but also because of increased systemic vascular resistance (due to the release of catecholamines, antidiuretic hormone, and hemoconcentration) and depressed cardiac output.
- Depression of cardiac output occurs even before any detectable reduction in plasma volume. The depressed cardiac output continues for 24-36 hours. The hypermetabolic and hyperdynamic phase that develops 48-72 hours after injury is characterized by increased oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and protein wasting.
- The onset of sepsis further increases cardiac output and decreases systemic vascular resistance. Elderly patients may not exhibit signs of the hyperdynamic state, but protein catabolism is ubiquitous.

### Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

- **Pathogenesis:**
	
	- Thermal burn injury > 20% TBSA
	- Increased local and systemic inflammatory mediators
	- Endothelial cell damage, increased permeability
	- Shift of plasma and proteins to interstitial space
	- Protein concentration changes leading to oncotic pressure alterations
- **Clinical Findings:**
	
	- Hypovolemic shock due to decreased circulating blood volume
	- Hemoconcentration
	- Electrolyte imbalance
	- Cardiogenic shock from myocardial dysfunction
# Inhalational Injury

- The presence of an inhalational injury significantly increases the morbidity and mortality associated with burn injuries.
- Resuscitation fluid requirements are increased by up to 50%.
- Chest radiographs are usually normal until secondary complications of inflammation, infection, or atelectasis develop.
- Mechanisms of inhalational injury include:
	- Direct injury to the face and upper airway from inhalation of steam and/or hot gases.
	- Chemical injury to the trachea, bronchi, alveolar, and endothelial lining due to inhalation of toxic products from the fire.
	- Impairment of oxygen transport processes or oxygen utilization by inhalation of carbon monoxide and cyanide.
- Upper airway edema usually resolves in 3 to 6 days and is facilitated by elevation of the head of the bed and avoidance of excessive fluid administration.
- Tracheobronchial injury is caused by inhalation of chemicals in smoke. Smoke from a house fire contains combustion products that are toxic and damaging to the airways and alveoli.
- Decreased mucociliary transport impairs the clearance of bacteria and mucosal debris. Alveolar collapse and atelectasis can occur due to loss of surfactant production or from plugging of small airways by mucosal debris.
- Over time, these changes result in obstruction of airways, bronchospasm, atelectasis, and/or pneumonia, causing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, shunt, impaired gas exchange, and decreased pulmonary compliance.

# Depth of Burn
- The depth of skin destruction is characterized as first, second, or third degree, based on whether there is superficial, partial thickness, or full-thickness destruction of the skin
- Fourth degree is used to describe burns that have injured deeper structures, such as muscle, fascia, and bone.
- Deep secondand third-degree burns require surgical debridement and grafting, whereas more superficial burns do not

# Fluid Resuscitation for Burn Patients

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311152001.png)

- **Burns <15% TBSA:**
	- Managed with oral or intravenous fluid administered at 1.5 times the maintenance rate.
	- Careful attention to hydration status is essential.

### First 24 Hours: Parkland Formula

- **Parkland Formula (Usually underestimates):**
	- 4cc x %TBSA x weight (kg)
		- Example: 70 kg patient with 20% burn
		- Total fluid for 24 hours: Half in the first 8 hours, half in the next 16 hours.

### Fluid Resuscitation Formulae

- **Parkland Formula:**
	
	- Lactated Ringer’s (LR) 4 ml/kg/%TBSA Burn
	- Example: 70-kg person with 60% burn = 16,800 ml LR/24 hours.
- **Brooke Formula:**
	
	- LR 1.5 ml/kg/%TBSA Burn + Colloid 0.5 ml/kg/%TBSA Burn
	- Example: 70-kg person with 60% burn = 6,300 ml LR/24 hours + 2,100 ml colloid/24 hours.
	- **Note:** Half of the total volume is administered over the first 8 hours. Adjust based on physiological responses.
- **Additional Fluid Management:**
	
	- Goal-directed 10 ml/kg boluses may be needed, especially if inhalational injury is present (increases fluid requirements).

### Monitoring

- **Blood Pressure / Heart Rate:**
	- Not reliable due to edema, pain, and anxiety.
- **Urine Output:**
	- Adults: >0.5 ml/kg/hr (non-glycosuric).
	- Children: >1 ml/kg/hr.

### Fluid Choice

- **Balanced Crystalloids:**
	- Colloids are inappropriate due to increased capillary permeability.
	- Ringer’s Acetate is recommended to protect the electrolyte balance in large replacements.

### Blood Management

- **TBSA >20%:**
	- Can develop profound hemolytic anemia; transfusion may be necessary.

### Other Treatments

- **Mannitol:**
	- Forced diuresis for hemoglobinuria.
- **Vitamin C:**
	- Reduces ventilator days and fluid requirements.

### Clinical End Points

- **Urine Output:**
	- > 0.5 ml/kg/hr.
		
- **Heart Rate / Blood Pressure:**
	- Goal MAP >60 mmHg.
- **Lactate / Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation:**
	- Monitor for adequacy of resuscitation.

### Indicators of Adequate Circulating Volume and/or Resuscitation

- **Urine Output:**
	- 0.5-1.0 ml/kg/hr.
- **Blood Pressure:**
	- Within normal range for age.
- **Heart Rate:**
	- Variable.
- **Central Venous Pressure:**
	- 3-8 mmHg.
- **Fractional Excretion of Na+:**
	- <1% (indicates hypovolemia).
- **BUN/Cr Ratio:**
	- > 20 (indicates hypovolemia).
		
- **Base Deficit:**
	- <5 (suggests hypoperfusion).
- **Echocardiogram/Ultrasound:**
	- Normal stroke volume and ejection fraction.

# Anaesthesia for Burn grafting/excision
## Goals
- ATLS approach
- Secure definitive airway (facial/neck/inhalational or major burn) 
- Assess burn severity/extent
- Volume resuscitation (formula driven, goal directed)
- Measure CO levels with co-oximetry 
- Prevent end-organ dysfunction (lung protective strategy if ARDS, urine output >1ml/kg/hr)
- Adequate analgesia (multimodal approach +/- antidepressants)

## Preoperative Considerations for Burn Patients

### Major Preoperative Concerns

![](Pasted%20image%2020240703104437.png)

[View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.](https://whimsical.com/major-preoperative-concerns-JstkGDE4yQgt8yj3Uq4C2b?ref=chatgpt)

### Approach

- **Trauma Patient Protocol:** Follow Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines.
- **Difficult/Threatened Airway:** Consider edema, secretions, and bleeding. Be prepared for advanced airway management.
- **Potential Inhalational Injury:** Monitor for carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning.
- **Hypovolemia:** Implement goal-directed volume resuscitation (e.g., Parkland formula).
- **Intrahospital Transport Risks:** High adverse event rate (up to 70%) during transport of critically ill patients.

### Complications of Resuscitation

- **Abdominal Compartment Syndrome:** Monitor intra-abdominal pressure.
- **Fluid Creep:** Risk of pulmonary edema, venous congestion, and graft dysfunction.

### Frequent Operations (Debridement/Grafting)

- **Blood Loss:** Significant during burn excision operations (2.6-3.4% of blood volume per 1% TBSA excised).
- **Pain Management:** Consider opioid tolerance and the need for adequate analgesia.
- **Possible Remote Location:** Plan for additional logistical challenges.

### Multisystem Dysfunction

#### Acute Phase

- **Hypovolemic/Cardiogenic Shock:** Transition to septic shock/high cardiac output state.
- **Pulmonary Issues:** Risk of edema, aspiration, and restrictive lung disease.
- **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Monitor for hyperkalemia and myoglobinuria.
- **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):** Secondary to hypoperfusion or nephrotoxic agents.
- **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC):** Coagulopathy and risk of bleeding.
- **Anemia of Burns:** Frequent due to hemolysis and blood loss.
- **Impaired Thermal Regulation:** Difficulty maintaining normothermia.
- **Monitoring Challenges:** Difficulty in placing ECG patches, BP cuffs, and IV access.

#### Delayed Phase

- **Sepsis:** High risk due to immunosuppression and wound contamination.
- **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** Increased risk due to immobility and hypercoagulable state.
- **Stress Ulcers:** Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
- **Adynamic Ileus:** Gastrointestinal dysmotility.
- **Hypermetabolic/Catabolic State:** Increased nutritional needs and muscle wasting.

## Intraoperative Management in Burn Patients

### Securing the Endotracheal Tube (ETT)
- Avoid using tape or ties across burned areas to prevent wound irritation or graft injury.
- Secure the ETT with a carefully placed tie harness to prevent unintentional extubation.
- Consider circumferential ties around the patient's head, securing the tube to a tooth with wire, or using arch bars for safe fixation.

### Vascular Access
- If intravenous access is not available, temporary intraosseous cannulation is a safe alternative for patients of any age.

### Monitoring
- Use surgical staples to fix adhesive electrocardiogram electrodes.
- Alternative pulse oximetry sites include the ear, nose, or tongue if fingers or toes are unavailable.
- Consider an arterial line for continuous blood pressure measurement and blood sampling in cases of expected extensive bleeding.

### Temperature Monitoring
- Monitoring temperature is crucial as burn patients are prone to hypothermia.
- Temperature monitoring helps detect blood transfusion reactions intraoperatively (a rise of >2°C).
- Operating room temperature is typically maintained at 80 to 100°F (27 to 38°C) depending on patient age and burn severity.

### Pharmacologic Changes
#### Major Changes
- **Decreased Albumin**:
  - Affects acidic and neutral drugs.
- **Increased α1-Acid Glycoprotein (AAG)**:
  - Affects cationic drugs like lidocaine, propranolol, muscle relaxants, and some opioids.
  - AAG levels increase twofold or more in burn patients, decreasing the free fraction of AAG-bound drugs.
- **Increased Volume of Distribution (Vd)**.
- **Altered Drug-Receptor Interactions**:
  - Changes at target organs cause variable and unpredictable drug responses.

#### Hepatic Changes
- **Early Phase**: Reduced blood flow and clearance.
- **Late Phase**: Increased blood flow and clearance.
- **Enzyme Activity**: Altered enzyme activity in burn patients.
  - Phase I reactions (e.g., oxidation, reduction) are impaired.
  - Phase II reactions (e.g., conjugation, glucuronidation) remain relatively unaffected.

#### Renal Changes
- **Early Phase**: Reduced blood flow and clearance.
- **Late Phase**: Increased blood flow and clearance.

#### Initial Phase (<48h)
- Decreased cardiac output, renal, and hepatic blood flow reduce drug elimination.
- Hepatic clearance of highly extracted drugs decreases due to reduced liver and renal blood flow.

#### Delayed Phase (>48h)
- Increased cardiac output and blood flow to kidneys and liver.
- Increased clearance of drugs dependent on organ blood flow, requiring dose adjustments.
- Enhanced renal clearance due to increased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate.

#### Muscle Relaxants
##### Depolarizing
- Avoid succinylcholine administration 48 hours post-burn injury due to the risk of hyperkalemic response and potential cardiac arrest.
- Increased extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors release potassium during depolarization.
- Use high-dose non-depolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMRs), positive pressure ventilation, or deepen anesthesia for laryngospasm treatment in burn patients.

##### Non-Depolarizing Muscle Relaxants (NDMR)
- Increased doses required 3 to 7 days post-burn due to:
  - Up-regulation of acetylcholine receptors.
  - Increased AAG binding and enhanced renal/hepatic elimination.
- Increased rocuronium doses (1.2 to 1.5 mg/kg) recommended for rapid sequence induction.
- Atracurium effectiveness reduced, indicating a pharmacodynamic nature of resistance to NDMRs.

#### Anaesthetic Drugs
- **Propofol**: Increased clearance and volume of distribution during the hyperdynamic phase, requiring larger bolus doses or increased infusion rates.
- **Opioids**: Increased requirements due to opioid tolerance. Enhanced pain management is crucial. Changes in spinal cord receptors include down-regulation of μ-opioid receptors and up-regulation of protein kinase C-γ and NMDA receptors.
- **Ketamine**: Useful for induction and maintenance, associated with hemodynamic stability, and has potential anti-inflammatory effects. Benzodiazepines recommended to reduce dysphoria, and glycopyrrolate to manage increased secretions.

### Ventilation
- Use tidal volumes ≤6 ml/kg ideal body weight and maintain plateau airway pressures <30 cm H2O.

### Regional Anesthesia
- Central neuraxial techniques (spinals, epidurals) are effective as primary anesthetics and postoperative adjuncts.
- Epidural abscesses are not more common in burn patients, but intravascular catheters near burned tissue may become infected.

### Nutritional Support
- Continuous enteral or parenteral nutrition reduces the hypermetabolic response and muscle protein loss.
- Despite aggressive nutritional support, muscle mass loss continues post-wound coverage.
- Enteral feeding beyond the pylorus during surgery is successful with secured airways to prevent aspiration.

### Blood Loss and Fluid Management
- Colloids help limit the fluid needed to maintain preload.
- Limit subcutaneous fluid injections during wound debridement and donor harvest.
- Monitor hemodynamic, metabolic, and urine output for fluid replacement titration.
- Transfusion decisions should be based on maintaining adequate preload and metabolic status rather than hemoglobin or hematocrit levels.
- Anticipate continued blood loss and transfuse to prevent significant anemia.
- Blood loss during burn excision operations ranges from 2.6 to 3.4% of blood volume for every 1% TBSA excised.
### Post Operatively

#### Analgesia
- Posttraumatic stress disorder has been reported to occur in up to 30% of patients with severe burn injury, often developing in the setting of inadequate treatment of anxiety and pain
- Patient-controlled analgesia has been shown to be a safe and effective method of opioid delivery for acute or procedure related pain in both children and adults with burn injury
- Treatment of opioid tolerance includes switching of opioids (morphine → fentanyl → methadone) and coadministration of drugs acting on nonopioid receptors (ketamine–N-methyl-D-aspartate nonsteroidal antiiflammatory drugs antagonist, dexmedetomidineor clonidine-α2-agonist and gabapentin-like drugs).

|                            | Dexmedetomidine infusion                        |                         | Dexmedetomidine higher infusion rate                      | Morphine boluses                          |
|                            | Antipsychotics                                  |                         | Haloperidol (very slow) boluses                           | Morphine boluses                          |
|                            | Propofol infusion (<48h)                        |                         | Propofol boluses                                          | Morphine boluses                          |
| **Acute burn not ventilated** | Dexmedetomidine IV or scheduled lorazepam IV or PO | Morphine IV or PO       | Lorazepam IV/PO                                           | Morphine IV/PO or Ketamine IV             |
| **Chronic acute burn**     | Scheduled lorazepam or antipsychotics (PO)         | Scheduled morphine or methadone | Lorazepam or antipsychotics (PO)                         | Morphine PO or oxycodone                  |

# Electrical Injury

## Clinical Implications

- **Arrhythmias:**
	
	- Survivors of severe electrical shock frequently experience subsequent arrhythmias (10 to 46%).
	- Patients without electrocardiographic changes on presentation are unlikely to experience life-threatening arrhythmias.
- **Myocardial Damage:**
	
	- Damage to the myocardium can occur after exposure to either highor low-voltage current.
	- The myocardial injury resembles cardiac contusion more than myocardial infarction, with minimal hemodynamic consequences.
- **Thermal Injury to Bone and Muscle:**
	
	- Bone experiences the highest heat accumulation during high-voltage current flow due to its high resistance to electricity.
	- The high heat produced by bone injury damages surrounding muscles more than superficial muscle areas.
	- Subcutaneous tissue and skin have less damage as they are better conductors than bone.
- **Electrothermal Injury of Musculature:**
	
	- Manifests as edema formation and tissue necrosis.
	- Can lead to compartment syndrome and rhabdomyolysis.
	- Patients may require surgical intervention within 24 hours of injury.
- **Myoglobinuria:**
	
	- Resulting from muscle damage poses a risk for acute renal failure.
	- Requires prompt treatment with crystalloid loading to achieve a target urine output of 2 ml/kg/hr.

## Management and Treatment

- **Monitoring:**
	
	- Continuous monitoring for arrhythmias is crucial, even if initial electrocardiographic findings are normal.
- **Volume Resuscitation:**
	
	- Aggressive crystalloid loading is essential to prevent acute renal failure due to myoglobinuria.
	- Target urine output should be maintained at 2 ml/kg/hr.
- **Surgical Intervention:**
	
	- Early surgical evaluation and intervention may be necessary for decompression of compartment syndrome and removal of necrotic tissue.
	- Timely surgical intervention is crucial, typically within 24 hours of the injury.
- **Additional Considerations:**
	
	- Regular monitoring and supportive care to manage potential complications such as renal failure, compartment syndrome, and arrhythmias.
	- Multidisciplinary approach involving surgeons, intensivists, and nephrologists for comprehensive care.
