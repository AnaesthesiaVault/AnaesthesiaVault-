# Anaesthesia for Renal Transplants

## Preoperative Assessment

- Aim to limit cold ischaemic time.
- Important considerations:
	- Associated comorbidities.
	- Cardiovascular risk.
	- Fluid status.
- IV access history (including AV fistulas, dialysis lines, previously stenosed or thrombosed vessels).

## Anaesthesia

- **Induction**: Propofol with alfentanil or fentanyl.
	- RSI may be indicated if delayed gastric emptying is a concern.
- **Maintenance**: Volatile or TIVA.
- **Muscle relaxant**:
	- Atracurium.
	- Suxamethonium provided K+ < 5 mmol/L or high dose rocuronium as part of RSI.
	- Sugammadex (not licensed in severe renal impairment but appears safe and to provide complete reversal of blockade).

## Targets

- Warm and well perfused.
- Adequate MAP (ideally within 20% of baseline).
- Euvolaemia.
- CVP 10-15 mmHg.

## Monitoring and Access

- Monitoring as per AAGBI guidelines.
- Arterial line not essential unless indicated by comorbidities.
- NIBP on opposite side to AV fistula.
- 20G IV access is sufficient.
- Central venous access (dialysis line if no previous fistula).
- Oesophageal temperature probe and urinary catheter.

## Analgesia

- IV paracetamol.
- Fentanyl boluses titrated to effect (usually 200-300 mcg).
- TAP blocks or local infiltration by surgeons.
- Fentanyl PCA postoperatively.

## Fluid Management

- Important factor in post-transplant renal function.
- Typically require ~40 ml/kg crystalloid (0.9% NaCl).
- Colloid and blood rarely required.
- Caution regarding overzealous filling which can strain the myocardium.
- Transfusion trigger of 7 → may cause autoimmune activation and early graft rejection

## Suitability of Drugs Commonly Used During Transplantation Surgery

|**Use**|**Avoid**|
|---|---|
|**Volatile anaesthetics**: Iso/Sevo/Desflurane|Enflurane|
|**Neuromuscular blocking drugs**: Cis/atracurium|Pancuronium, Sugammadex|
|**Rapid sequence induction**: Rocuronium (1.2mg/kg), Succinylcholine (if K+ < 5mmol/l)|-|
|**Analgesics**: All fentanyl analogues|NSAIDS (Morphine)|
|**Diuretics**: Mannitol|Furosemide|

## Immunosuppressive Medications in Renal Transplantation

- **Calcineurin Inhibitors**:
	
	- Tacrolimus
	- Cyclosporine
- **Antiproliferative Agents**:
	
	- Mycophenolate Mofetil
	- Mycophenolate Sodium
	- Azathioprine
- **mTOR Inhibitor**:
	
	- Sirolimus
- **Steroids**:
	
	- Prednisone

# Anaesthetic Considerations in Recipients of Renal Transplants Presenting for Non-transplant Surgery

## Ongoing Management of Comorbidities
- **Diabetes Mellitus (DM)**
- **Hypertension (HPT)**
- **Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD)**
- **Dyslipidemia**
- **Vasculitis**

## Effects of Steroids and Immunosuppressants
- Consider potential side effects and interactions (source required for specific details).

## Drug Considerations (Depending on Renal Function)
- **Morphine**: Risk of accumulation of metabolites.
- **Non-depolarizing Muscle Relaxants (NDMR)**: Effects can be unpredictable.
- **NSAIDs**: Contraindicated regardless of renal function.

## Avoid Hypovolemia and Hypotension
- Important to prevent exacerbation of renal injury.

## Multisystem Disease and Renal Dysfunction
- Renal dysfunction is likely due to multisystem disease.
- Important to inquire about the primary disease (e.g., DM) and associated comorbidities (e.g., HPT, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD)).
- **Renal Function**: May have reduced GFR; check post-transplant baseline.

# Anaesthesia for Living Donor Renal Transplant Nephrectomy

## Classification of Renal Transplants by Donor Organ Source

1. **Deceased Donor**
	- Brainstem dead, heart-beating.
	- Non-heart-beating.
2. **Living Donor**
	- **Related**: The donor is genetically related to the recipient (parent, child, sibling, half-sibling, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, first cousin).
	- **Unrelated**
		- Emotional connection.
		- No emotional connection.
		- Altruistic.
		- Paired.
		- Pooled: Occasionally, more than two donors and two recipients will be involved in a swap. Each recipient gains from a transplant that they would not otherwise have had. The donors might not have given their kidney to the person they know, but that person will have received a kidney from one of the other pooled donors.
## Surgical Techniques Used for Living Donor Nephrectomy (LDN)

1. Open.
2. Laparoscopic LDN.
3. Hand-assisted laparoscopic LDN.
4. Robot-assisted laparoscopic LDN.

## Perioperative Anaesthetic Care Key Messages

- No routine prophylactic antibiotic (clean procedure).
- Comprehensive thromboembolism prophylaxis:
	- LMWH, graduated stockings, pneumatic compression devices.
- Consultant Surgeon and Consultant Anaesthetist present.
- Careful positioning to prevent pressure damage.
- Combination of local and regional anaesthesia with GA:
	- Epidural.
	- Paravertebral block.
	- Transverse Abdominal Plain Block.
	- LA catheter in wound.
	- Local infiltration by surgeon.
- Avoid Non-steroidal Antiinflammatory drugs.
- Wide bore IV access.
- Non-invasive monitoring, unless patient-specific indication.
- Fluid preloading (e.g. 1 litre of Normal Saline post-induction).
- Positive fluid balance throughout procedure.
- Avoid vasoconstrictors.
- Keep renal perfusion pressures / MAP at preoperative values.
- Heparin (e.g. 5000 IU) before the application of arterial clamp.
- Protamine (e.g. 50 mg) after kidney isolation.
- High normal urine output (>100 ml h^-1)–Mannitol 0.5 g kg^-1 can be used.
- Fentanyl PCA.
- Avoid hypothermia.

## Frequency of Complications

- Pneumonia: 9.3%.
- Pulmonary atelectasis: 7.4%.
- Urinary tract infection: 5.3%.
- Wound infection: 4.3%.
- Pneumothorax: 3.1%.

- Deep venous thrombosis: 0.2%.
- Intra-abdominal abscess: 0.2%.
- Other unspecified: 5.3%.
