# Conduct of Anaesthesia

## Cobb Angle
- Scoliosis is defined as a Cobb angle of more than 10 degrees.
- Surgery is considered if thoracic Cobb angle >50 degrees, lumbar >40 degrees.

## Considerations
- **Aetiology: idiopathic vs. non-idiopathic:**
	- Associated comorbidities (Marfan’s, NF, Scheuermann’s disease, DMD, congenital)
	- Evaluate the patient’s physiological baseline, cardio-respiratory reserve, and comorbidities.
- **Potential difficult airway** secondary to back curvature, neck involvement.
- **Prone positioning** and associated physiological changes, equipment required, risks of injury, and prevention.
- **Determine the degree of anticipated physiological disruption:** severity of correction, anticipated haemodynamic shifts.
- **Restrictive lung disease:**
	- Pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale; postoperative respiratory failure; prolonged ventilation.
- **Cardiac involvement** with idiopathic (MVP), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (cardiomyopathy, coarctation, CHD).
- **Patient temperature control.**
- **Neuromonitoring:**
	- Anaesthetic agents/TIVA.
- **Prevention of chronic pain** (ideally).
- **Spinal cord perfusion.**
- **Surgical consideration:** worse for kyphoscoliosis.
	- Blood loss; hypothermia; airway edema.
	- **Positioning:**
		- Prone: VAE, positioning injuries, POVL.
		- Lateral: OLV if thoracic approach.
	- **Monitoring:** wake-up test/SSEP/MEPs.
- **Post-op pain control:** clonidine, gabapentin, ketamine, opioids.

## Goals/Conflicts
- Avoid exacerbations of pulmonary hypertension (hypoxemia, hypercarbia, acidosis, hypothermia, light anesthesia & pain).
- Balance perfusion pressure to spinal cord vs. need for mild hypotension to minimize blood loss:
	- TXA, cell saver.
- Manage anesthetic agents to allow adequate monitoring of spinal cord integrity (SSEPs/MEPs).
- Vigilance for life-threatening complications of VAE or major vascular injury.
- Optimize for postoperative weaning from ventilation:
	- Dexmedetomidine, ketamine, acetaminophen, morphine infusions.

## Preoperative Assessment

### History & Examination
- Focus on pulmonary, cardiac, and neurological comorbidities.
- Baseline exercise tolerance.
- Respiratory baseline.
- Document neurological deficit.

### Investigations
- **CXR:** Cobb Angle.
	- >40 degrees: offered surgical stabilization. AIS usually has no or very little functional cardio-respiratory limitation or restrictive lung conditions.
	- >65 degrees: minor functional limitation → PFT.
	- >100 degrees: significant functional limitation → + ABG.
	- >124 degrees: severe alveolar hypoventilation, V/Q mismatch, respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension → RVF → + ECG, ECHO.
- **NIS:** Routine PFT, ABG, ECG, ECHO regardless of Cobb angle (especially in DMD with CMO).
- **Blood Tests:** FBC, U&E, G&S.

## Preoperative Investigations

### Respiratory System
**Minimum Investigations:**
- Plain chest X-ray.
- Arterial blood gases (ABG).
- Spirometry (FEV1, FVC).

**Optional Investigations:**
- Pulmonary function test (PFT) including bronchodilator reversibility.
- Pulmonary diffusion capacity.

### Cardiovascular System
**Minimum Investigations:**
- Electrocardiogram (ECG).
- Echocardiogram (Echo).

**Optional Investigations:**
- Dobutamine stress echocardiography.
- Dipyridamole/thallium scintigraphy.

### Blood
**Minimum Investigations:**
- Complete blood count.
- Clotting profile.
- Cross match.
- Urea/electrolytes.

**Optional Investigations:**
- Liver function tests.

### Optimization
1. **Nutritional:** Caloric supplementation.
2. **Anemia:** Hematinics, erythropoietin.
3. **PFT:** Plan post-op placement; treat RTI (Rx, defer); optimize reversible obstruction; physio, incentive spirometry, NCPAP for OSA.
4. **CVS:** RVF management.
5. **Pain:** Consult pain team for post-op plan.
6. **Premed:** Avoid long-acting hypnotics to prevent delayed emergence and EP interference.
7. **MDT involvement.**

## Intra-operative Management

### Preparation
- Two IV lines with claves.
- A-line and transducer.
- Convection warming blankets and warmers, temperature probe.
- Two TCI-capable TIVA pumps.
- Additional infusion pumps for Dexmedetomidine, Tranexamic acid, Phenylephrine infusions.
- BIS monitor.
- Cell saver.
- Group and Screen available at local Blood Bank.
- Wilson Frame/Jackson table or similar for optimal prone positioning, with headings, supports, and padding.

### Consider Dexmedetomidine
- Adjunct to decrease total Propofol dose; allows faster decrement and wake-up.
- Analgesic properties intraand post-op.
- Prevents chronic pain wind-up.
- Reduces remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia.
- Decreases spinal NMDA receptor phosphorylation, reducing spinal cord ischemic reperfusion injury via α2a receptor-mediated agonism.
- Useful for Stagnara Wake Up Test.
- Prevents disordered sleep post wake-up test.

### Anaesthesia Conduct

#### Induction Room
- No premed from the ward (Midazolam decreases MEPs).
- Counsel patients for Wake Up test (seldom used).
- Dexmedetomidine bolus as premed (monitor heart rate) 1 ug/kg-0.75 ug/kg over 15 min.
- Perfalgan 20 mg/kg IV over 15-20 minutes if possible (can be administered intra-op with minimal effect on MEPs).

#### Intra-operatively
- Apply all monitors including BIS.
- Administer 1-2 mg morphine (prevent hyperalgesia).
- Remifentanil:
	- 50 ug/ml TCI, Minto Cet or Sufentanyl as an alternative.
- Propofol 1% TCI, Schnider Cet.
- Lignocaine to prevent Propofol sting on induction.
- Induce with Remifentanil (or Sufentanyl) and Propofol as per usual TIVA.
- Intubate when deeply anaesthetized (no muscle relaxant, no gas).
- Maintain on air and oxygen (no nitrous oxide).
- Establish another large IV and A-line while urinary catheter is inserted and neuro-monitoring established.
- Ensure normothermia with a convection blanket.
- Prone patient as per hospital/dept policy, ensuring adequate positioning and padding of pressure points (recheck at regular intervals).

#### Administer
- Antibiotics (Kefzol).
- Tranexamic acid (10 mg/kg over 20 min followed by 1 mg/kg/hr).
- Recommence Dexmedetomidine at 0.5-0.8 ug/kg/hour.
- Ketamine 0.25 mg/kg every hour.
- Ensure adequate depth of anaesthesia during baseline MEP test.
- Infuse Remifentanil and Propofol at rates facilitating selected MAPs and adequate depth of anaesthesia as per BIS.
- Gradually decrease Propofol Cet as guided by BIS.

### Mean Arterial Pressure
- General rule of thumb:
	- MAPs 65-70 mmHg during surgical dissection for minimal bleeding.
	- MAPs 70-75 mmHg to facilitate spinal cord perfusion during instrumentation.
	- Preferably not to drop MAPs below 25-30% patient baseline.

### Vasopressors
- Phenylephrine or Ephedrine often required to maintain haemodynamic endpoints.
- Low-dose Phenylephrine infusions useful during the second stage of the procedure.
	- Caution against doses above 0.5 ug/kg/min due to impaired renal/SC perfusion.
	- Intra-operative discussion with the surgical team to determine optimal endpoints.
	- Inadvertent intra-operative cord injury would require supra-normal targets to prevent secondary injury (target MAPs of 80-90 mmHg for 24 hours post-injury).

### Inotropes
- Low-dose adrenaline infusion often more useful than ultra-high doses of Phenylephrine.
- Maintain patient core temperature (temps <35.5 associated with increased latency of evoked potentials).

### Fluids
- mRL, Volulyte, blood and products as required for physiological fluid maintenance and resuscitation of ongoing blood loss.
- Cell-saved blood preferable to blood bank.

### Wake Up
- Titrate morphine 0.1 mg/kg at least 30-40 minutes before wake-up in small increments.
- Decrease Remifentanil as appropriate.
- Ondansetron for PONV prophylaxis.
- 0.2% Bupivacaine for incision infiltration (ensure total concentration below toxic dose).
- Trust the decrement time on the TCI pump.
- Discontinue Propofol timely as predicted by Schnider to ensure patient wake-up.
- Alternatively, if hesitant, transition to Sevoflurane or Desflurane once the surgeon is happy with the last MEP measured.
- Discontinue Dexmedetomidine infusion for ease of transfer, recommence in ICU/High Care (0.3-0.5 ug/kg/hr).

## Complications
1. **Blood Loss:** Refer to relevant protocols.
2. **Hypothermia:** Pre-op warming, warm theatre, fluids, FAWD

, plastic, keep patient dry.

3. **Prone Position:**

	- Pressure points, tube dislodging, line displacement, etc.
	- Abdominal organ ischaemia.
	- Airway edema.

4. **Peripheral Nerve Injury:** Positioning, spinal cord/nerve root compression must be ruled out.
5. **Spinal Cord Injury:** Vigilance and preventive measures.

## Risk Minimization Strategies

### Careful Positioning

### Maintaining Spinal Cord Perfusion Pressure (SCPP)

- SCPP = MAP - CSFP
- CSFP can be reduced by CSF drainage
- MAP manipulated by anaesthetist
- Goal: Maintain systolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg

### Drugs

- Methylprednisolone (administered within 8 hours of insult)
- NMDA antagonists (ketamine, magnesium)

### Prevention of Hematoma Formation

- Careful hemostasis
- Preoperative: Stop anti-platelet medication
- Postoperative: Withhold heparin immediately

### Pain Management

- Multimodal approach (ketamine, dexmedetomidine, opioid infusions)

### Additional Considerations

- **Postoperative Visual Loss (POVL)**
- **Peripheral Nerve Injuries** from positioning
- **Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)**
- **Airway Compromise** (especially in cervical spine procedures)
	- Due to edema or hematoma
- **Postoperative MI/Stroke/Coagulopathy**
	- NB: Injury to the carotid can occur intraoperatively
- **Respiratory Complications** (opioid-induced respiratory depression)
- **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**
	- Especially if there is significant intraoperative blood loss and fluid shifts
- **Ileus**
- **Surgical Site Infection**

### Preventing Blood Loss

1. **Hemoglobin Optimization**: Pre-op with iron/erythropoietin; target ≥ 2 g/dL above transfusion trigger.
2. **Autologous Donation**: Pre-op if feasible.
3. **Group & Screen (G&S)**: Ensure valid specimen at the blood bank on the day of surgery.
4. **Prone Position**: Optimize to prevent venous engorgement.
5. **Maintain Normothermia**
6. **Normovolemic Hemodilution**
7. **Blood Pressure Management**: Carefully controlled relative hypotension (aim for MAP reduced by 25% of normal baseline in healthy patients).
8. **Tranexamic Acid**
9. **Transfusion Trigger**: 7-8 g/dL (no benefit for 10).
10. **Thromboelastography (TEG)**: Reduce need for blood products.
11. **Cell Salvage**
12. **Surgical Technique**: Use diathermy and hemostatics.

_Moderate patient-appropriate lowering of MAP during the surgical approach must be balanced with maintaining a MAP necessary for spinal cord perfusion._

## Postoperative Management

### First 24 Hours

- Routine post-op observations, including urine output.
- Regular neurological observations: half-hourly for the first 6 hours, then hourly for 24 hours (if morning case, then 2-hourly after midnight).
- Early feeding as appropriate.
- Guide nursing on haemodynamic and haemoglobin targets, maintenance fluid requirements, and troubleshooting pre-anticipated issues (e.g., over-sedation, bleeding, hypoventilation).
- Use TED stockings or calf compressors.
- **Clexane prophylaxis**: Administer the following day.
- **Medications**:
	- Cefsol 1g IV 8-hourly (3 doses)
	- Perfalgan 1g IV 6-hourly
	- Dexmedetomidine (0.3-0.5 ug/kg/hr, titrate to effect, avoid over-sedation)
	- Ketamine 0.25 mg/kg/hr IV infusion
	- Morphine IV infusion
	- Breakthrough pain: Morphine bolus 1-2 mg IV PRN, depending on patient age and weight
	- Tramadol PO as morphine is weaned (Targinact with Oxynorm for breakthrough if available)
	- Ondansetron PRN
	- Consider Gabapentin (conflicting evidence, side effects may be undesirable, reserved for specific cases).

### Post-op Day 2 (if Patient Condition is Amenable to Ward transfer)

- Aim for early mobilization and feeding.
- Stop IV analgesia.
- Step down to oral analgesia:
	- Paracetamol
	- Tramadol or Targinact (if available) with Oxynorm
	- Additional analgesia: Clonidine PO up to 2 ug/kg/bd (Dexmedetomidine discontinued)
	- PCA: Morphine/ketamine/droperidol or morphine/ketamine/ondansetron
	- Breakthrough morphine (IMI if patient is in ward, seldom required)

**NSAIDs**: While used to decrease opioid requirements in some hospitals, they are not routinely favored due to concerns about platelet dysfunction and bone healing. Best discussed with the surgical team. Our surgeons prefer to avoid NSAIDs with corrective spinal surgery.

## Analgesic Options for Pain Control in Scoliosis Surgery

### Epidurals
- Placed under direct vision.
- Risk: Infection with indwelling catheters.

### Wound Infusion Catheter
- Risk: Infection.

### Local Anaesthetic Infiltration

### Intrathecal Morphine

### NSAIDs
- Concerns: Platelet dysfunction and bone healing.
- Growing evidence suggests that ketorolac is safe.

### Dexmedetomidine Infusion
- Dosage: 0.3-0.5 mcg/kg/hr.
- Effect: Improves pain scores, but not significantly.

### Ketamine Infusion
- Dosage: 0.25 mg/kg/hr.
- Effect: Greater improvement in pain scores compared to dexmedetomidine.

### Morphine Infusion and Breakthrough Boluses

### Paracetamol

### Gabapentin
- Evidence: Conflicting.

### Considerations for Correction

**Peri-op issues**  
- Pre-op: Full cardiorespiratory evaluation, coag and blood
- Specific risks: Pain, Bleeding, paralysis, prone position, optimizing spinal cord perfusion
- May use neuro-monitoring (SSEP/MEP/Awakening)
- If due to muscular dystropy - prone to AE's of Sux (AIR, hyperkalaemia, sustained muscular contractures, myoglobinuria). Also avoid volatiles due to AIR risk.
- Post-op: May remain intubated if respiratory involvement is severe (FVC < 40%)
