## Introduction
- Soft tissue operations around the shoulder are frequently extremely painful. This pain is unpredictable and may last for several days, although it is typically worst within the first 48 hours.

## Conduct of Anaesthesia
- The patient is usually positioned with the head distal to the anaesthetist, requiring particular attention to the security of the airway.
  - It is often easier to intubate the patient (using a south-facing Ring, Adair, and Elwyn (RAE) or armoured tube), except for shorter procedures where a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) may be suitable.
  - Long ventilator and gas sampling tubes are required.
  - Venous access should be placed in the opposite arm (with a long extension) or at the ankle/foot.
- The patient may be placed supine, with head-up tilt, lateral, or in a deck-chair position.
  - When using a steep head-up tilt in patients with compromised cardiovascular function, change the posture slowly and consider direct arterial pressure monitoring.
  - There is a potential for air embolus while in these positions.
  - Although blood loss is rarely significant, patients may be unable to take oral fluids for some hours post-operatively.
- Regional anaesthesia is a useful adjunct in shoulder anaesthesia, and an interscalene block is the method of choice.
  - Procedures may be performed under regional anaesthesia alone, but it is more commonly used to supplement general anaesthesia (GA) and provide post-operative analgesia.
  - When planning an interscalene block, inform the patient that their whole arm may go numb and that they may sense that full inspiration is not possible when they wake up (due to phrenic nerve blockade).
  - Interscalene block is contraindicated in patients with contralateral phrenic nerve/diaphragmatic palsy or recurrent laryngeal nerve damage.
  - Interscalene catheters can be used for prolonged post-operative analgesia.
  - When an interscalene block is impractical, infiltration of local anesthetic (LA) by the surgeon may also provide post-operative analgesia.
  - A catheter can be placed in the subacromial space and used to instill further quantities of LA in the post-operative period. This is particularly effective in Bankart’s and capsular shift operations.
  - For rotator cuff repairs, an epidural catheter placed surgically over the repair can be used to supplement post-operative analgesia.
  - Regular boluses (10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine every 2-4 hours) are better than an infusion.
- Potent analgesia is often required for 1-2 days.
- The combination of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) opioid, NSAIDs, and paracetamol is usually effective.
- Good posture (sitting up with the elbow supported on a pillow) is also important.

## Considerations

### Pre-operative
- **History and examination**
  - Rheumatoid arthritis patients and elderly need careful consideration.
  - COPD patients and respiratory compromise.
  - Discuss interscalene block. Weigh up risk/benefit.

### Intra-op
- **IV access**
  - Wide-bore in contralateral arm.
- **Anesthesia options**
  - Regional alone.
  - Regional plus sedation.
  - Regional and general anesthesia (GA).
- **Interscalene block**
  - In awake patient with 20-30 ml of local anesthetic.
  - Consider catheter.
- **Beach chair position**
  - Venous pooling and cerebral ischemia.
  - Consider intravenous oxygen saturation (iVOS) and arterial line (a-line).
  - Airway may need to be secured.
- **Multimodal analgesia**
  - Local anesthetic into joint capsule.
- **Pressure points**
  - Especially eyes, face, elbows, axillary roll.

### Post-op
- **Multimodal analgesia**
  - Early mobilization.
- **Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)**
  - If block not performed.

## Regional Anaesthesia

### Dermatomes and Nerves
- **Transverse cervical (cervical plexus - ventral rami C2,3)**
- **Supraclavicular (cervical plexus - ventral ramus C4)**
- **Upper lateral cutaneous of arm (axillary, C5)**
- **Medial cutaneous of arm (medial cord of brachial plexus)**

### Shoulder Innervation
- **Acromioclavicular joint**
  - Supplied by suprascapular nerve (also provides some innervation to the capsule and the glenohumeral joint).
- **Capsule and glenohumeral joint**
  - Inferior aspect supplied by axillary nerve.
- **Variable contributions**
  - Possible minor contributions from the musculocutaneous and subscapular nerves.

### Shoulder Blocks
- A block of at least the upper two roots (C5 and C6) or the superior trunk of the brachial plexus is necessary.
- Blockade of the supraclavicular nerve is also needed, as this covers the ‘cape’ of the shoulder, i.e., the skin overlying the superior aspect of the shoulder.
- The interscalene approach is best suited for shoulder joint and upper arm surgery. Blockade occurs at the level of the roots as they exit between the middle and anterior scalene muscles at the C6 level (identified by the cricoid cartilage).
- The brachial plexus is quite spread out at this level, and even with large doses of LA, the lower roots (C8 and T1) may be left unblocked.
- This approach can lead to various complications, including blockade of the cervical sympathetic chain, recurrent laryngeal nerve, phrenic nerve, hypotension and bradycardia (Bezold-Jarisch reflex), accidental epidural and spinal injection, and potential permanent damage to the spinal cord if attempted under general anaesthesia.
- Catheter placement into the brachial plexus allows continuous local anaesthetic infiltration for painful procedures, such as shoulder arthroplasties, and facilitates earlier mobilization. This technique, however, does not provide superior postoperative analgesia compared to intra-articular catheter placement.
- Regional analgesia for shoulder arthroscopy can be achieved by means of a suprascapular nerve block, but this is not adequate as a sole technique and must be combined with general anaesthesia.
# Beach Chair Position in Shoulder Surgery

## Benefits
- **Lower incidence of brachial traction injuries**
- **Decreased risk of neurovascular complications**
- **Decreased operative time**
- **Easier conversion from arthroscopic to open surgery**

## Physiologic Effects of Sitting Position

### Central Nervous System (CNS)
- **Decreased cerebral perfusion**
  - Correct mean arterial pressure (MAP) for hydrostatic differences between blood pressure cuff and brain; place transducer at the level of external auditory meatus if using an arterial line.
	- 1 cm rise = 0.75 mmHg drop in MAP.
  - Compounded by effects of general anesthesia (GA) and sitting position on cerebral autoregulation.
  - Decreased intraocular pressure (IOP) and intracranial pressure (ICP).
- **Possible cerebral oxygen desaturation** (unrelated to hemodynamics).
- **Avoid excessive head flexion**
  - Prevent tongue swelling.

### Cardiovascular System (CVS)
- **Venous pooling in lower extremities**
  - Decreased preload, stroke volume (SV), MAP, cardiac output (CO) (~20%), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).
  - Mitigation techniques include:
	- IV fluids
	- Hip flexion to 100 degrees with leg elevation
	- Bending knees
	- Compression stockings
	- Gradual head elevation.

### Respiratory System
- **Increased functional residual capacity (FRC) and lung compliance**
- **Poor access to airway**
  - Use endotracheal tube (ETT) and check for movement of ETT with flexion.

## Potential Complications
- **Nerve injuries**
  - Brachial plexus, ulnar nerve, and sciatic nerve can be stretched or compressed.
  - Spinal cord injury if significant neck flexion occurs.
  - Support arms in padded gutters to avoid brachial plexus and shoulder traction injuries.
- **Pressure injury**
  - Over ischial tuberosity.
- **Excessive neck flexion**
  - Vascular obstruction in the neck.
  - Kinking/obstruction of ETT or supraglottic device (SGD).
  - Tongue/oropharyngeal swelling.
- **Venous air embolism**
  - Can cause hypoxia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest (25-75% in neurosurgery cases in the sitting position).
- **Pneumocephalus**
- **Stroke, ischemic brain injury, and death**
- **Decreased venous return**
  - Hypotension and reduced cerebral perfusion.
