# Conduct of Anaesthesia
## Summary

## Pre-operative

- **Co-morbidities**
- **Cardiorespiratory reserve**
- **DVT prophylaxis**
### Preoperative Risk Factors for Persistent Post-Surgical Pain (PPSP)

**Psychosocial Characteristics**

- Pain catastrophizing (exaggerated fear about pain)
- Poor coping mechanisms
- Mental health issues (depression/anxiety)

**Pre-existing Pain**

- Longstanding severe joint pain
- Multiple joint pain
- Neuropathic pain-like symptoms (e.g., burning, shooting, electric shock-like pain, allodynia, hyperalgesia)

**Medication**

- Chronic opioid use

## Intra-operative

- **GA vs Regional**
	- Regional associated with reduced pain scores, less opioid-related adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression, reduced blood loss, and reduced incidence of DVT.
- **Femoral nerve block plus GA/spinal**
- **Standard monitoring**
	- Invasive monitoring for cardiac patients
- **Antibiotics**
- **Fluid management and blood loss**
- **Hypothermia**
- **Cement reaction**
- **Tourniquets**

### Neuraxial Vs GA

- **Post-operative analgesia:** Neuraxial anaesthesia (NA) provides the best immediate post-operative analgesia.
- **Early in-hospital recovery:** GA/TIVA possibly comparable to NA for pain, mobilisation, and PONV.
- **Post-operative complications:** NA is not inferior to GA (if no contraindications for NA).
- **Subpopulations benefiting from NA:**
	1. Pulmonary disease
	2. Risk of OSA
	3. High risk of acute postoperative pain (see TJA analgesia card)
	4. Old age

## Post-operative

- **Analgesia:**
	- Neuraxial: epidural vs spinal with morphine
	- Peripheral nerve block
	- Systemic opioids: PCA pump
	- NSAIDs (with caution)
	- Regular paracetamol
	- Intra-articular analgesia
- **Thromboprophylaxis**
- **Early mobilization**

## Options for Analgesia in Total Joint Arthroplasty

1. **Multimodal Analgesia (MMA)**: Paracetamol + NSAID - good evidence for THA, not as good for TKA
2. **Gabapentinoids**: Neither pregabalin nor gabapentin is associated with a clinically relevant decrease in in-hospital or long-term pain scores. Possible benefit for patients at high risk for developing severe acute postoperative pain (e.g., chronic opioid-consuming patients, preoperative neuropathic pain, severe preoperative chronic pain).
3. **Peripheral Nerve Blocks**
# Neuraxial Anaesthesia in Patients Receiving Anticoagulations

**Warfarin**

- Ensure normal INR before neuraxial technique
- Remove catheter when INR < 1.5

**Unfractionated Heparin**

- Administer 1 hour after neuraxial technique
- Remove catheter 2-4 hours after last dose

**Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH)**

- Preoperative: Wait 10-12 hours after last dose
- For treatment dose: Delay for at least 24 hours
- Postoperative (single daily dose): Administer 6-8 hours after operation
- Postoperative (twice daily dose): Administer 24 hours after operation

**Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)**

- No contraindication

**Thienopyridine Derivatives**

- Clopidogrel: Discontinue for 7 days
- Ticlopidine: Discontinue for 14 days

**Fondaparinux**

- Actual risk unknown; should be done in clinical trials

**Direct Thrombin Inhibitors**

- Insufficient information

**Thrombolytics**

- Absolute contraindication
# Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) for Total Joint Arthroplasty (TJA)

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a care package of evidence-based interventions used in a multimodal, integrated clinical care pathway to achieve improved functional outcomes and rapid recovery.

## Aims of ERAS Protocols
- To reduce perioperative stress response
- Maintain/support homeostasis and physiological function
- Accelerate the achievement of discharge criteria
- Minimize complications

## ERAS Protocols for Total Joint Arthroplasty

### Preoperative
- **Education**
- **Nutrition**
  - Carbohydrate loading
- **Liberal fasting**
- **Optimization**
  - Detect and correct anemia
- **Active prewarming**
- **Preemptive oral analgesia**

### Intraoperative
- **Regional anaesthesia**
  - Spinal, combined spinal-epidural (CSE), peripheral nerve blocks (PNB), local infiltration analgesia (LIA)
- **Short-acting sedative-hypnotic agents**
- **Goals**
  - Maintain normothermia
  - Blood conservation
  - Antibiotic prophylaxis

### Postoperative
- **Multimodal opioid-sparing analgesia**
- **PONV prophylaxis**
- **Early mobilization**
- **Early oral intake**

### Audit
- Continuous improvement and audit

## Introduction and Evidence

There is persuasive evidence that ERAS concepts can be effectively applied to orthopaedic surgery, particularly elective hip and knee arthroplasty. Compared with standard care, patients on a clinical pathway experience significantly fewer postoperative complications. These include:

- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
- Pulmonary embolism (PE)
- Requirement for manipulation
- Superficial and deep infections
- Decubitus ulcers

Additionally, patients on ERAS protocols have a shorter hospital length of stay, reduced from 6 to 3 days, with no change in readmission rates. The most marked decrease in length of stay is observed in patients aged 85 years or older, without any increase in morbidity and mortality. Overall, ERAS protocols contribute to lower hospital costs.

# Consensus Statement for Perioperative Care in Total Hip Replacement and Total Knee Replacement Surgery: ERAS® Society Recommendations

#### Anaemia
- Preoperative anaemia should be identified, investigated, and corrected prior to hip and knee replacement.

#### Preoperative Fasting
- Intake of clear fluids is recommended until 2 hours before the induction of anaesthesia.
- A 6-hour fast for solid food is recommended.
- **Carbohydrate Loading:**
  - May improve patient well-being and metabolism in hip and knee replacement but has not been shown to accelerate discharge or reduce complications, thus not recommended as a routine intervention.

#### Pre-anaesthetic Medication
- Routine administration of sedatives to reduce anxiety preoperatively is not recommended.

#### General vs. Central Neuraxial Anaesthesia
- Both modern general anaesthesia and neuraxial techniques may be used as part of multimodal anaesthetic regimens.

##### Spinal (Intrathecal) Opioids
- Spinal opioids are not recommended for routine use.

#### Epidurals
- Epidural analgesia is not recommended for routine use in hip and knee replacement due to potential adverse effects delaying recovery.

#### Local Anaesthetics for Nerve Blocks and Infiltration Analgesia
- **Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA):**
  - Recommended for knee replacement within a multimodal opioid-sparing regimen.
  - Not recommended for hip replacement.
- **Nerve Blocks:**
  - Provide equal analgesia but may limit early and safe mobilisation due to prolonged motor blockade.
  - Not recommended as an essential ERAS component.

#### Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)
- Screening for and multimodal PONV prophylaxis and treatment is supported for patients undergoing hip and knee replacement.

#### Prevention of Perioperative Blood Loss
- **Tranexamic Acid:** Recommended to reduce perioperative blood loss and the requirement for postoperative allogenic blood transfusion.

#### Multimodal Analgesia
- Routine use of paracetamol is recommended.
- Routine use of NSAIDs is recommended for patients without contraindications.
- Gabapentinoids are not currently recommended as an adjunct in a multimodal analgesia regime; further studies are needed.
- **Supplemental Opioid Analgesia:**
  - Minimised in ERAS programmes but may include opioids such as oxycodone when required as part of a multimodal approach.

#### Maintaining Normothermia
- Normal body temperature should be maintained periand postoperatively through pre-warming and active warming intraoperatively.

#### Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
- Systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered according to local policy and availability.

#### Antithrombotic Prophylaxis Treatment
- Patients should be mobilised as soon as possible post-surgery and receive antithrombotic prophylaxis treatment according to local policy.
