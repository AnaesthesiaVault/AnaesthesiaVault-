### Background

- **Procedures**: Lobectomy, segmentectomy, wedge resection
- **Indications**: Hepatic metastases, benign and malignant primary hepato-biliary tumors, liver donation for transplantation, trauma
- **Liver Anatomy**: Highly vascular, receives 25% of cardiac output, 80% of blood supply via portal vein, 20% via hepatic artery
- **Risks**: Increased risk of multi-organ dysfunction if underlying hepatic disease

### Considerations

- **Potential for Massive Blood Loss**
	- Need for invasive monitors and access
	- Increased risk in cases of:
		- Repeat surgery
		- Porta hepatis lesions
		- Lesions near large vessels
		- Large resections
		- Portal hypertension
		- Right-sided resections
- **Postoperative Risks**
	- Liver dysfunction and coagulopathy
	- Hypoglycemia during vascular occlusion and post-resection
	- Altered drug metabolism with liver dysfunction
	- Decreased cardiac output and increased LV afterload during temporary blood supply occlusion
	- Transient IVC compression and decreased venous return due to surgical manipulation
- **Potential Co-Morbidities**
	- Cancer-related issues (mass effects, medications, metastases, metabolic abnormalities)
	- Liver disease, alcohol abuse, hepatitis C, carcinoid

### Goals and Conflicts

- **Overall Goals**: Avoid and manage postoperative liver dysfunction, minimize blood loss, avoid hepatotoxins

#### Preoperative

- **Assessment**
	- Evaluate cardiopulmonary function to tolerate surgery
	- Focused history and examination (pathology, planned surgery, comorbidities, baseline liver function)
	- Routine tests: FBC, U&E, LFT, Coags
	- Special tests: PFT, ABG, ECHO
	- PHLF screening: CT/MRI volumetric analysis, Indocyanine green clearance
- **Risk Stratification**
	- Assess risk of postoperative liver failure based on resection extent and underlying liver disease
	- Safe resection limits: 50-80% liver removal in young patients with normal liver
	- Increased risk with significant alcohol consumption
	- Extent of liver disease assessment: Child-Pugh B and C (likely contraindicated for liver resection)
	- Preoperative portal vein embolization to induce liver hypertrophy if necessary

#### Intraoperative

- **Monitoring and Access**
	- BP, CVC, CO monitoring, TOE, large bore IV lines, blood products, cell salvage, temperature management
- **Drug Management**
	- Use Desflurane/Isoflurane, Atracurium/Cisatracurium
	- Avoid hepatotoxic drugs
- **Hemodynamics**
	- Total hepatic vascular exclusion (THVE) vs selective hepatic vascular exclusion (SHVE)
	- Minimize CVP to reduce blood loss:
		- Limited pre-resection IV fluids (max 1 ml/kg/hr)
		- Vasopressors to maintain perfusion pressure
		- Reverse Trendelenburg positioning, diuretics, NTG infusion, minimize PEEP
- **Surgical Techniques**
	- Intraoperative ultrasound for tumor detection and resection planning
	- Consider TXA
	- Maintain normothermia, normal pH, normal Ca2+, normoglycemia
	- Monitor and correct coagulopathy
	- Consider N-acetylcysteine for ischemia-reperfusion injury (mixed evidence)
- **Pain Management**
	- Thoracic epidural cautiously considered due to risk of postoperative coagulopathy
	- Alternatives: single-shot neuraxial opioids, IV opioid PCA, continuous wound infusion catheters

#### Hepatic Vascular Occlusion Techniques and Hemodynamics

**Inflow and Outflow Occlusion:**

- **THVE:**
	- Heart rate: ↑↑ (50%)
	- Mean arterial pressure: ↓↓↓
	- Systemic vascular resistance: ↑↑↑ (80%)
	- Cardiac output: ↓↓↓ (60%)
- **SHVE:**
	- Heart rate: ↑ (2-5%)
	- Mean arterial pressure: ↑
	- Systemic vascular resistance: ↑
	- Cardiac output: ↓

**Inflow Occlusion:**

- Heart rate: ↑↑
- Mean arterial pressure: ↑↑ (15%)
- Systemic vascular resistance: ↑↑ (40%)
- Cardiac output: ↓ (10%)

**Hepatic Pedicle Occlusion (Pringle Manoeuvre):**

- Continuous or intermittent occlusion of portal vein and hepatic artery

**Selective Inflow Occlusion:**

- Hemihepatic or segmental clamping (used for portal hypertension)

### Fluid Management

- **Pre-resection**: Limit IV fluids, maintain BP and urine output, target low CVP (< 5 mmHg)
- **SVV Monitoring**: SVV > 10% predicts low CVP, acceptable up to 20% during resection
- **Fluid Choice**: Acetate-buffered solutions preferred over lactate-buffered solutions
- **Drugs and Techniques**: NTG, diuretics, volatiles, reverse Trendelenburg, PEEP, normovolemic hemodilution
- **Vasopressors**: Maintain MAP within 20% of baseline
- **Complications**: Inadequate organ perfusion, VAE

### Postoperative Management

1. ICU admission
2. Monitor for postoperative fever
3. Monitor for bleeding and coagulopathy
4. Watch for PHLF (≥ day 5): Presents with hyperbilirubinemia and increased INR
5. Maintain euvolemia, glucose, electrolytes, and phosphate supplementation
6. Monitor for liver dysfunction and coagulopathy: Glucose infusion, correction of coagulation and electrolyte abnormalities
7. Common to develop significant ascites within 48 hours, monitor for hypovolemia
8. Avoid acetaminophen until liver function normalizes

### Preoperative Elements

1. Counselling
	- Dedicated preoperative counselling.
2. Minimal fasting. Adhere to fasting guidelines, 6 hours for solids and 2 hours for liquids
3. Preoperative carbohydrate load
4. No oral MBP
5. Avoid long-acting anxiolytics
6. VTE prophylaxis. Anti-thrombotic prophylaxis should be used.
7. Perioperative nutrition. Attention to perioperative nutrition especially if BMI < 18, albumin < 30 g/dl and weight loss > 10-15%. Depending on severity, supplement for 7-14 days preoperatively.

### Intraoperative Elements

8. Antimicrobial prophylaxis (single dose) and skin preparation (2% chlorhexidine)
9. Routine thoracic EA cannot be recommended; wound infusion catheters or intrathecal opioids can be used alternatively combined with multimodal analgesia.  
10. Minimally invasive approach if performed by a skilled surgeon.  
11. Perioperative steroids
12. Maintain normothermia
13. Perioperative glycemic control
14. Routine prophylactic nasogastric tube not indicated.  
15. Abdominal wound catheter/intrathecal opioids instead of epidural analgesia*
16. Prevention of PONV

### Surgery Related

14. Maintain low CVP during liver resection and use of balanced crystalloids
15. Avoid Mercedes Benz incision
16. Minimally invasive surgery where appropriate*
17. Avoidance of nasogastric tube*
18. Prevention of DGE by omental flap for left-sided resection

### Postoperative Elements

19. Early oral intake
20. Early mobilization
21. Multimodal analgesia
22. Maintain normoglycaemia postoperatively with insulin therapy.  
23. Prevention of delayed gastric emptying by an omental flap after left sided hepatectomy.  
24. Stimulation of bowel movement not indicated postoperatively.
