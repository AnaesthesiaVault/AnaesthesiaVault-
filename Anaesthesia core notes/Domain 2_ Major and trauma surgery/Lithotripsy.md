# Lithotripsy

## Introduction

### Procedure
- Non-invasive fragmentation of renal stones using pulsed ultrasound.
- Duration: Usually 20-40 minutes.
- Anesthesia: General Anesthesia (GA) or Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA).

### Historical Context
- Initially, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) required patients to be suspended in a water bath in a semi-sitting position, causing issues for anesthetists.
- Advancements in the 1980s eliminated the need for a water bath.
- Recent refinements in ultrasound technology have reduced discomfort, making anesthesia or sedation necessary for only a few patients.

## Conduct of Anesthesia for Lithotripsy

## Preoperative

- **Patient History:** Refer to previous treatment records due to potential repeated lithotripsy.
- **Premedication:** Paracetamol or NSAIDs, considering renal function.

## Perioperative

- **Positioning:** Lateral position with arms above the head.
- **Procedure:** Renal stones located using ultrasound or image intensifier; shock wave focused on stones.
- **Antibiotics:** Prophylaxis may be required.

## Postoperative

- **Pain Management:** Mild discomfort can be managed with oral analgesics or NSAIDs.

## Special Considerations

- **Dysrhythmias:** Shock waves can cause occasional dysrhythmias, usually self-limiting. Persistent dysrhythmias can be managed by timing shock waves with ECG (refractory period). Anticholinergics (e.g., glycopyrronium 200 micrograms) can increase heart rate and the frequency of delivered shocks.
- **Pacemakers:** Shock waves can deprogram pacemakers; seek advice from a pacemaker technician.
- **Energy Release:** Shock wave energy is released at air/water interfaces. Use saline, rather than air, for 'loss of resistance' when siting an epidural.
