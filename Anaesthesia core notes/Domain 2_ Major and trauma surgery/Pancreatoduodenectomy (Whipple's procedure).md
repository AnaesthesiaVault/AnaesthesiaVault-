### Summary of Updated ERAS Recommendations 2019 (Published in 2021 World Journal of Surgery)

#### 1. **Preoperative Counseling**

- **Recommendation**: Preoperative counseling should include multimedia informational materials rather than relying solely on spoken information or pamphlets.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Weak

#### 2. **Prehabilitation**

- **Recommendation**: A prehabilitation program starting 3–6 weeks before major surgery reduces postoperative complications and preserves functional status.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 3. **Preoperative Biliary Drainage**

- **Recommendation**: Avoid preoperative biliary drainage unless necessary for decompression (bilirubin >250 µmol/L, cholangitis, or neoadjuvant therapy).
- **Evidence**: High
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 4. **Preoperative Smoking and Alcohol Cessation**

- **Recommendation**: Smoking cessation for at least 4 weeks is advised to reduce wound and respiratory complications. Alcohol cessation is recommended for heavy users but not clearly beneficial for moderate users.
- **Evidence**: Smoking: Moderate; Alcohol cessation (high users): High; Alcohol cessation (moderate users): Low
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 5. **Preoperative Nutrition**

- **Recommendation**: Nutritional intervention is recommended for patients with >15% weight loss or BMI <18.5 kg/m². Assessment should be based on self-reported pre-morbid weight.
- **Evidence**: High for >15% weight loss; Moderate for general nutritional status.
- **Recommendation**: Strong for >15% weight loss; Weak for general assessment.

#### 6. **Perioperative Oral Immunonutrition**

- **Recommendation**: Immunonutrition is not recommended.
- **Evidence**: High
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 7. **Preoperative Fasting and Carbohydrate Treatment**

- **Recommendation**: Fasting can be limited to 6 hours for solids and 2 hours for liquids in low-risk patients. Carbohydrate loading is recommended.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 8. **Pre-anesthetic Medication**

- **Recommendation**: Pharmacologic anxiolytics should be avoided, particularly in the elderly. Opioid-sparing multimodal pre-anesthetic medication (e.g., acetaminophen, gabapentinoids) is advised. NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors can be initiated postoperatively if renal function is stable.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 9. **Anti-thrombotic Prophylaxis**

- **Recommendation**: LMWH or UFH should be started 2–12 hours preoperatively and continued until discharge. Extended thromboprophylaxis (4 weeks) is advised after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for cancer. Mechanical measures should complement chemical thromboprophylaxis.
- **Evidence**: High
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 10. **Antimicrobial Prophylaxis and Skin Preparation**

- **Recommendation**: Administer a single dose of intravenous antibiotics within 60 minutes before incision. Alcohol-based preparations are preferred for skin preparation.
- **Evidence**: High
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 11. **Epidural Analgesia**

- **Recommendation**: Thoracic epidural anesthesia for open PD improves analgesia, reduces pulmonary complications, and enhances postoperative recovery.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 12. **Postoperative Intravenous and Oral Analgesia**

- **Recommendation**: A multimodal opioid-sparing strategy is recommended, tailored to institutional expertise.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 13. **Wound Catheter and Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block**

- **Recommendation**: Continuous wound infiltration through a preperitoneal catheter is an alternative to epidural for open PD.
- **Evidence**: High
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 14. **Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) Prophylaxis**

- **Recommendation**: Patients with ≥2 PONV risk factors should receive two antiemetics; those with ≥3 risk factors should receive two to three antiemetics.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 15. **Avoiding Hypothermia**

- **Recommendation**: Active warming should be initiated preoperatively if temperature <36°C and maintained intraoperatively. Patients should not be discharged from PACU until temperature >36°C.
- **Evidence**: High
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 16. **Postoperative Glycemic Control**

- **Recommendation**: Perioperative glucose levels should be maintained close to normal without inducing hypoglycemia.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 17. **Nasogastric Intubation**

- **Recommendation**: Avoid maintaining nasogastric intubation after surgery.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 18. **Fluid Balance**

- **Recommendation**: Avoid fluid overload using a goal-directed fluid therapy algorithm.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 19. **Perianastomotic Drainage**

- **Recommendation**: Early drain removal at 72 hours is recommended if amylase content in the drain is <5000 U/L on POD1.
- **Evidence**: Moderate to high
- **Recommendation**: Strong for early removal; Weak for no-drain regimen

#### 20. **Somatostatin Analogues**

- **Recommendation**: Routine use of somatostatin analogues to reduce POPF is not recommended.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Weak

#### 21. **Urinary Drainage**

- **Recommendation**: Urinary catheters can be removed on the first postoperative day or when the patient is ambulatory.
- **Evidence**: Low
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 22. **Delayed Gastric Emptying**

- **Recommendation**: There is no proven strategy to prevent DGE, but early treatment of complications may reduce its duration.
- **Evidence**: Low
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 23. **Stimulation Of Bowel Movement**

- **Recommendation**: Chewing gum and Alvimopan may accelerate recovery from ileus. Mosapride shows promise, but other drugs (e.g., metoclopramide) are ineffective.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 24. **Postoperative Artificial Nutrition**

- **Recommendation**: Patients should be allowed a normal diet postoperatively as tolerated. Enteral nutrition is preferred if artificial nutrition is needed.
- **Evidence**: Moderate
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 25. **Early And Scheduled Mobilization**

- **Recommendation**: Early mobilization from postoperative day 0 is recommended, though specific protocols or targets are lacking.
- **Evidence**: Low
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 26. **Minimally Invasive Surgery**

- **Recommendation**: Laparoscopic PD (LPD) should only be performed in high-volume centers with experienced surgeons. Robotic-assisted PD (RAPD) cannot be recommended at this time.
- **Evidence**: Moderate for LPD; Low for RAPD
- **Recommendation**: Strong

#### 27. **Audit**

- **Recommendation**: Regular audit and feedback via an electronic database are crucial for improving compliance and outcomes.
