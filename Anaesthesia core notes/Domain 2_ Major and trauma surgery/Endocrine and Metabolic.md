## Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240129140923.png)

## Thyroid Physiology

### Thyroid Hormone Synthesis and Regulation
- **Dietary Iodine Conversion:** Dietary iodine is converted to iodide in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Iodide is then transported to the thyroid gland where it is combined with tyrosine to form thyroid hormones.
- **Thyroid Hormone Formation:** The combination of iodide and tyrosine in the thyroid gland results in the formation of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). These hormones are bound to proteins and stored in the thyroid gland.
  - T4 is released in greater quantities than T3.
  - T3 is more potent, less bound to protein, and is primarily formed from the peripheral conversion of T4.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** The synthesis of thyroid hormones (TH) is regulated by a feedback mechanism involving the hypothalamus (which releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone, TRH), the anterior pituitary (which releases thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH), autoregulation, and iodine intake adequacy.

### Effects of Thyroid Hormones
- **T3 Effects:**
  - **Heart:** Increases inotropy (via increased β-cell expression) and chronotropy (via increased α-MHC), causes vasodilation from increased temperature, and increases cell metabolic rate.
  - **Metabolism:** Increases lipolysis, gluconeogenesis, and basal metabolic rate (BMR).
  - **Growth and Development:** Stimulates nerve myelination and axon growth.
  - **Respiratory System:** Increases oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, leading to increased ventilation (V̇E).
  - **Central Nervous System (CNS):** Affects mood.
  - **Musculoskeletal System (MSK):** Promotes protein catabolism.
- **Mechanism of Action (MOA):** T3 crosses the cell membrane, binds to receptors in the nucleus, and regulates gene transcription. This leads to increased mRNA and protein synthesis, resulting in larger and more numerous mitochondria.

### T3 Vs T4
- **T3:**
  - Constitutes 10% of thyroid hormone output.
  - Highly protein-bound (primarily to albumin).
  - Strongly active with a half-life of 24 hours.
- **T4:**
  - Constitutes 80% of thyroid hormone output.
  - Highly protein-bound to thyroxine-binding globulin.
  - Weakly active with a half-life of 7 days.

### Hormone Synthesis Process
- **Iodine Absorption:** Iodine is absorbed in the stomach, reduced to iodide, and transported to the thyroid gland.
- **Iodide Uptake:** Iodide is taken up into thyroid follicular cells via iodide trapping, which imports it through the Na⁺/I⁻ co-transporter along a steep gradient.
- **Iodide Transport and Conversion:** It is transported through the colloid and released intraluminally, where hydrogen peroxide converts it back to iodine.
- **Combination with Tyrosine:** Iodine combines with individual tyrosine residues on the thyroglobulin chain, formed by the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA).
- **Formation of DIT and MIT:** This combination, dependent on thyroid peroxidase, forms diiodotyrosine (DIT) or monoiodotyrosine (MIT).
- **Formation of T3 and T4:** Thyroid peroxidase combines these further to form T4 (DIT + DIT) or T3 (DIT + MIT), which are then stored in vesicles until release.

This synthesis and regulatory process ensures the body maintains appropriate levels of thyroid hormones, which are crucial for metabolism, growth, and overall physiological function.

## Interpreting Abnormal Thyroid Function Tests

### Normal Ranges
- **Serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) Concentration**: 0.4–4.5 mU/litre
- **Serum Free T4 Concentration**: 9.0–25.0 pmol/litre
- **Serum Free T3 Concentration**: 3.5–7.8 pmol/litre

## Thyroid Surgery Approach (Airway)

### Preoperative Considerations

#### History and Examination
- **Thyroid Status:** Evaluate for hyperthyroidism (symptoms: anxiety, heat intolerance, weight loss, tachycardia, tremor, atrial fibrillation) or hypothyroidism; patient should be clinically and biochemically euthyroid.
- **Clinical Manifestations:** Assess for symptoms related to thyroid disease, with a focus on cardiopulmonary systems.
- **Goitre Assessment:** Evaluate for compressive symptoms.
- **Airway Examination:** Routine airway tests plus history of positional dyspnea, voice changes, dysphagia, and stridor.
- **Goitre Palpation:** Assess if the goitre extends retrosternally.
- **SVC Obstruction:** Look for distended neck veins not altered by respiration, and consider Pemberton's sign.
- **Other Endocrine Disorders:** Screen for associated endocrine conditions.

### Preoperative Investigations

#### Blood Tests
- Full blood count (FBC)
- Urea and electrolytes (U&E)
- Thyroid function tests (TFTs)
- Calcium
- Magnesium
- Phosphate
- Alkaline phosphatase
  - **Note:** In cases of medullary thyroid carcinoma, measure calcitonin and urinary metanephrines.

#### Radiographic Imaging
- **Chest X-ray:** Assess tracheal deviation and narrowing.
- **Thoracic Inlet Views:** Evaluate tracheal compression and retrosternal goitre.
- **CT Thorax:** Indicated for malignancy staging, retrosternal goitre, and airway compression; estimates endotracheal tube size.
- **MRI Thorax:** Provides additional information via sagittal and coronal slices.

#### Cardiorespiratory Assessment
- **Electrocardiography (ECG)**
- **Echocardiography:** Recommended if there is suspicion of ischemia, cardiac failure, or arrhythmia.

#### Other Investigations
- **Nasendoscopy/Laryngoscopy:** Indicated for malignancy, airway concerns, or previous neck surgery; further assesses airway and vocal cord function.

### Intraoperative Management

- **Anesthesia:** Usually general anesthesia (GA) with endotracheal tube (ETT) ± superficial cervical plexus block or wound infiltration.
- **Airway Management Options:**
  - Video laryngoscopy (VL)
  - Gas induction with sevoflurane and antisialogogue
  - Fibreoptic intubation if the larynx is displaced, with care to avoid complete obstruction
  - Awake tracheostomy or cricothyroidotomy may not be realistic options
  - Ventilating rigid bronchoscope: Surgical team can aid in ventilation if ETT fails, especially with subglottic obstruction.
  - Consider cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for extensive retrosternal extension.
- **Use THRIVE (Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange)**
- **Eye Care:** Vigilant to avoid tying ETT circumferentially, which can cause engorgement.
- **Dexamethasone:** Administer 8 mg to reduce airway swelling.
- **Intraoperative Nerve Monitoring (IONM):** Avoid muscle paralysis, consider remifentanil (Remi).
- **Extubation:** Extubate fully awake, sitting up, and spontaneously ventilating (SV); perform a leak test and consider direct withdrawal under vision due to the risk of tracheomalacia.

- **Drugs that Inhibit Thyroid Hormone Synthesis:**
	- Propylthiouracil
	- Methimazole
- **Drugs to Prevent Hormone Release:**
	- Potassium iodide
	- Sodium iodide
- **Adrenergic Symptom Management:**
	- Propranolol: Masks signs of adrenergic overactivity.
	- β-Adrenergic Antagonists: Decrease peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, though they do not affect thyroid gland function directly.

#### Radioactive Iodine

- **Mechanism:** Destroys thyroid cell function.
- **Outcome:** May result in hypothyroidism.
- **Contraindication:** Not recommended for pregnant patients.

#### Surgical Treatment

- **Subtotal Thyroidectomy:**
	- Rarely used as an alternative to medical therapy.
	- Typically reserved for patients with large toxic multinodular goiters or solitary toxic adenomas.
### Anaesthetic Considerations for Thyroidectomy

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314172725.png)

#### Preoperative Management

- **Timing of Surgery:**
	- Surgery is postponed until the patient is clinically and chemically euthyroid with normal T3 and T4 levels and no resting tachycardia.
	- **Elective Surgery:** Defer if hyperthyroid (6-8 weeks). If urgent, manage with β-blockers, iodide, propylthiouracil (PTU) via nasogastric tube (NG), and glucocorticoids (dexamethasone).
- **Medication Management:**
	- Continue antithyroid medications and β-adrenergic antagonists on the morning of surgery.
- **Thyroid status**
	- Clinically and biochemically
- **Preoperative Assessment:**
	- **Goitre Duration:** Long-standing tracheal compression may indicate tracheomalacia.
	- **Positional Breathlessness:** Assess the airway.
	- **Neck Examination:** Check for retrosternal extension.
	- **Signs of SVC Obstruction:** Look for distended neck veins that do not vary with the respiratory cycle.? need for nasendoscopy or CPB on standby. If SVC syndrome present drip in lower limb
	- **Stridor:** Check for presence. Compressive symptoms (positional dyspnoea, altered voice, dysphagia or stridor)
	- **Neck Movement:** Assess range of neck movements and avoid extending beyond normal range during surgery.
- **Imaging:**
	- **Chest X-ray (CXR):** Assess tracheal deviation and narrowing (overestimates airway diameters).
	- **CT Scan:** Advisable if there are symptoms of narrowing (e.g., stridor, positional breathlessness) or >50% narrowing on radiograph. Accurately delineates the site and degree of airway encroachment or intraluminal spread. Retrosternal extension (CT/ clinically/ Chylothorax, pleural and pericardial effusions, phrenic and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsies and Horner's syndrome may also indicate retrosternal extension)
#### Intraoperative Management

- **Eye Care:** Ensure eye padding, lubrication, and taping.
- **Regional Anesthesia:** Consider a superficial cervical plexus block.
- **Circulation Management:** Control hyperdynamic circulation with esmolol infusion.
- **Monitors** Neuromonitoring. Avoid or reverse muscle relaxants
- **Anesthetic Considerations:**
	- Avoid ketamine and ephedrine.
	- Patients may be volume depleted and have an exaggerated response to induction.
	- Inadequate anesthetic depth during laryngoscopy or surgical incision can lead to tachycardia, hypertension, or ventricular arrhythmias.
	- Neck dissection = stimulation of carotid sinus = vagal response
	- No influence on minimum alveolar concentration (MAC).
	- Titrate non-depolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMR) due to possible coexisting myasthenia.
- PACHU/ICU if airway concerns

#### Managing a Difficult Thyroid Airway

- **Teamwork:** Involve ENT specialists.
- **Induction:**
	- Inhalational induction with sevoflurane.
	- Use of topical local anesthetic (LA).
	- Fibreoptic intubation: May be challenging in awake patients with stridor as the narrowed airway can be obstructed by the instrument. Useful if there is marked laryngeal displacement or coexisting intubation difficulties.
- **Backup Option:**
	- Ventilation through a rigid bronchoscope if endotracheal tube (ETT) placement fails.
### Thyroid Storm

#### Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314172803.png)

#### Presentation
- **Symptoms:** Hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, altered consciousness (e.g., agitation, delirium, coma), and hypotension.
- **Timing:** Usually occurs 6 to 24 hours after surgery, but can occur intraoperatively.
- **Differentiation from Malignant Hyperthermia:** Thyroid storm is not associated with muscle rigidity, elevated creatine kinase, or marked metabolic (lactic) and respiratory acidosis.
#### Management
- **Endocrinology Consultation**
- **Correction of Precipitating Causes:** Address underlying issues such as infection.
- **Supportive Measures:**
  - Increase inspired oxygen
  - Check blood sugar levels (BSL)
  - IV fluid hydration
  - Paracetamol and tepid sponging for fever
  - Electrolyte correction
  - Inotropes and vasopressors if needed

## Hypothyroidism

### Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314135335.png)

### Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

![[Pasted image 20240904150005.png]]

[View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.](https://whimsical.com/pathogenesis-and-clinical-findings-AbdthQJvZ1aKTAouEmaewN?ref=chatgpt)

### Causes

- Autoimmune disease (e.g., Hashimoto thyroiditis)
- Thyroidectomy
- Radioactive iodine
- Antithyroid medications
- Iodine deficiency
- Failure of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis (secondary hypothyroidism)
- Hypothyroidism during neonatal development can result in cretinism, characterized by physical and mental retardation

### Severity Classification

**Severe Hypothyroidism**

- Patients with myxedema coma, severe clinical symptoms of chronic hypothyroidism (e.g., altered mentation, pericardial effusion, heart failure)
- Very low levels of total thyroxine (T4) (e.g., <1.0 mcg/dL) or free T4 (e.g., <0.5 ng/dL)

**Moderate Hypothyroidism**

- Patients with overt hypothyroidism (elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], low free T4) without severe clinical features

**Mild Hypothyroidism**

- Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, defined by normal serum free T4 with elevated serum TSH

### Clinical Manifestations

- Infertility, weight gain, cold intolerance, muscle fatigue, lethargy, constipation, hypoactive reflexes, dull facial expression, depression
- In advanced cases: decreased heart rate, myocardial contractility, stroke volume, and cardiac output; cool and mottled extremities due to peripheral vasoconstriction
- Pleural, abdominal, and pericardial effusions are common

### Diagnosis

- **Primary Hypothyroidism:** Elevated TSH concentration, reduced free (or total) T3 level
- **Secondary Hypothyroidism:** Normal TSH, reduced T3. Normal TSH despite reduced T3 (euthyroid sick syndrome or nonthyroidal illness syndrome) often seen after major operations and in chronic and critical illnesses

### Treatment

- Oral replacement therapy with thyroid hormone preparations
	- Takes several days to produce a physiological effect and several weeks for clear clinical improvement
## Anaesthesia for Hypothyroidism

### General Considerations

- Mild to moderate hypothyroidism is typically acceptable for surgery.
- Continue thyroid medications (e.g., levothyroxine) due to their long half-lives (approximately 8 days).
- Preferred induction agents: ketamine or etomidate.
- Consider Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol.

### Specific Concerns

#### Airway

- Potential difficulty due to swollen oral cavity, edematous vocal cords, and goiter.
- **Preparation:** Anticipate and prepare for difficult airway management.

#### Cardiovascular System (CVS)

- Hypodynamic circulation characterized by decreased cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), baroreceptor reflexes, and intravascular volume.
- **Risk:** Prone to intraoperative hypotension.
- **Monitoring:** Consider invasive monitoring ± transesophageal echocardiography (TOE).
- **Management:** Use ephedrine, dopamine, adrenaline (not phenylephrine), ± steroids, ± milrinone (avoid dependence on desensitized β-receptors).

#### Respiratory System

- Decreased ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia and hypercarbia.
- **Management:** Mandatory mechanical ventilation, avoid spontaneous ventilation.

#### Gastrointestinal System

- Increased aspiration risk due to delayed gastric emptying.
- **Management:** Use metoclopramide and rapid sequence induction (RSI).

#### Hematological System

- Potential for anemia, platelet dysfunction, and coagulopathy (especially factor VIII deficiency).

#### Metabolic System

- Risks include hyponatremia, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia.
- **Management:** Use dextrose saline as needed.

#### Pharmacology

- Decreased hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.
- **Sensitivity:** Increased sensitivity to narcotics, sedatives, and anaesthetic drugs.

### Preoperative and Intraoperative Management

- **Elective Surgery:** Postpone until the patient is euthyroid.
- **Emergent Surgery:**
	- Administer levothyroxine (T4) 300-500 µg IV infusion.
	- Administer liothyronine (T3) 25-50 µg IV infusion.
	- Administer dexamethasone or hydrocortisone.

### Complications

#### Myxedema Coma

- Characterized by extreme hypothyroidism with symptoms such as coma, hypoventilation, hypothermia, hyponatremia (due to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), and congestive heart failure
- Common in older adults
- Often precipitated by infection, surgery, or trauma
- Life-threatening condition treated with intravenous T3
- ECG monitoring is necessary to detect myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias
- Routine steroid replacement (e.g., hydrocortisone, 100 mg IV every 8 hours) due to frequent coexisting adrenal gland suppression
- May require ventilatory support and external warming

# Parathyroid

## Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)

- **Bone:**
	- Increases resorption of calcium and phosphate.
- **Kidney:**
	- Increases reabsorption of calcium.
	- Decreases reabsorption of phosphate.
	- Increases conversion of 25-OHD₃ to 1,25(OH)₂D₃ (active vitamin D).
	- Decreases reabsorption of bicarbonate.
- **Intestines:**
	- Indirectly increases calcium absorption via increased renal production of active vitamin D.

## Calcitonin

- **Bone:**
	- Inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption.
- **Kidney:**
	- Decreases reabsorption of calcium and phosphate.
- **Intestines:**
	- Inhibits phosphate reabsorption.
	- Increases renal excretion of sodium and calcium.

## Vitamin D
- **Nature and Synthesis:**
	- Steroid hormone absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract or synthesized from cholesterol derivatives.
	- UV exposure facilitates the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D₃.
	- Subsequent hydroxylation in the liver and kidneys produces 1,25(OH)₂D₃ (active vitamin D).
- **Physiological Actions:**
	- Binds to vitamin D receptors (VDRs) to exert its effects.
	- Promotes normal growth and remodeling of bone.
	- Regulates calcium and phosphate concentrations.
- **Bone:**
	- Maintains calcium homeostasis.
- **Kidney:**
	- Decreases calcium reabsorption (less significant than PTH).
- **Intestines:**
	- Increases calcium absorption.

### Anaesthetic Considerations

#### Pre-op

- Ca²⁺ must be < 3 mmol/L.

#### Intra-op

- General anesthesia, armored endotracheal tube (ETT), ± superficial cervical plexus blocks (no evidence that any technique improves outcomes).
- General measures: Extended lines (due to tucking), pressure points padding (PPP) (osteoporotic patients).
- Unpredictable response to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMRs); monitor closely.
- Possibility of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury; extubate deep and inspect vocal cord function (spontaneous ventilation).

#### Post-op

- Complications as for thyroid surgery, plus hypo-Ca²⁺.

# Adrenal Gland

## Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240129141341.png)

## Adrenal Gland Physiology

### Overview

The adrenal gland is composed of two main regions: the cortex and the medulla, each responsible for producing different types of hormones.

### Cortex

- **Hormones**: Androgens, mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone), and glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol).
### Medulla

- **Hormones**: Catecholamines (primarily epinephrine, with smaller amounts of norepinephrine and dopamine).
### Hormones and Their Functions

#### Aldosterone

- **Function**:
	- Promotes sodium and water reabsorption from the collecting ducts.
	- Stimulates potassium and hydrogen ion secretion.
	- Net effect: Expands extracellular fluid volume, resulting in fluid retention, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.
- **Stimuli for Secretion**:
	- Angiotensin II (AG2)
	- Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
	- Metabolic acidosis
	- Hyperkalemia
	- Conditions like hypovolemia, hypotension, congestive heart failure, and the neuroendocrine stress response to surgery elevate aldosterone levels.

#### Glucocorticoids (e.g., Cortisol)

- **Function**:
	- Enhance gluconeogenesis.
	- Inhibit peripheral glucose utilization.
	- Necessary for vascular and bronchial smooth muscle responsiveness to catecholamines.
	- Structurally similar to aldosterone, causing fluid retention, hypernatremia, and hypokalemia.
- **Regulation**:
	- Stimulated by ACTH, following a diurnal rhythm.
	- Stressful conditions increase ACTH and cortisol secretion.
	- Circulating glucocorticoids provide negative feedback to inhibit ACTH and cortisol secretion.

#### Catecholamines

- **Composition**:
	- Epinephrine constitutes 80% of adrenal catecholamines.
- **Regulation**:
	- Controlled by sympathetic cholinergic preganglionic fibers innervating the adrenal medulla.
- **Stimuli**:
	- Exercise, hemorrhage, surgery, hypotension, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, pain, and fear.
### Common Disorders of Adrenocortical Function

## Mineralcorticoid Excess

![](Pasted%20image%2020240312130619.png)

### Aldosterone Mechanism of Action

1. **Binding in Kidney Principal Cells**:
	
	- **Location**: Collecting duct.
	- **Effect**:
		- Increased Na⁺ and K⁺ channel insertion on the luminal surface.
		- Increased Na/K ATPase activity on the basolateral surface.
		- **Result**: Increased Na⁺ reabsorption and increased K⁺ excretion.
	- **Clinical Findings**:
		- Na⁺ follows its concentration gradient into the cell.
		- K⁺ moves into the collecting duct to maintain electroneutrality.
		- Increased effective arterial blood volume (EABV) leading to hypertension and mild hypernatremia.
		- Decreased renin ratio.
2. **Binding in Kidney Alpha Intercalated Cells**:
	
	- **Location**: Late distal tubule and collecting duct.
	- **Effect**:
		- Increased H⁺ ATPase and Na/H ATPase activity on the luminal surface.
		- **Result**: Increased H⁺ excretion.
	- **Clinical Findings**:
		- H⁺ loss permits HCO₃⁻ to move down the gradient, resulting in increased HCO₃⁻ reabsorption.
		- Metabolic alkalosis.

### Hyperaldosteronism

- **Primary Hyperaldosteronism**:
	
	- Hypersecretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex
	- Etiologies:
		- Unilateral adenoma (aldosteronoma or Conn syndrome)
		- Bilateral hyperplasia
		- Rarely, carcinoma of the adrenal gland
- **Secondary Hyperaldosteronism**:
	
	- Stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)
	- Associated conditions:
		- Congestive heart failure
		- Hepatic cirrhosis with ascites
		- Nephrotic syndrome
	- **Note**: Secondary hyperaldosteronism is associated with increased renin levels
### Clinical Findings

- **Hypertension**:
	- Due to increased Na⁺ reabsorption and increased EABV.
- **Mild Hypernatremia**:
	- Chronic EABV expansion resets hypothalamic ADH release, leading to decreased ADH production.
- **Hypokalemia**:
	- Due to increased K⁺ excretion.
- **Metabolic Alkalosis**:
	- Increased H⁺ excretion and increased HCO₃⁻ reabsorption.
- **Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus**:
	- Due to decreased urinary concentrating ability.
	- Results in polydipsia and polyuria.

#### Conn's Syndrome Considerations

- **Salient Features**:
	
	- Hypertension
	- Hypernatremia
	- Hypokalemia
	- Metabolic alkalosis
- **Cardiovascular Hemodynamics**:
	
	- Handling of the adrenal gland during surgery can cause cardiovascular instability
	- Management: Use of short-acting alpha blockers such as phentolamine (1 mg IV) to manage instability
- **Electrolyte Abnormalities**:
	
	- Avoid interventions that may worsen alkalosis
## Glucocorticoid Excess

### Hypercortisolemia (Cushing's Syndrome): Clinical Findings

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311160504.png)

#### Kidney and Vasculature

- **Excess cortisol** in renal tubules saturates the enzyme 11β-HSD2, which normally converts cortisol to cortisone.
- **Mechanism**:
	- Capacity to convert cortisol to cortisone is exceeded, mimicking aldosterone by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors.
	- **Effects**:
		- Increased Na⁺ reabsorption in cortical collecting ducts.
		- Water follows Na⁺, leading to expansion of blood volume.
		- Chronic effects result in hypertension.
		- Increased K⁺ excretion causes hypokalemia.

#### Liver and Peripheral Tissue

- **Mechanism**:
	- Cortisol increases gluconeogenesis in the liver and induces insulin resistance through unclear mechanisms.
	- **Result**: Hyperglycemia.

#### Reproductive System

- **Mechanism**:
	- Cortisol exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamus, reducing GnRH, LH, and FSH secretion.
	- **Result**: Decreased estrogen and testosterone production, leading to infertility, decreased libido, and irregular menses.

#### Adipose Tissue

- **Mechanism**:
	- Cortisol increases fat breakdown (lipolysis) but selectively spares central, facial, and dorsal fat.
	- Cortisol also increases appetite.
	- **Result**: Central obesity, moon face, and supraclavicular and dorsal fat pads.

#### Skin and Connective Tissue

- **Mechanism**:
	- Increased serum cortisol reduces fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis.
	- **Result**: Skin atrophy, easy bruising, purple striae, thin skin, visible veins, and poor wound healing.

#### Muscle

- **Mechanism**:
	- Increased proteolysis and decreased protein synthesis.
	- **Effects**:
		- Cardiac muscle: Cardiomyopathy and heart failure.
		- Skeletal muscle: Proximal muscle weakness, especially in the upper arms and thighs.

#### Immune System

- **Mechanism**:
	- Normal serum cortisol protects against inflammation, but excess cortisol reduces inflammation and impairs immunity.
	- **Result**: Increased susceptibility to infection.

#### Bone and Calcium Metabolism

- **Mechanism**:
	- Increased serum cortisol decreases intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption and renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption.
	- Reduced serum Ca²⁺ increases PTH secretion.
	- Increased osteoclast activity leads to bone resorption and osteoporosis.

### Anesthesia for Cushing's Syndrome
#### Antibiotics

- **Considerations**:
	- Patients are immunocompromised, requiring strict asepsis for all invasive procedures.

#### Fluid

- **Considerations**:
	- Patients often have fluid excess, hypernatremia, and hypokalemia.
	- Treatment: Use aldosterone antagonists like spironolactone.
#### Acid-Base and Electrolytes

- **Considerations**:
	- If adrenal tumor present, check for primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's disease).
	- Assess electrolytes, acid-base balance, and fluid status (risk of overload).

#### Airway Management

- **Considerations**:
	- Optimize position due to buffalo hump and increased neck circumference.
	- Risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and impaired respiratory function due to proximal myopathy.
	- Obesity and buffalo hump can create a difficult airway.

#### Positioning

- **Considerations**:
	- Atrophic skin is easily damaged; careful padding is necessary.
	- Protect eyes due to potential exophthalmos.
	- Difficult IV access may be encountered.

#### Systemic Effects

- **Considerations**:
	- Monitor for ischemic heart disease (ECG), diabetes mellitus (glucose control), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (rapid sequence induction).
#### Cardiovascular System

- **Considerations**:
	- Hypertension is common; consider arterial line monitoring.
	- Discontinue enalapril the day before surgery.
#### Blood Sugar

- **Considerations**:
	- Monitor for hyperglycemia throughout the procedure.
#### Pharmacologic Considerations

- **Perioperative steroid replacement**:
	- Stress dose and post-operative replacement are necessary.
	- Consider 100 mg hydrocortisone if adrenalectomy is planned.
- **Sensitivity to neuromuscular blockers**:
	- Due to possible muscle weakness, hypokalemia, and catecholamine effects.
- **Cancer considerations**:
	- Mass effect, metabolic derangements, metastases, and medications if primary Cushing's (adrenal adenoma).
#### Postoperative Care

- **Considerations**:
	- PACU/ICU monitoring.
	- OSA and muscle weakness can increase risk of respiratory depression postoperatively.

#### Associated Conditions

- **Considerations**:
	- Assess for other endocrine pathologies.
	- If adrenal tumor is present, consider Conn's disease and pheochromocytoma.
	- If pituitary cause, evaluate thyroid function, growth hormone, prolactin, etc.

### Cushing's Syndrome vs. Cushing's Disease

- **Cushing's Disease**: Caused by a pituitary adenoma resulting in overproduction of ACTH.
- **Cushing's Syndrome**: Overproduction of corticosteroids due to adrenal tumor, iatrogenic administration, or paraneoplastic syndrome.

## Glucocorticoid Deficiency

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311095910.png)

### Central Adrenal Insufficiency: Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

#### Pathogenesis

- **Causes**:
	- Abrupt removal of exogenous steroids leading to decreased corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion by the hypothalamus.
	- Hypothalamic or pituitary infiltration or destruction.
- **Result**:
	- Impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, resulting in decreased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the pituitary gland.

#### Clinical Findings

- **Pituitary Mass Effects**:
	- Vision changes
	- Headaches
	- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak
- **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) Secretion**:
	- Decreased ADH secretion if the mass extends to the pituitary stalk, causing diabetes insipidus.
- **Androgen Production**:
	- Decreased production in the zona reticularis.
- **Cortisol Production**:
	- Decreased production in the zona fasciculata.
	- **Note**: Aldosterone production is unaffected as it is controlled by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).
- **Decreased Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone (MSH)**:
	- Reduced melanin production.
- **Clinical Symptoms**:
	- Polyuria
	- Polydipsia
	- Nocturia
	- Decreased axillary and pubic hair
	- Decreased libido in women
	- Increased susceptibility to hypoglycemia
	- Hyponatremia
	- Malaise
	- Fatigue
	- Anorexia
	- Weight loss
	- Weakness
	- Hypopigmentation of the skin

### Causes of Adrenal Insufficiency

- **Primary Adrenal Insufficiency (Addison Disease)**:
	- Caused by the destruction of the adrenal gland, leading to combined mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency.
- **Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency**:
	- Caused by inadequate ACTH secretion by the pituitary gland.
	- Most commonly results from the prior administration of exogenous glucocorticoids.

### Clinical Features of Adrenal Insufficiency

- **Aldosterone Deficiency**:
	- Hyponatremia
	- Hypovolemia
	- Hypotension
	- Hyperkalemia
	- Metabolic acidosis
- **Cortisol Deficiency**:
	- Weakness
	- Fatigue
	- Hypoglycemia
	- Hypotension
	- Weight loss

#### Addisonian Crisis

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311094741.png)

##### Triggers

- **Steroid-dependent patients** who do not receive appropriate glucocorticoid doses during periods of stress (e.g., infection, trauma, surgery).
- **Infusions of etomidate**.

##### Presentation

- Fever
- Abdominal pain
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Hypovolemia that may progress to circulatory shock

##### Acute Management

1. **Immediate Hydrocortisone Administration**:
	- Hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously immediately, followed by 200 mg daily.
2. **Cautious Fluid Resuscitation**:
	- Administer fluids cautiously, as patients can be 2-3 liters fluid-depleted.
3. **Identification and Management of Precipitating Illness**:
	- Identify and treat any underlying causes, such as infections or trauma.
4. **Investigations**:
	- **Random serum cortisol**:
		- > 500 nmol/L excludes adrenal insufficiency (AI).
		- < 100 nmol/L confirms AI.
	- **Short Synacthen Test**.
5. **Continuation of High-Dose Hydrocortisone**:
	- Maintain high-dose hydrocortisone throughout the acute crisis, then gradually taper to oral administration.
### Perioperative Steroids Management

#### Steroid Replacement

- Patients with glucocorticoid deficiency must receive adequate steroid replacement therapy.
#### Perioperative Glucocorticoid Supplementation

- Patients who have received suppressive doses of steroids (equivalent to 5 mg of prednisone daily) for more than two weeks in the previous 12 months may not respond adequately to surgical stress and should receive perioperative glucocorticoid supplementation.
#### Normal and Stress-Induced Cortisol Secretion

- Adults typically secrete 20 mg of cortisol daily.
- This can increase to more than 300 mg under maximal stress conditions.
#### Perioperative Glucocorticoid Dosing

- **Standard High-Dose Regimen**:
	- Administer 100 mg of hydrocortisone intravenously every 8 hours starting on the morning of surgery.
- **Alternative Low-Dose Regimen**:
	- Administer 25 mg of hydrocortisone at the time of induction, followed by an infusion of 100 mg over the subsequent 24 hours.

## Catecholamine Excess

### Pheochromocytoma

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314151424.png)

### Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

#### Pathogenesis

- **Causes**:
	- Familial disorders (e.g., Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 [MEN2], Von Hippel-Lindau [VHL], Neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1], familial pheochromocytoma).
	- Sporadic DNA mutations due to mutagens, malignancy, or errors in DNA replication.
- **Result**:
	- Dysfunction of tumor suppressor/onco-proteins leads to uncontrolled chromaffin cell proliferation.

#### Clinical Findings

- **Imaging**:
	- Visible adrenal mass on CT scan.
- **Overproduction of Catecholamines**:
	- **Detectable Metanephrines** in plasma and urine.
	- **Symptoms**:
		- Headaches
		- Sustained or paroxysmal hypertension
		- Pallor
		- Tachycardia and palpitations
		- Diaphoresis
		- Panic, tremor, and anxiety
		- Hyperglycemia
		- Weight loss and fatigue
- **Complications**:
	- Potentially fatal events such as heart attack and stroke.

### Causes

- **Tumors**:
	- Paragangliomas (extra-adrenal) and pheochromocytomas (adrenal gland) consist of cells originating from the embryonic neural crest.
	- Vascular tumors of chromaffin tissue.
	- 10% to 15% are bilateral or extra-adrenal.
	- 10% are malignant.
	- Unsuspected cases have a high mortality rate, up to 50%.

### Diagnosis

- **Urine Testing**:
	- Markedly increased urinary excretion of vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), norepinephrine, and epinephrine.
	- Elevated urinary catecholamines and metanephrines.
- **Blood Testing**:
	- Fractionated plasma-free metanephrine levels may be superior to urinary studies.
- **Imaging**:
	- MRI to locate the tumor.

### Pathophysiology

#### Alpha 1 Receptors

- **Effects**:
	- Increases peripheral vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure.
	- Hypertension can cause intravascular volume depletion, kidney failure, and cerebral hemorrhage.
	- Elevated peripheral vascular resistance increases myocardial work, leading to myocardial ischemia, ventricular hypertrophy, and congestive heart failure.
	- Prolonged exposure to catecholamines may cause catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy.
	- Hyperglycemia results from decreased insulin secretion combined with increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

#### Beta 1 Receptors

- **Effects**:
	- Increases automaticity and ventricular ectopy.

#### Beta-Blockade Considerations

- If beta-receptors are blocked first, norepinephrine and epinephrine will produce unopposed alpha stimulation.
- Beta 2-mediated vasodilation will not offset alpha 1 vasoconstriction, increasing peripheral vascular resistance.
- This can explain paradoxical hypertension in patients treated only with labetalol.
- The myocardium might not cope with its elevated workload without the inotropic effects of beta 1 stimulation.

### Pharmacologic Management

#### Phenoxybenzamine

- **Mechanism**:
	- Alpha 1-antagonist that effectively reverses vasoconstriction.
	- Results in a drop in arterial blood pressure and an increase in intravascular volume (hematocrit drops).
	- Glucose intolerance often corrected.
	- Administered orally and is longer-acting than phentolamine.
	- Used preoperatively to control symptoms.

#### Phentolamine

- **Use**:
	- Intravenous alpha 1-antagonist used intraoperatively to control hypertensive episodes.

### Clinical Presentation

- **Symptoms**:
	- Paroxysmal hypertension
	- Headache
	- Sweating
	- Palpitations
- **Intraoperative Considerations**:
	- Unexpected hypertension and tachycardia during manipulation of abdominal structures.
### Conduct of Anaesthesia for Pheochromacytoma

[View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.](https://whimsical.com/conduct-of-anaesthesia-Y3YFaJJoWTjcmEQiUVHUtG?ref=chatgpt)

#### Preoperative Assessment

- **Focus**: Adequacy of α-adrenergic blockade and volume replacement.
- **Common Issues**: Most patients are hypovolemic (decreased plasma volume and red cell mass).
- **Vital Signs Monitoring**: Resting BP, orthostatic BP, heart rate, ventricular ectopy, and electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia.
- **Medication Management**:
	- **α-adrenergic Blockade**: Preoperative α-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine (a non-competitive inhibitor) helps correct volume deficit and hypertension.
	- **β Blockade**: Initiate only after adequate α blockade to control heart rate if necessary.
- **Preoperative Monitoring**: Patients may be admitted a few days prior to surgery for BP control observation or outpatient 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring.
- **BP and HR Goals**: Aim for BP <140/90 mmHg and heart rate <100 bpm.

#### Intraoperative Management

- **Monitoring**:
	- **Arterial Line**: Due to significant BP fluctuations during induction and tumor manipulation.
	- **CVP**: For monitoring vaso-active substances.
	- **TOE**: For volume assessment, stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO).
- **Intubation**: Blunt intubation response to minimize hemodynamic fluctuations.
- **Epidural Analgesia**: Consider for open procedures, but note it will not prevent catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction.
- **Hypertension Management**:
	- **Medications**: Phentolamine (selective alpha antagonist), nitroprusside, or nicardipine.
	- **Additional Agents**: Fentanyl, alfentanil, remifentanil until tumor removal, then morphine (10–20 mg). Nicardipine and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) are also useful.
	- **MgSO4 Protocol**: Bolus of 2–4 g prior to induction, then continued at 1–2 g/hr.
	- **Other Options**: Intermittent 2 g boluses of MgSO4, boluses of remifentanil, phentolamine, sodium nitroprusside, or labetalol (if associated with tachycardia).
	- **Heart Rate Control**: Maintain HR <100 bpm with the β-blocker of choice.
- **Avoid**:
	- **Indirect Acting Drugs**: Ephedrine, hypoventilation, large bolus doses of ketamine.
	- **Arrhythmic Drugs**: Halothane.
	- **Antihistamines**: Atracurium or morphine.
	- **Vagolytic Drugs**: Anticholinergics.
- **Hypotension Post-Tumor Ligation**: Use phenylephrine or noradrenaline for management due to hypovolemia, effects of alpha/beta blockade, and tolerance to increased concentrations of abruptly withdrawn endogenous catecholamines.

#### Postoperative Management

- **Adrenal Resection**: If both adrenals are resected, administer hydrocortisone 100 mg bolus in the operating theatre, then transition to a maintenance dose post-surgical stress.

#### Special Considerations for Pregnancy and Pheochromocytoma

- **Mortality**: 17%, higher with normal delivery, hence C-section is warranted.
- **Safe Medications**: Phenoxybenzamine and metoprolol.
- **Timing of Surgery**: If diagnosed before mid-trimester, resect at this stage.

#### Management of Unexpected Cases

- **Suspicion**: Unexplained pulmonary oedema, hypertension, or hypotension.
- **Immediate Actions**: Stop surgery if pheochromocytoma is suspected; attempt to remove or handle the tumor may result in death.
- **Acute Medications**: GTN (vasodilators) and IV fluids, even with pulmonary edema due to common hypovolemia and potential marked BP drop from vasodilation.

![](Pasted%20image%2020240516120131.png)

## Anesthetic Considerations in Patients with Obesity

### Pathophysiology Driving Anesthetic Management

#### Excess Body Fat in Mouth and Pharynx

- **↑ Mallampati score**
- **↑ Neck circumference**
- **↓ Muscle tone in pharynx and tongue post-neuromuscular blocking drugs**
	- **Result:** Airway obstruction
	- **Interventions:**
		- Intubate via endotracheal tube, avoid supraglottic airway device
		- Consider video laryngoscopy
		- Use head-elevated laryngoscopy positioning
		- Pre-oxygenate to ↑ oxygen reserve during intubation

#### Excess Body Fat on Chest Wall

- **↑ Load compressing chest wall**
	- **Result:** Obesity-related restrictive lung disease
	- **↑ Respiratory rate, ↓ functional residual capacity, ↓ time to desaturation, hypoventilation while supine**
	- **Interventions:**
		- Avoid supine positioning, consider reverse Trendelenburg
		- Lung-protective ventilation (↓ tidal volume, optimize oxygen levels, positive end expiratory pressure)

#### Excess Intra-abdominal Fat

- **↑ Abdominal pressure**
	- **Result:** ↑ Pressure on gastric contents, gastric aspiration risk
	- **Interventions:**
		- Pre-operative fasting, gastric ultrasound to assess volume
		- Rapid sequence induction to reduce aspiration risk

#### Excess Body Fat

- **↑ Fat acts as reservoir for lipophilic drugs, alters drug distribution and metabolism**
	- **Result:** Need for dosage adjustment
	- **Interventions:**
		- Adjust drug dosages based on individual recommendations

### Associations

- Type 2 DM, HT, CAD, OSA, degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis), and cholelithiasis
- Hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, delayed gastric emptying, hyperacidic gastric fluid, and gastric
- Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
- OSA leads to PHT and RHF
- Perioperative complications: hypertension, hypoxia, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, stroke, and death.

### Systemic Effects of Obesity

#### Airway

- Adipose deposition in upper airway, ↑ difficulty to bag mask ventilate, ↑ difficult intubation rate

#### Respiratory

- ↓ Compliance, FRC, ERV, and TLC
- ↑ Incidence of OSA and OHS, ↑ V/Q mismatch, rapid desaturation during apnea, pulmonary hypertension

#### Cardiovascular

- ↑ CO, hypertension, LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction
- ↑ IHD and CVA risk

#### Endocrine/Metabolic

- Diabetes mellitus, fatty liver disease, gastric reflux, dyslipidemia

#### Other

- ↑ Risk of venous thromboembolism, osteoarthritis
## Assessment

### STOP-BANG Criteria

- **S:** Snoring
- **T:** Tired
- **O:** Observed apnea
- **P:** Blood Pressure (high)
- **B:** BMI > 35 kg/m²
- **A:** Age > 50
- **N:** Neck circumference > 40 cm
- **G:** Gender (male)

### Risk Factors Requiring Further Evaluation

- Poor functional capacity
- Abnormal ECG
- Uncontrolled BP/IHD
- SpO₂ < 94% on air
- High bicarbonate
- Previous DVT/PE
- STOP-BANG > 5

## Classification

### Classification of BMI and Risk to Health

#### BMI (kg/m²)

- **Healthy:** 18.5–24.9
- **Overweight:** 25–29.9
- **Obesity 1:** 30–34.9
- **Obesity 2:** 35–39.9
- **Obesity 3:** ≥ 40

#### Waist Circumference Effect on Health

**Men:**

- Low: < 94 cm
- High: 94–102 cm
- Very High: > 102 cm

**Women:**

- Low: < 80 cm
- High: 80–88 cm
- Very High: > 88 cm

### Physiological Changes

- Increased O₂ demand and CO₂ production
- Increased alveolar ventilation (metabolic rate is proportional to body weight)
- Decreased compliance (chest wall). Normal lung compliance
- Decreased lung volumes and FRC (restrictive pattern)
- FRC below closing capacity resulting in V/Q mismatching
- Rapid desaturation and propensity for hypoxia

#### Cardiovascular Pathophysiology

- Predisposes the patient to heart failure, CAD, dysrhythmias, and hypertension
- Obesity paradox: More CV morbidity, but associated with improved CV outcomes

**Heart Failure:**

- Obesity cardiomyopathy:
	- Increased blood volume (in response to increased oxygen demand) 
	- Increased SVR (hyperinsulinemia = RAAS and adrenergic activation)
	- Increased left heart work = remodelling and dysfunction (diastolic then systolic dysfunction)

**Pulmonary Hypertension:**

- Same mechanism as above + OSA
- Right heart remodelling and dysfunction
- Check for symptoms, if unable, check BNP and Echo
- Patients with elevated preoperative natriuretic peptides (NT-proBNP ≥ 300 ng/L or BNP ≥ 92 mg/L) and patients with LVEF ≤ 40% (HFrEF) are at increased risk of perioperative complications and sudden cardiac death

**Hypertension:**

- Higher risk due to RAAS and adrenergic system activation

### Dosing of Drugs

**Total Body Weight:**

- Suxamethonium
- Propofol (infusion)

**Ideal Body Weight/Adjusted Body Weight:**

- NDMR (Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants)
- Paracetamol
- NSAIDs
- Local anesthetics
- Ketamine

**Lean Body Weight:**

- Thiopentone
- Propofol (induction dose)
- Opioids

## Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS)

### Formal Criteria for Diagnosis of OHS

- BMI over 30 kg/m²
- Arterial CO₂ level over 45 mmHg (6.0 kPa) on ABG
- No alternative explanation for hypoventilation (e.g., narcotics, severe obstructive or interstitial lung disease, severe chest wall disorders such as kyphoscoliosis, severe hypothyroidism, neuromuscular disease, or congenital central hypoventilation syndrome)
- Daytime hypoxia
- Chest wall mechanics associated with obesity

### Suspected OHS Management

**Screening with Serum Bicarbonate and Pulse Oximetry:**

- **High Risk:**
	
	- SpO₂ < 93%, Serum bicarbonate > 27 mEq/L → Arterial blood gas analysis
- **Low Risk:**
	
	- SpO₂ > 93%, Serum bicarbonate < 27 mEq/L

**Confirmed OHS:**

- Assess for pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction
- Avoid procedures during acute exacerbations or infections
- Start PAP immediately
- Prefer regional anesthesia
- Difficult airway care
- Use positive pressure postoperatively

### Relationship Between OSA and OHS

- 9-20% of OSA patients have OHS
- 90% of OHS patients have OSA

**Key Indicators:**

- PCO₂ ≥ 45 mmHg
- HCO₃ ≥ 28 mmol/L
- PO₂ ≤ 70 mmHg
- Sensitivity to opioids and risk of pulmonary hypertension

## Anaesthesia for Obesity

### Key Challenges

- **Apnoea Risk:** Avoid sedation.
- **Difficult Bag Mask Ventilation**
- **Difficult Intubation**
- **Difficult Regional Anaesthesia:** Requires 20% to 25% less local anesthetic per blocked segment.
- **Difficult IV Access:** Consider central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring.
- **Difficult Monitoring:** Use arterial line (A-line).
- **Difficult Positioning:** Risk for pressure sores and DVTs.
- **Difficult Operations:** Longer operating times.
- **Increased Risk for Sepsis**
- **Increased Risk for Aspiration**
- **Difficult Extubation:** Use CPAP.
- **Drug Dosing:** Dose water-soluble drugs to ideal body weight (IBW).

### Anesthetic Technique

#### Considerations

- **Premedication:** Antacid, analgesia, careful glucose control, DVT prophylaxis.
- **Positioning:** Self-position on the operating table, preoxygenate, and intubate in the ramped position.
- **Ventilation:** Tracheal intubation, avoid spontaneous ventilation, use PEEP.
- **Anesthetic Agents:** Use short-acting agents, PONV prophylaxis, ensure full neuromuscular blockade (NMB) reversal.
- **Extubation and Recovery:** In head-up position.

#### Suggested Equipment

- Suitable bed/trolley, gel padding, wide strapping, table extensions/arm boards.
- Forearm cuff or large BP cuff, ramping device, ventilator with PEEP.
- Hover mattress, long spinal/regional needles, ultrasound, depth of anesthesia, and neuromuscular monitoring.
- Sufficient staff for patient movement.

### Suggested Dosing for Anesthetic Drugs

#### Lean Body Weight (LBW)

- Propofol induction, thiopentone, fentanyl, alfentanil, morphine, non-depolarizing NMBDs, paracetamol, local anesthetics.

#### Adjusted Body Weight

- Propofol infusion, neostigmine, sugammadex, antibiotics.

#### Total Body Weight

- Succinylcholine, LMWHs (titrate with Xa levels).

### Analgesia

1. **Opioid Dosing:** Start with LBW and titrate to effect. Patients with OSA are more sensitive to opioids, requiring smaller doses and careful titration to avoid respiratory depressant effects.
2. **Multimodal Approach:** Use paracetamol and NSAIDs to reduce opioid requirements.
3. **Regional Anesthesia:** Recommended where surgery allows. Benefits include avoiding airway instrumentation and mechanical ventilation, providing good analgesia without opioids. Note higher failure rates.

# Carcinoid Syndrome

[Carcinoid syndrome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9PKk447Krg&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcardiothoracicanaesthesia.com%2F&source_ve_path=MzY4NDIsMjg2NjY)

## Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311153210.png)

## Definition

Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is the clinical spectrum produced by the release of amine and neuropeptide substances into systemic circulation by carcinoid cells. It results from the secretion of vasoactive substances (e.g., serotonin, kallikrein, histamine) from neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid tumors). Most tumors are gastrointestinal (GIT) tumors that release substances into the portal circulation, where they are metabolized by the liver before causing systemic effects. Non-intestinal tumors (e.g., pulmonary, ovarian) or hepatic metastases bypass the portal circulation and can cause a variety of clinical manifestations. Approximately 20% of patients with carcinoid tumors, usually with hepatic metastases, exhibit the syndrome. The malignancies implicated include neuroendocrine tumors in the GI tract (midgut) and bronchial tumors.

## Considerations

### Tumor-Related Issues

- **Mass effect:** Hemoptysis, bowel obstruction.
- **Metabolic derangements:** Flushing, diarrhea, hemodynamic instability, bronchospasm (serotonin-related).
- **Medications:** Octreotide.

### Metastases-Related Issues

- **Liver dysfunction**
- **Raised intracranial pressure (ICP)** if brain metastases are present.

### Cardiovascular Dysfunction (20-40%)

- **Right-sided valvular lesions:** 10% may present with left-sided lesions.
- **Right ventricular dysfunction**
- **Dysrhythmias:** e.g., supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).
- **Constrictive pericarditis**

### Perioperative Carcinoid Crisis Preparation and Treatment

- **Symptoms:** Flushing, diarrhea, hypotension, hyperglycemia, bronchospasm.
- Carcinoid tumors may also secrete growth hormone (GH) (leading to acromegaly) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (leading to Cushing's syndrome).

## Carcinoid Heart Disease and Serotonin Metabolism

### Pathophysiology and Clinical Manifestations

#### Right-sided Carcinoid Heart Disease

This is more common due to the inactivation of vasoactive substances by the lungs. It involves myofibroblast infiltration and activation of valvular interstitial cells, leading to fibrosis.

#### Left-sided Carcinoid Heart Disease

Caused by bronchopulmonary carcinoid, right-to-left intracardiac shunt, or high disease burden.

### Biochemical Pathway for Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine) Synthesis and Degradation

1. **Tryptophan** → 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) (via 5-hydroxylase)
2. **5-HTP** → 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) (via decarboxylase)
3. **5-HT** → 5-Hydroxyindole Acetaldehyde (via monoamine oxidase)
4. **5-Hydroxyindole Acetaldehyde** → 5-Hydroxyindole Acetic Acid (5-HIAA) (via aldehyde dehydrogenase)

### Mediators and Clinical Manifestations

- **Serotonin:** Causes vasoconstriction (coronary artery spasm, hypertension), increased intestinal tone, water and electrolyte imbalance (diarrhea), tryptophan deficiency (hypoproteinemia, pellagra).
- **Kallikrein:** Causes vasodilation (hypotension, flushing) and bronchoconstriction.
- **Histamine:** Causes vasodilation (hypotension, flushing), arrhythmias, and bronchoconstriction.

## Clinical Presentation

- Cutaneous flushing, bronchospasm, profuse diarrhea, dramatic swings in arterial blood pressure (usually hypotension), and supraventricular arrhythmias. The "Carcinoid triad" includes carcinoid heart disease, diarrhea, and flushing.
- Right-sided heart disease is caused by valvular and myocardial plaque formation, and, in some cases, tumor implantation on the tricuspid and pulmonary valves.

## Diagnosis

- Serotonin metabolites in the urine (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 5-HIAA) or plasma, or elevated plasma levels of chromogranin.

### Carcinoid Syndrome and Tumor Locations

#### Tumor Locations and Characteristics

- **Foregut:** Lungs, stomach, liver, biliary tract, pancreas, first portion of the duodenum. Clinical manifestations include atypical carcinoid, Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) syndrome, acromegaly, and Cushing's syndrome. Biochemical markers: 5-HTP, histamine, peptide.
- **Midgut:** Distal duodenum, small intestines, appendix, right colon, proximal transverse colon. Clinical manifestations include classic carcinoid syndrome. Biochemical markers: 5-HT, substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), kinins, peptides.
- **Hindgut:** Distal transverse colon, left colon, rectum. Typically silent clinical presentation with a non-secretory biochemical profile.

### Clinical Manifestations of Carcinoid Syndrome

- **Flushing** (85-90%): Long-lasting violaceous flushing of the face and neck (foregut carcinoid) or transient pink-red flushing (midgut carcinoid).
- **Gastrointestinal hypermotility** (70-80%): Watery, profuse diarrhea, often associated with nausea and vomiting.
- **Bronchospasm** (15%): Wheezing.
- **Abdominal pain** (35%): Progressive pain associated with small bowel obstruction and ischemia.
- **Right heart failure** (30%): Carcinoid heart disease.
- **Pellagra** (5%): Characterized by diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia due to niacin deficiency.
## Carcinoid Heart Disease (Hedinger Syndrome)

- Occurs in over 50% of patients with carcinoid syndrome and can be the initial presentation in up to 20% of patients.
- Typically affects the right side of the heart, causing fibrous thickening of the endocardium and retraction and fixation of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves.
- Pathogenesis may involve diet drugs (e.g., fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine) interfering with serotonin metabolism.
## Management

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311153126.png)

### Surgical and Symptomatic Treatment

- **Surgical resection:** For tumor removal.
- **Symptomatic relief:** Use of specific serotonin and histamine antagonists.
- **Somatostatin:** An inhibitory peptide that reduces the release of vasoactive tumor products.
- **A-line/CVP/TOE:** For monitoring during surgery.

## Prevention

- **Prophylaxis:** Octreotide 300-500 mcg IV.
- **Regional anesthesia:** May limit the stress response.
- **Consult endocrinologist:** To clarify the role of antihistamine, antiserotonin drugs (e.g., methysergide), octreotide (a long-acting somatostatin analogue), or antikallikrein drugs (e.g., corticosteroids) in specific patients.
- **Avoid triggers:** Such as tumor manipulation, hypovolemia, hypoxia, hypothermia, hypercarbia, histamine-releasing drugs, vasoactive drugs, and succinylcholine.

### Triggers Include

- Tumor manipulation
- Hypovolemia
- Hypoxia
- Hypothermia
- Hypercarbia
- Histamine-releasing drugs
- Vasoactive drugs
- Succinylcholine

## Management During Crisis

- **Octreotide:** 100 mcg IV boluses titrated to effect or an infusion.
- **H1 antagonists:** Diphenhydramine 25-50 mg IV.
- **Refractory hypotension:** Administer fluids and use octreotide, phenylephrine, or vasopressin. Avoid epinephrine, norepinephrine, and ephedrine.

### Treatment of Perioperative Bronchospasm

- **Avoid:** Beta agonists, theophylline, and epinephrine.
- **Use:** Octreotide, steroids, histamine blockade (diphenhydramine), and ipratropium bromide (Atrovent).

## Anesthesia for Carcinoid Syndrome
### Considerations

[View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.](https://whimsical.com/considerations-for-carcinoid-34FncRaoNJbP23pyBvyDE1?ref=chatgpt)

### Preoperative Management

- Optimize fluid, electrolytes, anemia, and malnutrition.
- **Cardiovascular assessment:** Echocardiogram (ECHO) or cardiac MRI.
- **Octreotide:** Various regimens.
- Consider benzodiazepine (BZD) premedication.
### Intraoperative Management

- **Neuraxial anesthesia:** Attenuates the stress response but must be weighed against the added hypotension if a crisis occurs.
- **Monitors:** Invasive blood pressure (IBP) and central venous pressure (CVP); low CVP reduces hepatic bleeding.
- **Smooth induction:** Consider remifentanil.
- **Avoid histamine releasers:** Atracurium, pancuronium, morphine.
- **Vasoconstrictors:** Variable response; sympathomimetics contraindicated. Use phenylephrine, vasopressin, or angiotensin.

### Postoperative Management

- ICU: Due to the ongoing risk of crisis from incomplete resection.
- Continue octreotide.
- Delayed emergence possible due to increased serotonin levels.
- Ensure good analgesia.

## Treatment with Octreotide

- **Prevention and treatment:** Mainstay for preventing and treating carcinoid crisis.
- **Administration:** Recommended to commence before surgery and continue throughout with supplemental dosing. Half-life is 60-90 minutes. Can be administered subcutaneously or intravenously.
- **Preoperative regimen:** 100 μg subcutaneously and another 100 μg intravenously before induction.
- **Intraoperative infusion:** 50-100 μg·h^-1, with a continuous infusion of 50 μg·h^-1 for 12 hours prior to surgery.
- **Potential side effects:** QT prolongation, bradycardia, conduction defects, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting.
# Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia

- Pancreas: Common tumors include gastrinomas and insulinomas.
- Pituitary gland
- Parathyroid glands

### MEN Type 2

MEN type 2 is subdivided into two main types: MEN 2a and MEN 2b (or MEN 3).

#### MEN Type 2a

- Medullary thyroid carcinoma
- Pheochromocytoma
- Hyperparathyroidism

#### MEN Type 2b (or MEN 3)

- Medullary thyroid carcinoma

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311094642.png)

## Anesthesia for Acromegaly

### Difficult Airway

- **Difficult Bag-Mask Ventilation (BMV):** Large face, macroglossia, enlarged epiglottis.
- **Difficult Laryngoscopy:** Macrognathia, macroglossia, enlarged epiglottis and tonsils, polypoidal masses in pharyngeal tissue.
- **Difficulty Passing Endotracheal Tube (ETT):** Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, impaired mobility of cricoarytenoid joints, vocal cord thickening, subglottic narrowing.
	- **Signs to watch for:** Stridor and dyspnea. If present, consider ENT assessment with nasendoscopy and awake fiberoptic intubation if there is glottic involvement.
	- **Thyroid enlargement (25%):** May compress the trachea.
- **Other considerations:** Risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), nasal turbinate hypertrophy causing difficulty passing nasal airways, skeletal changes leading to reduced neck mobility.
### Anaesthesia Techniques for Acromegaly

#### General Techniques

1. **Airway Management**
	
	- Macrognathia, macroglossia, hypertrophy of upper airway soft tissue, trachea, epiglottis, vocal cords.
	- Coarse facial features, protruding jaw, excessive bone hypertrophy may make bag-mask ventilation difficult.
	- Risk of airway obstruction.
	- Glottic and subglottic stenosis (laryngeal narrowing).
	- Hoarseness may indicate recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement.
	- **Preferred Techniques:** Optimum positioning, appropriate size Guedel airway, external laryngeal pressure, gum elastic bougie or airway exchange catheter, spontaneous respiration and "have a look" approach, awake tracheal intubation, possibly smaller diameter tube, backup LMA for failed intubation, backup equipment and personnel for surgical airway.
2. **Conduct of Anesthesia**
	
	- **Summary:** Oily skin (difficult ECG stickies), compromised ulnar flow in 1/3, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, risk of myocardial infarction, conduction defects, large lungs, kyphoscoliosis (20%), insulin resistance/diabetes mellitus, OSA, airway issues, muscle weakness (TO4 monitoring).
	- **Pre-op Assessment:** Cardiovascular (hypertension, LVH, cardiomyopathy, higher risk of MI, conduction defects/arrhythmias, exercise tolerance, echo if symptomatic), metabolic (glucose intolerance or diabetes), respiratory (enlarged lungs with increased VQ mismatch, ABG check, OSA risk), airway assessment.
	- **Positioning:** Long table, padding of vulnerable areas to prevent nerve compression.
	- **Monitors:** ECG electrodes may be difficult to secure due to oily skin and hyperhidrosis, arterial line considerations due to compromised blood flow, TO4 monitoring for muscle weakness.
	- **IV Access:** Lines may need to be sutured in place, thick skin.
	- **Blood Sugar Monitoring:** Associated with diabetes/impaired glucose tolerance.
	- **Ventilation:** Enlarged lung volumes requiring increased tidal volume.
	- **Regional Anesthesia:** Skeletal changes may complicate regional anesthesia, 20% have kyphoscoliosis.
	- **Post-op Care:** High care for OSA risk.
### Goals and Conflicts

- **Airway Management:** Secure difficult airway safely; consider awake fiberoptic intubation if stridor and voice changes are present.
- **Thorough Cardiopulmonary Examination:** Including volume status assessment.
- **Post-operative Considerations:** Avoid CPAP following trans-sphenoidal surgery, manage post-operative pain vs. enhanced sedation/respiratory depression.

### Crises Management

- **Post-operative Stridor:** Subglottic edema, vocal cord paralysis.
- **Endocrine Emergencies:** Diabetes insipidus, SIADH.

## Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings of GH Excess

### Pathogenesis

1. **Somatotroph Adenoma in Anterior Pituitary**
	- Leads to increased GH secretion in frequency and amplitude.
	- Can stimulate/repress other hormones.
		- Increased Prolactin
		- Decreased FSH/LH
2. **Microduplications in Chromosome Xq26.3**
	- Contributes to GH excess.
3. **GH Excess**
	- Results in acromegaly/gigantism.

### Acromegaly/Gigantism

- **Imaging Findings**
	- **Plain film:** Decreased joint spaces.
	- **CT/MRI:** Macroadenoma (>1cm).
- **Increased Intracranial Pressure**
	- **Symptoms:** Headache, decreased visual confrontation, decreased visual acuity, bitemporal hemianopsia.
- **Local IGF-1 Overproduction**
	- **Connective tissue overgrowth:** Acne, coarse features, hyperhidrosis, hypertrichosis, macrognathia, enlarged hands and feet.
- **Median Nerve Edema**
	- Leads to carpal tunnel syndrome.
- **Excess Insulin Secretion**
	- **Results in:** Decreased insulin receptor numbers and affinity causing acanthosis nigricans, impaired glucose tolerance, weight gain.
- **Cardiovascular Disease**
	- **Manifestations:** Cardiac arrhythmia, valvular damage, decreased ejection fraction, hypertension.

### Notes

- **Acromegaly vs. Gigantism:**
	- GH excess before growth plate fusion → Gigantism.
	- GH excess after growth plate fusion → Acromegaly.
- **Other rare causes:** GHRH hypothalamic tumors, ectopic secretion of GHRH by neuroendocrine tumors.
