![](Pasted%20image%2020240311155212.png)

## Pathophysiology of Decompensated Liver Cirrhosis

### Precipitants for Decompensation

- Progressive liver disease
- Hypotension
- Infections
- Hepatocellular carcinoma
- Portal vein thrombosis
### Pathway from Stable Compensated to Decompensated Liver Cirrhosis

1. **Stable Compensated Liver Cirrhosis** → **Decompensated Liver Cirrhosis**:
	- **Synthetic Dysfunction**:
		- Infection → Coagulopathy
	- **Immune Dysfunction**
	- **Reduced Toxin Removal**:
		- Jaundice
		- Hepatic Encephalopathy
	- **Cardiovascular Dysfunction**:
		- Hepatorenal Syndrome
	- **Portal Hypertension**:
		- Varices → Variceal Haemorrhage
		- Ascites
		- Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis
### Cardiovascular Complications in Liver Cirrhosis

#### Increased Levels of Vasodilating Substances

- Nitric Oxide
- Carbon Monoxide
- Prostacyclin
- Endocannabinoids
- Endothelium-derived Hyperpolarizing Factor
- Tumour Necrosis Factor-α
- Adrenomedullin
- Hydrogen Sulfide

#### Pathophysiological Pathway

1. **Liver Dysfunction/Portal Hypertension** →
	- **Increased Levels of Vasodilating Substances** →
		- Splanchnic Vasodilation
		- Systemic Vasodilation
	- **Bacterial Translocation and Inflammation** →
		- Increased Plasma Volume
		- Increased Cardiac Output

## Considerations

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311155256.png)

# Considerations for Anaesthesia in Patients with Liver Disease

## Airway

- Aspiration risk due to increased gastric volume
- Friable and edematous tissues
## Multiorgan Dysfunction

### Central Nervous System (CNS)

- Encephalopathy
### Cardiovascular

- Hyperdynamic circulation: increased cardiac output, decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR)
- Cardiomyopathy
- Portopulmonary hypertension
### Pulmonary

- Hypoxemia due to intrapulmonary arteriovenous (AV) shunting and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch
- Restrictive lung physiology caused by ascites and pleural effusions
### Genitourinary (GU)

- Hepatorenal syndrome
- Renal failure
### Gastrointestinal (GI)

- Upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding from varices and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)
### Hematology

- Coagulopathy: decreased platelets, decreased clotting factors, increased fibrinolysis
- Immunodeficiency
### Endocrine

- Hypoglycemia
- Hyponatremia
- Lactic acidosis
## Etiology and Associated Conditions

- Viral (e.g., hepatitis)
- Drugs (e.g., alcohol, acetaminophen)
- Autoimmune (e.g., α-1-antitrypsin deficiency)
- Hemochromatosis
## Altered Drug Pharmacology

- Increased volume of distribution
- Decreased hepatic clearance
- Decreased protein binding
## Altered Fluid Physiology

- Total body water excess (ascites) with intravascular volume depletion
- Low albumin state
## Surgical Considerations

- Reconsider elective surgery in very high-risk patients (Child-Pugh Class C or MELD > 20)
### Other Considerations

- Avoid triggers that could increase pulmonary artery pressures, such as hypoxia, hypercarbia, hypothermia, acidosis, and pain.
- Avoid calcium channel blockers, as they can worsen portal hypertension via mesenteric vasodilation.
- Consider using alternative pulmonary vasodilators, such as sildenafil.
## Monitoring

- Use invasive monitors for moderate to high-risk patients.
- Cardiac output monitoring may be utilized; while transesophageal echocardiography might cause variceal bleeding, substantial evidence for this is lacking.
## Vasoactive Agents

- Many vasopressors and inotropes can increase systemic pressure and cardiac output in chronic liver disease but have varying effects on hepato-splanchnic circulation.
- No conclusive studies exist on the optimal agent for maintaining regional mesenteric perfusion and microcirculation.
- Adrenaline and noradrenaline both decrease mesenteric flow and impair microcirculation in the jejunum, with adrenaline's effect being dose-dependent and more pronounced.
- Studies in septic shock patients comparing noradrenaline with dobutamine versus adrenaline only, showed better preservation of splanchnic circulation with dobutamine.
### Specific Vasopressors

- Phenylephrine can be used for arterial vasodilation.
- Caution with vasopressin in patients with intracranial hypertension, as it causes cerebral vasodilation.
## Pulmonary Complications

- Pleural effusion and hepatic hydrothorax
- Atelectasis and diaphragm displacement and wasting from massive ascites
- Aspiration pneumonitis, especially in hepatic encephalopathy
- Portopulmonary hypertension
- Hepatopulmonary syndrome
# Goals for Anaesthesia Management

- Identify and optimize multisystem complications
- Avoid elective or non-emergent surgery in acute liver dysfunction
- Pre-operative correction of coagulopathy and hypovolemia
- Consider draining ascites to optimize respiratory mechanics
- Anticipate fluid shifts and major blood loss
- Appropriate use of hepatically-metabolized drugs
- Universal precautions to prevent viral transmission
## Conflicts in Management

- Need for regional anesthesia versus coagulopathy
- High-risk patients versus elective surgery
- Pulmonary hypertension versus laparoscopy
# Ascites Management

## Pathogenesis

- Portal hypertension induces splanchnic vasodilation, stimulating ADH and renal sodium reabsorption, with abdominal lymph production exceeding resorption.
## Management

- Dietary salt restriction and diuretics (spironolactone or furosemide)
- V2 receptor antagonists (vaptans) have been tried but lack sufficient evidence for recommendation.
- Paracentesis for tense or refractory ascites:
	- Paracentesis-induced cardiovascular dysfunction can be avoided with concurrent vasopressors and 8g albumin IV per liter of ascitic fluid removed.
	- Ascites is associated with poor prognosis and high perioperative risk. Diuretic-resistant ascites may be managed with a trans-jugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt (TIPS).
## Anaesthetic Considerations

- Massive ascites can decrease venous return; hepatic hydrothorax and pleural effusions decrease pulmonary reserve; tense ascites may decrease gastric emptying and increase aspiration risk, necessitating rapid sequence induction.
# Management of Massive Variceal Bleed

## Overview

- Esophageal varices are present in up to 60% of patients at the time of cirrhosis diagnosis, with 30% experiencing bleeding. Mortality associated with the first bleed can be up to 50%.
- This is an emergency situation requiring emergent airway management with rapid sequence induction (RSI) and two suctions.
## Hemorrhage Management

- Administer blood products as indicated, reverse coagulopathy, and initiate the massive transfusion protocol.
## Pharmacologic Management

- Vasopressin: 0.4 unit bolus followed by infusion of 0.4 to 1 units/min
- Octreotide: 50 mcg bolus, then 50 mcg/hr infusion
## Other Interventions

- Balloon tamponade with a Blakemore (Minnesota) tube
- Endoscopic management of varices
- TIPS if endoscopic management fails

# Hepatic Encephalopathy

## Introduction

- Cerebral edema leading to intracranial hypertension complicates approximately 50-80% of patients with grade III or IV hepatic encephalopathy and is a leading cause of death.

## Pathogenesis

- **Ammonia-Glutamine Hypothesis (Cytotoxic Edema):**
	- Increased serum ammonia (>117 umol/L) leads to cerebral ammonia accumulation, although it does not directly correlate with symptom severity. Impaired metabolism of ammonia by the liver, kidneys, and muscles allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in astrocytes. Glutamine synthetase converts ammonia to glutamine, causing astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema. Cerebral glutamine concentration correlates with neuropsychiatric symptoms and intracranial hypertension.
- **Toxic-Liver Hypothesis (Vasogenic Edema):**
	- Severe acute liver failure results in the accumulation of toxins, CNS depressants, and inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10), inducing CNS injury. Loss of autoregulation leads to cerebral hyperemia and vasogenic edema in severely encephalopathic patients.
## Diagnosis

- Use the West Haven grading system for hepatic encephalopathy after excluding other causes of altered consciousness, confusion, or delirium.
### Diagnosis of Hepatic Encephalopathy

#### Clinical Grading (West Haven)

| Grade | Level of Consciousness / Cognitive Function | Psychiatric Symptoms | Neuromuscular Function                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Sleep disturbance, mild confusion           | Euphoria/depression  | Tremor, incoordination, asterixis                    |
| 2     | Moderate confusion, disorientation to time  | Irritability         | Asterixis, slurred speech, impaired handwriting      |
| 3     | Marked confusion, somnolence                | Anxiety or apathy    | Asterixis, ataxia, hyperactive reflexes              |
| 4     | Coma, non-command following                 | -                    | Coma, dilated pupils, loss of cranial nerve reflexes |

### Management of Hepatic Encephalopathy

#### Identify and Treat Reversible Triggers

- Gastrointestinal bleeding
- Hypokalemia
- Alkalemia
- Hypoglycemia
- Hypovolemia
- Infection
#### General Measures

- Early intubation in grade III or IV encephalopathy
- Modest hyperventilation (PaCO₂ 4.5-5 kPa) and adequate oxygenation (PaO₂ >10 kPa)
- 30° head-up position, optimize cerebral venous drainage, avoid excessive PEEP
- Avoid hyperthermia and hyperglycemia
- Adequate sedation (propofol preferred for minimal pharmacokinetic changes)
- Early recognition and treatment of seizure activity (EEG required)
- If intracranial hypertension is refractory:
	- Osmotherapy: Mannitol (1 g/kg iv q6h), Hypertonic saline (10%), Target Na: 145-155 mEq/L
	- Hypothermia: Core temp 32-34°C
#### Rescue Therapies for Transplant Candidates

- Haemodialfiltration to decrease serum ammonia and indomethacin
#### Lactulose Therapy

- Decreases colonic pH & mucosal absorption of glutamine
- Not recommended in acute liver failure (ALF)
#### Referral for Transplant in ALF

- Early identification and transfer after resuscitation
#### Modified King's College Criteria for Liver Transplantation in ALF

- **Paracetamol-Induced ALF**:
	- Either one of:
		- pH < 7.30
		- Lactate > 3.0 mmol/L after 12h or >3.5 mmol/L after 4h of appropriate resuscitation
	- Or, all of:
		- INR > 6.5 or PT > 100 s
		- Creatinine > 300 μmol/L
		- Grade 3 or 4 encephalopathy
- **Non-Paracetamol Induced ALF**:
	- INR > 6.5
	- Or, three or more of:
		- Age >40 years or <10 years
		- Bilirubin > 300 μmol/L
		- > 7 days between jaundice & encephalopathy
