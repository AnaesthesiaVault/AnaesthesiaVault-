# Urological Surgery

## Cystoscopy Procedures

### Cystoscopy
- Procedures: Cystoscopy, TURP, bladder neck incision, TURBT, ureteroscopy, stone removal, or stent insertion.
- Patient Demographics: Common in patients over 60 years old, often with a smoking history (COPD risk).
- Preoperative Review: Always review UCE/CMP/FBC.
- Bladder Cancer: Can cause slow bleeding.
- Flexible Cystoscopy: Usually performed under sedation and local anesthesia (LA); biopsies can be done in this manner.
- Rigid Cystoscopy: Requires general anesthesia (GA) due to scope diameter and use of irrigating solution for bladder distension and visualization.

### Anesthesia Considerations
- Spinal Anesthesia: Effective with sedation (e.g., 2 mg midazolam). Sensory supply to the urethra, prostate, bladder neck, and bladder mucosa is from S2 to S4. Pain from bladder distension is carried by T10–L2. A block to T10 is achieved with 2.5–3 mL of ‘heavy bupivacaine’ 0.5%.
- Pacemakers and Defibrillators: Permanent pacemakers are not usually problematic. Implantable defibrillators need to be switched off due to diathermy triggering.
- Penile Erection: Managed with small doses of ketamine due to inadequate anesthesia depth.
- Antibiotic Prophylaxis: Single dose of an agent with Gram-negative cover, e.g., Gentamicin 3 mg/kg.
- DVT Prophylaxis: Graduated compression stockings.

## Complications

### Perforation of the Bladder
- Recognition: Difficult, especially with spinal block masking abdominal pain.
- Classification:
  - Extraperitoneal: Maximal pain in the suprapubic region.
  - Intraperitoneal: Generalized abdominal pain, shoulder tip pain due to fluid tracking to the diaphragm, signs of peritonism.
- Management: Intraperitoneal perforations need fluid resuscitation and urgent surgery to prevent progressive shock.

### Bacteraemia
- Rapid response to IV fluids and appropriate antibiotics (e.g., gentamicin—single dose of 3–5 mg/kg, followed by cefuroxime 750–1500 mg 8-hourly) if diagnosed quickly.

### Bladder Spasms
- Diagnosis: Painful involuntary bladder contractions, common in patients without preoperative indwelling catheters. Failure of irrigation fluid to flow freely supports the diagnosis.
- Management: Analgesia and Buscopan.

### Obturator Spasm
- Cause: Stimulation of the obturator nerve by diathermy current, causing leg adduction and impairing surgical access, increasing bladder perforation risk.
- Management: Reduce diathermy current.

# TURP Syndrome

## Definition
- Fluid overload and hyponatraemia from absorption of large volumes of irrigation fluid via open venous sinuses.
- Less likely with bipolar resectoscopes and saline irrigation. Laser enucleation has virtually eliminated the risk.
- Higher risk in patients with poorly controlled heart failure and coexisting diseases such as coronary disease, acute kidney injury, and in the elderly.

## Irrigation Fluid Characteristics
- Non-conductive, non-haemolytic, neutral visual density. Commonly glycine 1.5% in water (hypotonic, osmolality 220 mmol/L).
- Glycine: Non-essential amino acid, inhibitory neurotransmitter. Glycine toxicity and its metabolite ammonia may contribute to CNS disturbances.
- Absorption Rate: Approximately 20 mL/min; 1-1.5 L total average, up to 5 L.

### Factors Affecting Absorption
- Infusion Pressure: Bag kept at 60–70 cm above the bladder, never >100 cm.
- CVP: More fluid absorbed if hypovolaemic or hypotensive.
- Surgery Duration: Risk increases with procedures >1 hour.
- Prostate Size: Prostates >50 g.
- Blood Loss: Large blood loss indicates many open veins.

### Fluid Type Considerations
- Saline: Used in bipolar resections. Risk of fluid overload and hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis.

## Presentation and Diagnosis
- Symptoms: Pulmonary oedema, cerebral oedema, hyponatraemia, restlessness, headache, tachypnoea, respiratory distress, hypoxia, pulmonary oedema, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, confusion, convulsions, coma.
- In Anesthetized Patients: Tachycardia, hypertension, reflex bradycardia from large volume absorption, hypotension. Confirm diagnosis with low serum Na+ (<120 mmol/L symptomatic), checked via ABG.
- Solute Toxicity: Hyperglycinemia, hyperammonemia, hyperglycemia, intravascular volume expansion.

## General Management
- Limit intra-operative volume.
- Change irrigation fluid to saline in recovery to prevent further hypotonic glycine absorption.
- If suspected intraoperatively: Coagulate bleeding points, terminate surgery, stop IV fluids, administer Lasix 40 mg, check ABG (HB and Na), ABC.

### Severe Acute Hyponatraemia
- Management: Hypertonic saline (NaCl 1.8–3%) to restore Na+ to around 125 mmol/L.
- Calculation: Volume of 3% saline to raise serum Na+ by 1 mmol/L is twice the TBW (in L).
- Example: For a 70 kg man, TBW = 70 × 0.6 = 42 L. Therefore, 84 mL of 3% saline will raise serum Na by 1 mmol/L. Give 1.2–2.4 mL/kg/hr until symptomatic improvement.
- Correction Rate: 1.5–2 mmol/L/hr for 3–4 hours, then 1 mmol/L/hr until symptomatic improvement or Na+ >125 mmol/L. Maximum rise should not exceed 12 mmol/L in 24 hours.

## Complications of TURP
- TURP Syndrome: ~2%.
- Fluid Overload/Pulmonary Edema: Electrolyte abnormalities, dysrhythmias, hyperglycinemia (blindness), hyperammonemia (encephalopathy), hypothermia.
- Concealed Hemorrhage: Bladder perforation (~1%), septicemia (usually gram-negative), DIC (rare, associated with prostate cancer).
- Positioning: Lithotomy with nerve injury; hemodynamic and respiratory effects of Trendelenberg position.

### Common Complications
- Clot Retention
- Failure to Void
- Uncontrolled Acute Hematuria
- Urinary Tract Infection
- Chronic Hematuria

### Less Common Complications
- TURP Syndrome
- Bladder Perforation
- Hypothermia
- Sepsis
- Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation
