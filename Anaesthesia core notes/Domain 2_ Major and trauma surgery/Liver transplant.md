	- hepatologist, • transplant surgeon, • anaesthetist, • intensive care physician, • transplant co-ordinator, • other health and social care professionals as required, e.g. psychologist, social worker, dietitian, or substance misuse specialist
### Screening Investigations

#### Blood Tests

- Full blood count, PT, APTT, fibrinogen level
- Urea, creatinine, serum electrolytes
- Liver function test (LFT)

#### Respiratory Evaluation

- Chest X-ray (CXR)
- Spirometry

#### Cardiac Evaluation

- 12-lead ECG
- Echocardiography
- Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)

### Hepatorenal Syndrome

#### Management Options

**1. Vasoconstrictors**

- **Telipressin (Vasopressin Analogue) + Albumin**
- **Noradrenaline + Albumin**
- **Combination Therapy:** Midodrine, Octreotide, and Albumin
- **Vasopressin + Albumin**

**2. Albumin**

- Should be administered with any vasoconstrictor.

**3. Other Treatments**

- **Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)**
- **Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunting (TIPS)**
- **Experimental Treatments**

**4. Liver Transplant**

### Post-Operative Treatment Algorithm for Severe Post-Transplant Hypoxemia

1. **Severe Post-Transplant Hypoxemia**
2. **Trendelenburg Positioning** (If unsuccessful)
3. **Inhaled Epoprostenol or Inhaled Nitric Oxide**
	- If successful: Continue therapy
	- If unsuccessful: Administer intravenous methylene blue
4. **Intravenous Methylene Blue**
	- If successful: Continue therapy
	- If unsuccessful: Consider ECMO and/or Pulmonary Artery Embolization
## Post Operative

#### Early

1. Bleeding
2. Primary allograft dysfunction
3. Primary allograft non-function
4. Thrombosis of portal vein
5. IVC and hepatic vein thrombosis
6. Biliary tree obstruction
7. Hepatic artery thrombosis
8. Acute kidney injury
9. Sepsis
10. Cardiovascular events

#### Late

1. Immunosuppressant-related side effects
2. Infection
3. Graft rejection
4. Recurrent primary disease
5. Biliary tree obstruction
# Donor Considerations

1. **Patient Selection:**
	
	- Donors should be fit and healthy (ASA I - II). Confirm fitness pre-operatively.
2. **Monitoring:**
	
	- Use an arterial line (A-line).
	- Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring.
	- Large bore peripheral line.
3. **Anaesthetic Technique:**
	
	- Standard general anaesthesia (GA).
	- Cisatracurium is not mandatory; rocuronium with or without sugammadex can be used.
4. **Analgesia:**
	
	- Epidural analgesia and/or rectus sheath catheter for midline incisions.
5. **Fluid Management:**
	
	- Restrict fluids until after the hepatectomy to reduce bleeding (maintain CVP at 4-5 mmHg).

# Acute Liver Failure Management

1. **Cardiovascular System (CVS):**
	
	- Profound vasodilation and circulatory collapse may occur.
	- Volume replacement guided by cardiac output (CO) monitoring and the use of vasopressors as needed.
2. **Coagulation:**
	
	- Check prothrombin time (PT) every 12 hours.
	- Do not correct PT routinely; correct only if there is acute hemorrhage or before invasive procedures.
3. **Renal Function:**
	
	- Use renal replacement therapy (RRT) for oliguric/anuric renal failure.
	- Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) with lactate-free dialysate is preferred.
4. **Infection Control:**
	
	- Routine infection screening.
	- Administer antibiotics only for Grade 3-4 encephalopathy.
5. **Glycaemic Control:**
	
	- Patients are prone to hypoglycemia.
	- Monitor blood glucose every 2 hours and correct as needed.
	- Initiate early enteral nutrition.
6. **Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Management:**
	
	- Consider ICP monitoring for Grade 3 or 4 encephalopathy.
	- Maintain ICP < 20 mmHg.
7. **Specific Therapies:**
	
	- Consider N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for all patients with acute liver failure (ALF).
	- Administer antivirals for acute hepatitis B.
8. **Liver Replacement Therapies:**
	
	- Use Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) or Prometheus as a bridge to transplantation.

# Anaesthetic Concerns in Recipients of Liver Transplants Presenting for Non-Transplant Surgery

1. **Paracetamol:**
	
	- Safe to use.
2. **Hepatitis Recurrence:**
	
	- Monitor for recurrence of hepatitis.
3. **Reversal of Pre-Transplant Issues:**
	
	- **Early Post-Transplant (Days to Weeks):**
		- Portal hypertension, ascites, pleural effusions.
	- **Intermediate Post-Transplant (Weeks to Months):**
		- Encephalopathy, pulmonary hypertension (PHT), hepatopulmonary syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome.
		- Risk of prolonged emergence from anesthesia due to hypoalbuminemia and any residual encephalopathy.
	- **Long-Term Considerations:**
		- Post-transplant hypertension (due to steroids and cyclosporine), increasing the risk of cardiac events.
		- Hepatopulmonary syndrome may persist; pulmonary hypertension may take months to improve.
		- Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy can cause heart failure post-transplant.
		- Renal failure can be secondary to liver disease or immunosuppression.
		- Metabolic issues such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and non-alcoholic liver disease may arise.
