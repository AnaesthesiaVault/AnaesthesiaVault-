# Advantages of Regional Anaesthesia versus General Anaesthesia

- Reduction of nausea and vomiting
- A decreased stress response
- Excellent quality of analgesia both perioperatively and postoperatively, avoiding the systemic side effects associated with other analgesics
- Possible pre-emptive analgesia and, theoretically, a reduction in sensitization of nerve endings after surgery with a reduction in chronic pain syndromes
- Earlier patient discharge owing to improved analgesia and earlier mobilization
- Reduction of blood loss because of relative hypotension with central neural blockade
- Economic benefit to the hospital, as drug and equipment costs are consistently lower for regional anaesthesia and patients have shorter in-hospital stay
- Enhanced communication and easier positioning of the patient, who will be conscious throughout the surgery
- Avoidance of airway instrumentation and cervical movement during the operation, which is particularly important for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis
- Reduced environmental exposure to anaesthetic gases

## Why Ultrasound

- For adequately imaged nerves, a positive motor response to nerve stimulation does not improve the success of the block. A block could be successful without positive nerve stimulation. Muscle stimulation and paraesthesia may not occur even when ultrasound confirms the correct needle position. The needle can be intraneural and there can still be failure to provoke muscle contractions by the nerve stimulator.
- In diabetic patients, nerve stimulation and paraesthesia may be impossible to elicit at currents below 2.4 mA. Contrary to conventional belief, nerve puncture and intraneural injection of LA does not always lead to nerve injury.

## Contra-indications to Regional Anaesthesia

- Patientâ€™s refusal despite adequate explanation
- Confused, uncooperative or uncommunicative patient
- Systemic infection, trauma/burns/local infection over the site of injection
- Pre-existing neurological deficit (relative)
- Raised intracranial pressure (central neural blocks)
- Untreated hypovolaemia, hypotension or heart failure (central neural blocks)
- Anticoagulated/coagulopathic patient

# Upper Limb

## Upper Limb Blocks

- The upper extremity is well suited to peripheral nerve blockade because the entire arm and shoulder are innervated by the brachial plexus and blockade is easily accomplished with a single injection.
- The selection of regional technique will be dependent on the anticipated site of surgery as well as the site of the tourniquet. The interscalene approach is well suited for proximal surgery on the shoulder joint and upper arm; the supraclavicular approach is preferable for the upper arm, elbow, and radial side of the forearm and can provide a dense block of the arm providing optimal tourniquet coverage as well; the infraclavicular and axillary approaches are best for the hand, wrist, and forearm.

### Dermatomes

- **Occipital:** C2
- **Supraclavicular:** C3-C5
- **Suprascapular:** C5-C6
- **Subclavius:** C5-C6
- **Long thoracic:** C5-C7
- **Subscapular:** C5-C6
- **Axillary:** C5-C6
- **Intercostal:** T3-T12
- **Primary nerve branches**
- **Intercostobrachial:** T2
- **Cutaneous brachii medialis:** C8-T1
- **Musculocutaneous:** C5-C6
- **Median:** C5-T1
- **Ulnar:** C8-T1
- **Radial:** C5-T1
- **Cutaneous antebrachii medialis:** C8-T1

## Innervation

- Five major terminal nerves come from the plexus (axillary, musculocutaneous, median, ulnar, and radial) and these can be blocked individually or in combination to provide analgesia.
- The interscalene approach is well suited for proximal surgery on the shoulder joint and upper arm; the supraclavicular approach is preferable for the upper arm, elbow, and radial side of the forearm and can provide a dense block of the arm providing optimal tourniquet coverage as well; the infraclavicular and axillary approaches are best for the hand, wrist, and forearm.
- A major advance is the placement of indwelling brachial plexus catheters to provide prolonged analgesia at home, thereby allowing operations that would have traditionally required 2-3 days of hospitalization to be performed as day-stay or short-stay surgery.
### Brachial Plexus

![](Pasted%20image%2020240627083020.png)

The brachial plexus is formed by the anterior primary rami of the lower four cervical nerve roots (C5-C8) and the first thoracic nerve root (T1). It supplies sensory and motor innervation to the entire upper limb except for the trapezius muscle (innervated by the spinal accessory nerve) and the cutaneous innervation of the axilla (supplied by the intercostobrachial nerve).

## Structure of the Brachial Plexus

### Roots
- The ventral rami of C5-T1 spinal nerves form the five roots of the plexus.
- An interscalene block mainly targets the upper roots (C5-C7). Due to the vertical arrangement of the brachial plexus roots in the interscalene groove, C8 and T1 are often missed, hence the ulnar nerve may not be blocked.

### Trunks
- Shortly after leaving the intervertebral foramina, the roots unify to form three trunks:
  - Upper (C5-C6)
  - Middle (C7)
  - Lower (C8-T1)
- Supraclavicular blocks are performed at the level of the brachial plexus trunks to more reliably block the entire upper limb.

### Divisions
- Each trunk divides into two divisions, forming six divisions in total (three anterior and three posterior).
- The divisions generally cannot be blocked reliably because they lie behind the clavicle.

### Cords
- The six divisions unite again to form three cords:
  - Posterior cord (C5-T1) formed by the posterior divisions.
  - Lateral cord (C5-C7) formed by the anterior divisions from the upper and middle trunks.
  - Medial cord (C8-T1) formed by the anterior division of the lower trunk.
- The brachial plexus cords are named according to their relation to the axillary artery.
- Infraclavicular blocks are performed at the level of the cords and can achieve anaesthesia of the entire arm.

### Terminal Branches
- Mixed nerves containing sensory and motor nerve fibres.
  - **Ulnar nerve (C8, T1):** Arises from the medial cord. Provides motor innervation to the intrinsic muscles of the hand and sensation to the medial one and a half fingers.
  - **Musculocutaneous nerve (C5, C6, C7):** Derived from the lateral cord. Provides motor innervation to the flexor muscles (coracobrachialis, biceps brachii, brachialis) and sensory innervation to the lateral surface of the forearm. Continues as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm.
  - **Median nerve (C5-T1):** Arises from both the medial and lateral cords. Provides motor innervation to most flexor muscles in the forearm and thenar muscles of the thumb. Provides cutaneous innervation to the thumb, index finger, middle finger, lateral half of the ring finger, and nail beds of these fingers.
  - **Radial nerve (C5-T1):** The largest branch of the brachial plexus, derived from the posterior cord. Provides motor innervation to the extensor muscles of the elbow, wrist, and fingers, and sensation to the dorsum of the hand. Continues as the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm.
  - **Axillary nerve (C5-C6):** Arises from the posterior cord. Supplies the deltoid and teres minor muscles and provides sensation below the shoulder. Continues as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm.
- Axillary blocks are performed at the level of the terminal branches and depend on the relationship of nerves to the axillary vessels.

### Supraclavicular Branches
- Derived from the brachial plexus but provide innervation above the clavicle.
  - **Long thoracic nerve (C5, C6, C7):** Supplies the serratus anterior muscle.
  - **Dorsal scapular nerve (C5):** Supplies the rhomboid muscles and levator scapulae muscle.
  - **Nerve to the subclavius (C5, C6):** Supplies the subclavius muscle.
  - **Suprascapular nerve (C4, C5, C6):** Supplies the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles.

## Branches of the Cords of the Brachial Plexus

### Posterior Cord Branches (ULTRA)
- Upper subscapular
- Lower subscapular
- Thoracodorsal
- Radial
- Axillary

### Lateral Cord Branches (LLM)
- Lateral pectoral
- Lateral root of the median nerve
- Musculocutaneous

### Medial Cord Branches (MMMUM)
- Medial pectoral
- Medial cutaneous nerve of the arm
- Medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm
- Ulnar
- Medial root of the median nerve

## Shoulder Blocks
- A block of at least the upper two roots (C5 and C6) or the superior trunk of the brachial plexus is necessary.
- Blockade of the supraclavicular nerve is also needed, covering the 'cape' of the shoulder.
- The interscalene approach is best suited for shoulder joint and upper arm surgery, targeting the roots as they exit between the middle and anterior scalene muscles at the C6 level (identified by the cricoid cartilage).
- Complications can include blockade of the cervical sympathetic chain, recurrent laryngeal nerve, phrenic nerve blockade, hypotension, bradycardia, accidental epidural and spinal injection, and permanent spinal cord damage.
- Catheter placement into the brachial plexus allows continuous local anaesthetic infiltration for painful procedures like shoulder arthroplasties, facilitating earlier mobilization. However, this technique does not provide superior postoperative analgesia compared to infusion through an intra-articular catheter.
- For shoulder arthroscopy, a suprascapular nerve block can be used but should be combined with general anaesthesia for adequate analgesia.

## Elbow Blocks
- Surgery on the elbow may be performed with an interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary brachial plexus block or a mid-humeral block with cutaneous infiltration of the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm.
- An axillary approach may not be adequate for midor distal humerus surgery due to the close proximity of the level of blockade to the site of surgery and difficulty in blocking the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.

## Hand and Forearm Blocks
- Axillary blocks are ideal for hand and forearm surgery as the four main nerves (median, ulnar, radial, musculocutaneous) can be selectively identified using ultrasound guidance and/or peripheral nerve stimulation.
- Multiple-stimulation techniques are associated with a greater success rate than single injection techniques.
- This technique is most commonly used for surgery below the shoulder, providing effective analgesia for tourniquets applied to the upper arm. Peripheral nerve blocks at the elbow, wrist, and hand may be performed individually or in combination to provide discrete, distal nerve blockade or to supplement brachial plexus blocks.
- A short-duration brachial plexus block combined with a long-lasting peripheral nerve block allows early mobilization and limb protection while maintaining good peripheral analgesia.

## Bier's Block (IVRA)

### Preparation
- Standard preoperative fasting intervals should be observed.
- Informed patient consent.
- Standard minimum monitoring (electrocardiograph, noninvasive blood pressure, and SpO2).
- Resuscitation equipment available.
- Patient on a tilting trolley with suction available.
- Double-cuffed tourniquet system available and checked.

### Procedure
- Intravenous access in both limbs.
- Double-cuffed tourniquet on operative limb.
- Exsanguinate limb using elevation and digital arterial pressure.
- Inflate proximal tourniquet cuff to 250-300 mmHg and confirm.
- Slowly inject 0.5% prilocaine 40 ml.
- Once anaesthesia is established, inflate the distal cuff to the same pressure.
- Deflate the proximal cuff after confirming the distal cuff is inflated.
- Surgical procedure can proceed.
- Do not deflate the tourniquet until a minimum of 30 minutes has elapsed.
- Observe patient for signs or symptoms of local anaesthetic toxicity.

### Advantages
- Technical simplicity.
- Rapid onset and offset.
- Reliable if carried out correctly.
- Regional anaesthesia for short and simple distal limb procedures.

### Disadvantages
- Unsuitable for major surgery.
- Tourniquet pain.
- Maximum duration of about 90 minutes.
- Bloodless field not possible.
- Potential for local anaesthetic toxicity.
- No effective postoperative analgesia.

## Hip Surgery

- **Lumbar paravertebral or lumbar plexus block**: Used when spinal or epidural anesthesia is contraindicated. It can provide complete analgesia of the lower limb when combined with a sciatic nerve block, especially useful in revision joint replacement where the surgery is likely to be prolonged.
- **Femoral nerve block**: Provides analgesia for fracture neck of femur, total hip replacement, and femoral shaft fracture.
- **Three-in-one block**: Targets the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, obturator nerve, and femoral nerve by injecting a large volume of local anesthetic within the neurovascular sheath, though its effectiveness can be inconsistent.
- **Fascia iliaca block**: A hybrid anterior lumbar plexus approach providing faster and more consistent blockade of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh and femoral nerve than the â€˜three-in-oneâ€™ block.

## Knee Surgery

- **Femoral and sciatic nerve blocks**: Provide intraoperative and postoperative analgesia for knee joint surgery, improve early rehabilitation by effectively controlling pain compared to intravenous morphine via patient-controlled analgesia.
- **Psoas compartment block**: Provides anaesthesia and analgesia to the entire lumbar plexus, used for knee arthroscopy, though not commonly justified in ambulatory patients due to risks like epidural spread and weak hip flexors.
- **Femoral nerve block**: Covers the anteromedial thigh, anterior knee, and medial calf, making it one of the most common lower extremity blocks.
- **Intra-articular injection**: A combination of ropivacaine or levobupivacaine, adrenaline, morphine, and methylprednisolone, used increasingly for total knee replacement and sometimes for total hip replacement, though further studies are needed to determine the optimal volume and concentration of the drugs. An indwelling catheter can also be used for top-ups or continuous infusion, with a risk of infection.

## Ankle/Foot Surgery

- **Popliteal block**: Effective for foot and ankle surgery, often combined with a saphenous nerve block for medial foot and ankle involvement. Adequate for a calf tourniquet in conscious patients.
- **Sciatic and femoral nerve block**: Used if a thigh tourniquet is required during surgery, providing good surgical anesthesia and long-lasting postoperative pain control.
- **Popliteal sciatic nerve block combined with saphenous or femoral nerve block**: Allows use of a calf tourniquet and provides anesthesia comparable with neuraxial techniques, without urinary retention and with longer postoperative analgesia (12-24 hours with long-acting local anesthetics like ropivacaine or bupivacaine).
- **Ankle block**: Has minimal impact on postoperative ambulation while providing prolonged postoperative analgesia with long-acting local anesthetics. Ideal for avoiding foot drop, hamstring, or quadriceps weakness.
# Summary of All Blocks

## Suggested Standard Monitoring for Nerve Blocks

### Ultrasound + Nerve Stimulation + Opening Injection Pressure (OIP)

1. Connect needle to nerve stimulator (0.5mA, 0.1msec, 2Hz)
2. Advance needle towards the nerve or plexus
	- Needle adequately placed as seen on US
		- No twitch
		- 1-2 mL injection of LA results in adequate spread in the desired tissue plane OIP normal <15psi
	- Needle adequately placed as seen on US
		- Twitch present
		- Reposition the needle to assure NO twitch present at <0.5mA
			- 1-2 mL injection of LA results in adequate spread in the desired tissue plane OIP normal <15psi
3. Complete injection

- Increase current to 1.5mA
- Adjust needle placement by US
### Legend
- OIP normal (<15 psi): Based on data in both animal models and clinical trials where injection pressure required to inject local anesthetic for nerve or perineural exercise is <15 psi

# Regional Anaesthesia in Patients on Anticoagulation

## Comparison Between the ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Pain Guidelines

### General Recommendations
- All previous ASRA guidelines, including the current fourth edition, do not recommend discontinuation of aspirin or NSAIDs prior to the placement of epidural and spinal blocks.
- The guidelines do not differentiate between interventional pain procedures and perioperative regional anesthesia blocks, needle/catheter trauma, degree of anticoagulation, and ability to compress the site.
- ASRA guidelines may be appropriate for lowor intermediate-risk categories, but high-risk spine procedures require a more conservative approach.

### Aspirin and NSAIDs Management
- Aspirin and NSAIDs may be continued for low-risk pain procedures.
- For mediumand high-risk procedures, antiplatelet therapy is discontinued.
  - **Discontinuation Length for Aspirin**:
	- **Primary Prevention (no overt cardiovascular disease)**: 6 days
	- **Secondary Prophylaxis**: 4 days
  - **Discontinuation Length for NSAIDs**:
	- **1 to 2 days**: Ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketorolac, indomethacin
	- **4 days**: Naproxen, meloxicam
	- **6 days**: Nabumetone
	- **10 days**: Oxaprozin, piroxicam
- Aspirin and NSAIDs can be resumed a day after the procedure.

### Potent Antiplatelet Agents
- There is no significant difference between the guidelines in managing more potent antiplatelet agents, including clopidogrel, ticlopidine, ticagrelor, and prasugrel.

### Heparin Management
- Regional guidelines allow neuraxial injections in patients receiving SC BID heparin.
- Pain guidelines prefer that moderateand high-risk procedures not be performed.
  - If an interventional procedure is indicated, an interval of 6 hours (rather than 4-6 hours) should be followed.

### Timing Intervals for Neuraxial Injection
- Regional anesthesia guidelines recommend a 4to 6-hour interval between administration of the drug and neuraxial injection.
- Pain guidelines recommend an interval of 6 hours.

### LMWH, Warfarin, Thrombolytic Therapy, and Fondaparinux
- The guidelines on LMWH, warfarin, thrombolytic therapy, and fondaparinux are the same for both regional anesthesia/acute pain and interventional pain patients.
## Procedural Anticoagulation Management Checklist

### Evaluate Baseline Patient-Specific Risk Factors for Perioperative Bleeding
- History and physical examination signs suggestive of a bleeding disorder:
  - History of unexplained nosebleeds (epistaxis) or menorrhagia
  - Examination signs including petechiae, mucosal bleeding, purpura, or ecchymoses
- Family history of bleeding disorders.
- Screen for antiplatelet, antithrombotic, or thrombolytic therapy.
- Screen for SNRIs, SSRIs, and herbal therapies that may influence coagulation status.
- Order coagulation tests when needed based on history and physical examination and/or medication use.
- Identify aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs utilization.

### For Individuals on Aspirin Categorize Reason for Utilization
- Primary prophylaxis â†’ absence of established cardiovascular disease or risk factor.
- Secondary prophylaxis â†’ presence of cardiovascular disease.

### Process the Anatomical Location of Procedural Intervention into Decision-Making
- Intracanal vs extracanal spinal procedures
- Cervicothoracic neuraxial area or lumbosacral neuraxial area.
- Surrounding vascular structures at risk for penetration.

### Review Appropriate Radiographic Imaging to Identify and Understand Anatomic Challenges
- Cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal stenosis that alter spinal canal anatomy
- Epidural fibrosis and significant scar tissue from previous surgical intervention

### Identify and Manage Pharmacologic Coagulopathies
- Understand drug elimination and appropriate discontinuation time.
- Determine appropriate timing for reinitiation of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy.
- Practice informed decision-making involving procedural physician, prescribing medical physician, and patient.

### Employ Post-Procedure Surveillance for the Detection of Bleeding Complications

## Stratification of Risk According to Procedures

### Low Risk
**Regional Guidelines:**
- Superficial and compressible plexus/peripheral nerve blocks

**Pain Guidelines:**
- Peripheral nerve blocks
- Joint injections
- Sacroiliac joint and sacral lateral branch blocks

### Intermediate Risk
**Regional Guidelines:**
- Other procedures based on compressibility, patient body habitus, comorbidities, and the degree and duration of anticoagulation

**Pain Guidelines:**
- Neuraxial injections
- Facet procedures
- Visceral sympathetic blocks
- Pocket revision

### High Risk
**Regional Guidelines:**
- Neuraxial blocks
- Deep and noncompressible plexus/peripheral nerve blocks

**Pain Guidelines:**
- Spinal cord stimulator trial and implant
- Intrathecal pump trial and implant
- Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty
- Epiduroscopy

### Patient Characteristics Associated With Increased Sensitivity to Warfarin

- Age >65 y
- Female sex
- Weight <100 lb
- Liver, cardiac, or renal disease
- Asian ancestry
- Excessive surgical blood loss

### Half-lives of Vitamin Kâ€“Dependent Clotting Factors

| Factor   | Half-Life (h) |
|----------|---------------|
| Factor VII | 6â€“8           |
| Factor IX  | 24            |
| Factor X   | 25â€“60         |
| Factor II  | 50â€“80         |

### Perioperative Management of Patients on Warfarin

#### Preoperative
- Discontinue warfarin at least 5 days before elective procedure
- Assess INR 1â€“2 d prior to surgery, if >1.5, consider 1â€“2 mg oral vitamin K
- Reversal for urgent surgery/procedure, consider 2.5â€“5 mg oral or IV vitamin K; for immediate reversal, consider PCCs, fresh frozen plasma
- Patients at high risk of thromboembolism
  - Bridge with therapeutic SC LMWH (preferred) or IV UFH
  - Last dose of preoperative LMWH administered 24 h before surgery, administer half of the daily dose
  - Intravenous heparin discontinued 4â€“6 h before surgery
- No bridging necessary for patients at low risk of thromboembolism

#### Postoperative
- Patients at low risk of thromboembolism
  - Resume warfarin on POD
- Patients at high risk of thromboembolism (who received preoperative bridging therapy)
  - Minor surgical procedureâ€”resume therapeutic LMWH 24 h postoperatively
  - Major surgical procedureâ€”resume therapeutic LMWH 48â€“72 h postoperatively or administer low-dose LMWH
- Assess bleeding risk and adequacy of hemostasis when considering timing of the resumption of LMWH or UFH therapy

## Antiplatelet

### ASRA Guidelines on the Use of Antiplatelet Agents and Neuraxial Techniques

#### NSAIDs
- **Recommendations**: No specific concerns regarding the timing of single-injection or catheter techniques in relation to NSAID dosing, postoperative monitoring, or neuraxial catheter removal.
- **Grade**: 1A

#### Thienopyridines
- **Preoperative Discontinuation Intervals**:
  - **Ticlopidine**: 10 days
  - **Clopidogrel**: 5-7 days
  - **Prasugrel**: 7-10 days
- **Neuraxial Catheter Maintenance**:
  - **Prasugrel or Ticagrelor**: Not recommended due to rapid onset.
  - **Ticlopidine or Clopidogrel**: May be maintained for 1-2 days if no loading dose was given.
- **Grade**: 1C for discontinuation intervals, 2C for catheter maintenance

#### Ticagrelor
- **Preoperative Discontinuation Interval**: 5-7 days
- **Postoperative Resumption**:
  - Immediate if no loading dose.
  - 6 hours post-removal if a loading dose is administered.
- **Neuraxial Catheter Maintenance**: Not recommended due to rapid onset.
- **Grade**: 1C for discontinuation interval, 2C for catheter maintenance

#### Platelet Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa Inhibitors
- **Preoperative Recommendations**: Avoid neuraxial techniques until platelet function has recovered. Patients often have residual NSAID effects due to dual therapy.
- **Postoperative Recommendations**: Contraindicated within 4 weeks of surgery. Timing of catheter removal depends on thromboembolism risk, need for continued antithrombotic therapy, and potential for spinal bleeding.
- **Grade**: Not specified

#### Cilostazol
- **Preoperative Discontinuation Interval**: 2 days
- **Postoperative Recommendations**:
  - Remove catheter before resuming therapy.
  - First postoperative dose can be administered 6 hours after catheter removal.

#### Dabigatran
- **Preoperative**: Discontinue 120 hours prior to a neuraxial block. If renal function is reliable and no additional risk factors for bleeding:
  - **CrCl â‰¥ 80 mL/min**: Discontinue 72 hours prior. Consider checking dTT or Etc if less than 72 hours.
  - **CrCl 50-79 mL/min**: Discontinue 96 hours prior. Consider checking dTT or Etc if less than 96 hours.
  - **CrCl 30-49 mL/min**: Discontinue 120 hours prior. Consider checking dTT or Etc if less than 120 hours.
  - **CrCl < 30 mL/min**: Avoid neuraxial blocks.
- **Postoperative**: Remove neuraxial catheters 6 hours prior to the first postoperative dose. If unanticipated administration with an indwelling catheter, hold dosing for 34-36 hours or assess dTT or Etc prior to removal.
- **Grade**: 2C

## Fibrinolytics and Thrombolytics

### Recommendations
- **Risk**: Patients are at risk of serious hemorrhagic events like spinal hematomas.
- **Avoidance**: Avoid spinal or epidural anesthetics in patients who have received these medications.
- **Post-Procedure Monitoring**: Wait at least 48 hours and document normalization of clotting and fibrinogen levels before proceeding.
- **Catheter Removal**: No definitive recommendation; frequent neurological checks and fibrinogen levels assessment are suggested.
- **Grade**: 1A for avoiding procedures, 2C for monitoring and catheter removal

## Intravenous and Subcutaneous Unfractionated Heparin

### Heparin
#### Intravenous Heparin
- **Preoperative**: Discontinue infusion 4-6 hours prior and verify normal coagulation status before neuraxial block. Delay heparin administration for 1 hour post-needle placement.
- **Postoperative**: Remove indwelling neuraxial catheters 4-6 hours after the last IV heparin dose, assess coagulation status, and reheparinize 1 hour post-removal. Use dilute local anesthetic and monitor for early motor blockade detection.
- **Grade**: 1A

#### Subcutaneous Heparin
- **Preoperative**:
  - **Low-dose (5000 U BID or TID)**: Perform neuraxial block 4-6 hours after administration or assess coagulation status.
  - **Higher-dose (7500-10,000 U BID or daily < 20,000 U)**: Perform neuraxial block 12 hours after administration and assess coagulation status.
  - **Therapeutic-dose (>10,000 U dose or > 20,000 U total daily)**: Perform neuraxial block 24 hours after administration and assess coagulation status.
- **Postoperative**:
  - **Low-dose**: Remove catheter 4-6 hours after administration and resume heparin immediately post-block or catheter removal.
  - **Higher-dose (>5000 U or >15,000 U daily)**: Safety of indwelling catheters not established; assess risks and benefits on a case-by-case basis.
- **Grade**: 2C

## Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin

### Recommendations
- **Antifactor Xa Levels**: Peak 3-5 hours post-administration; elimination 3-6 hours post-SC injection in normal renal function.
- **Concomitant Medications**: Avoid coadministration with antiplatelet or oral anticoagulation medications if an indwelling catheter is present.
- **Monitoring**: Routine antifactor Xa level monitoring is not recommended. Assess platelet count if LMWH is used for more than 4 days before neuraxial block or catheter removal.
- **Grade**: 1A

### Preoperative LMWH Dosing
- **Prophylactic Dose**: Needle placement at least 12 hours after dose.
- **Higher Therapeutic Dose**: Needle placement at least 24 hours after dose.
- **Grade**: 1A

### Postoperative LMWH Dosing
- **BID Prophylactic Dosing**: Increased risk of spinal hematoma; administer the first dose the following day, no earlier than 12 hours post-needle placement. Remove catheters before LMWH initiation and delay administration for 4 hours post-removal.
- **Single Daily Prophylactic Dose**: First postoperative dose at least 12 hours post-needle placement; second dose no sooner than 24 hours after the first. Maintain indwelling catheters, remove 12 hours after the last dose, and resume at least 4 hours post-removal.
- **Single/BID Therapeutic Dose**: Resume 24 hours post non-high-bleeding-risk surgery and 48 hours post high-bleeding-risk surgery. Remove indwelling catheters 4 hours prior to the first postoperative dose or 24 hours post-catheter placement, whichever is greater.
- **Grade**: 1C
