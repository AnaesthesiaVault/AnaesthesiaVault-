# Functions of the Kidney

- **Regulation of Body Fluids**: The kidneys regulate the volume and composition of body fluids by filtering plasma and excreting waste products while maintaining water, osmolality, electrolyte, and acid-base homeostasis.
- **Secretion of Renin**: The kidneys secrete renin, playing a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance.
- **Secretion of Erythropoietin**: The kidneys secrete erythropoietin, which is essential for the production of red blood cells.
- **Vitamin D Conversion**: In the proximal renal tubules, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is converted to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (Vitamin D), crucial for calcium homeostasis.
- **Drug Metabolism and Excretion**: The kidneys play a major role in the metabolism and excretion of many drugs.
## Maintenance of Acid/Base

- **Hydrogen Ion (H+) Secretion**: H+ is minimally filtered by the glomerulus and actively secreted by three mechanisms:
  - Primary active H+ ATPase pump
  - Counter current transport with Na+
  - H+/K+ ATPase
- **Bicarbonate (HCO3-) Reabsorption**: HCO3is easily filtered by the glomerulus and requires reabsorption.
  - H+ is "recycled" to enable the reabsorption of HCO3-.
# Nephron

- **Types of Nephrons**:
  - **Cortical Nephrons**: These have short loops of Henle that extend only into the superficial regions of the renal medulla and often lack a thin ascending limb. They outnumber juxtamedullary nephrons by approximately 7:1.
  - **Juxtamedullary Nephrons**: These have renal corpuscles located near the renal medulla and possess loops of Henle that project deeply into the renal medulla.
- **Components of the Nephron**:
  - Renal corpuscle
  - Proximal convoluted tubule
  - Loop of Henle
  - Distal renal tubule
  - Collecting tubule
  - Juxtaglomerular apparatus

## Sodium Reabsorption

1. **Glomerulus**
	
	- Initial filtration of sodium into the nephron.
2. **Proximal Convoluted Tubule**
	
	- **Reabsorbs:** 65-75% of filtered sodium.
3. **Loop of Henle (Thick Ascending Limb)**
	
	- **Reabsorbs:** 15-20% of filtered sodium.
4. **Distal Convoluted Tubule**
	
	- **Reabsorbs:** 5-7% of filtered sodium.
5. **Collecting Tubule**
	
	- **Reabsorbs:** 5-7% of filtered sodium.
6. **Final Product:** Urine contains minimal sodium, indicating efficient reabsorption throughout the nephron.
## Renal Corpuscle

- **Composition**: The renal corpuscle is composed of a glomerulus and a Bowman capsule.
- **Function**: Ultrafiltrate flows through the nephron’s tubules, where the volume and composition are modified by reabsorption and secretion of solutes, with the final product being urine.
- **Location**: All renal corpuscles are located in the renal cortex.
- **Blood Flow**: Blood enters via a single afferent arteriole and exits through a single efferent arteriole.
- **Reabsorption and Secretion**:
  - Reabsorption: Substances traverse the tubular (apical) side of the cell membrane, cross the basolateral membrane into the renal interstitium, and enter peritubular capillaries.
  - Secretion: Substances move from blood into the urine.
### Histology

#### Cell Types and Parts
- **Three Cell Types**:
  - Glomerular endothelial cells
  - Epithelial cells of Bowman’s capsule
  - Intraglomerular mesangial cells
- **Two Parts**:
  - Glomerular endothelial cells and epithelial cells of Bowman’s capsule are separated by their fused basement membranes.
  - The basement membrane is negatively charged, providing a filtration barrier to cells and large molecules.
#### Specific Cells
- **Glomerular Endothelial Cells**: Perforated with fenestrae (70–100 nm), allowing passage of substances.
- **Epithelial Cells**: Interdigitate to form filtration slits (approximately 25 nm), acting as a filtration barrier.
- **Intraglomerular Mesangial Cells**:
  - Located between the basement membrane and epithelial cells.
  - Contractile cells regulate glomerular blood flow and exhibit phagocytic activity.
  - Contraction is influenced by substances like angiotensin II, vasopressin, norepinephrine, histamine, endothelins, thromboxane A2, leukotrienes (C4 and D4), prostaglandin F2, and platelet-activating factor.
  - Relaxation, increasing filtration, is influenced by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), prostaglandin E2, and dopaminergic agonists.
### Glomerular Filtration Pressure

- **Pressure**: 60 mmHg (60% of MAP)
- **Opposition**: Plasma oncotic pressure (25 mmHg) and renal interstitial pressure (10 mmHg).
- **Filtration Pressure**: Directly proportional to efferent arteriolar tone and inversely proportional to afferent tone.
- **Filtration Rate**: 20% of plasma is normally filtered into the Bowman capsule.
## Proximal Tubule

- **Filtrate Reabsorption**: 65% to 75% of filtrate is reabsorbed isotonically.
- **Primary Function**: Sodium (Na) reabsorption.
### Mechanisms of Na Reabsorption and Other Ions

1. **Na+-K+-ATPase**: Exchanges 3 Na+ for 2 K+, creating a low intracellular Na+ concentration, favoring the absorption of other cations (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+).
2. **Passive Movement**: Na+ moves down its concentration gradient into tubular epithelial cells.
  - Enhanced by angiotensin II and norepinephrine; decreased by dopamine and fenoldopam.
3. **Coupled Reabsorption**: Na+ reabsorption coupled with solutes like phosphate, glucose, and amino acids.
4. **Countertransport (Secretion) of H+**: Responsible for reabsorption of 90% of filtered bicarbonate ions.
### Other Ion/Molecule Movement

- **Chloride**: Passively absorbed.
- **Water**: Passively absorbed via aquaporin-1 channels.
- **Secretion of Organic Cations and Anions**:
  - Creatinine secretion can be inhibited by other organic cations.
  - Organic anions like urates, ketoacids, penicillins, cephalosporins, diuretics, salicylates, and most radiocontrast dyes share common secretory mechanisms and compete with each other.
- **Low-Molecular-Weight Proteins**: Reabsorbed by proximal tubular epithelial cells for intracellular metabolism.
## Loop of Henle

- **Parts**: Ascending (functional) and descending limbs.
- **Functions**: Maintaining a hypertonic medullary interstitium and concentrating urine.
- **Filtrate Reabsorption**: 25% to 35% of ultrafiltrate formed in Bowman’s capsule reaches the loop, where 15% to 20% of filtered sodium is reabsorbed.
- **Ascending Limb**: Impermeable to water; reabsorbs Na+ and Cl-.
  - Fluid exiting the loop is hypotonic.
- **Countercurrent Multiplier Mechanism**:
  - Dependent on differential permeability and transport characteristics between descending and ascending limbs.
  - Active Na+ reabsorption in the thick ascending limb results from Na+-K+-ATPase activity.
  - **Magnesium and Calcium Reabsorption**: Promoted by parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the thick ascending limb.
## Distal Tubule

- **Function**: Receives hypotonic fluid from the loop of Henle; maintains gradients generated by the loop.
- **Na Reabsorption**: 5% of Na is reabsorbed via Na+-Clcarriers, proportional to Na+ delivery.
- **Calcium Reabsorption**: Major site for PTH and vitamin D-mediated reabsorption.
- **Connecting Segment**: Aldosterone-mediated Na+ reabsorption.
## Collecting Tubule

### Role in Maintaining Hypertonic Medulla

- **Urea Permeability**:
  - Cortical collecting tubules are permeable to urea.
  - Medullary collecting tubules are normally impermeable to urea but become more permeable in the presence of vasopressin, increasing medullary tonicity.
### Two Types

#### Cortical Collecting Tubules

- **Principal Cells**: Secrete potassium and reabsorb Na+ in response to aldosterone.
  - Aldosterone enhances Na+-K+-ATPase activity, increasing K+ and Na+ channel availability.
- **Intercalated Cells**: Regulate acid-base balance.
  - Secrete bicarbonate ions in response to alkaline loads.
#### Medullary Collecting Tubules

- **ADH/Vasopressin Action**: Stimulates water reabsorption via aquaporin-2 channels.
- **Dehydration**: Increased ADH secretion leads to concentrated urine.
- **Hydration**: Suppressed ADH secretion results in hypotonic urine.
- **Acidification of Urine**: Responsible for urine acidification via titratable acids and ammonium ions.
## Juxtaglomerular Apparatus

- **Composition**: Specialized segment of the afferent arteriole containing juxtaglomerular cells and the macula densa, part of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.
### Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)

#### Trigger: Decrease in Blood Pressure

- **Detected by**:
  - Renal perfusion pressure (afferent arterioles, macula densa)
  - Sympathetic nervous system activation
#### Juxtaglomerular Apparatus of Kidneys

- **Produces**: Pro-renin, which is converted to renin
#### Liver

- **Produces**: Angiotensinogen (AGT)
#### Renin's Role

- **Converts AGT to**: Angiotensin I (Ang I)
#### Pulmonary and Renal Endothelium

- **Produces**: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
#### ACE's Role

- **Converts Ang I to**: Angiotensin II (Ang II)
#### Angiotensin II's Effects

- **Adrenal Gland**:
  - Releases aldosterone
	- Increases Na\(^+\), Cl\(^-\), H\(_2\)O reabsorption and K\(^+\) excretion
- **Arterioles**:
  - Causes vasoconstriction
- **Pituitary Gland**:
  - Stimulates ADH secretion
- **Sympathetic Nervous System**:
  - Increases activity
#### Overall Effect

- **Increase in Blood Pressure**:
  - Water and salt retention
  - Increased circulatory volume
  - Increased perfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus
- Juxtaglomerular cells synthesize renin and are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system.
- Release of renin depends on β1-adrenergic sympathetic stimulation, changes in afferent arteriolar wall pressure, and changes in chloride flow past the macula densa.
- Renin released into the bloodstream catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen, a protein synthesized by the liver, to angiotensin I.
- Angiotensin I is rapidly converted, primarily in the lungs, by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to form the octapeptide angiotensin II.
- Proximal renal tubular cells have ACE as well as angiotensin II receptors.
- Intrarenal formation of angiotensin II enhances sodium reabsorption in proximal tubules. Extrarenal production of renin and angiotensin II also occurs in the vascular endothelium, adrenal glands, and brain.
## Renal Blood Flow (RBF)

- **Oxygen Consumption**: The kidneys are unique in that oxygen consumption is determined by blood flow.
- **Cardiac Output**: The kidneys receive 20% to 25% of total cardiac output.
- **Distribution**: 80% of RBF goes to cortical nephrons, and 10% to 15% goes to juxtamedullary nephrons.
- **Renal Cortex**: Extracts little oxygen due to high blood flow for filtration (oxygen tension: 50 mmHg).
- **Renal Medulla**: Maintains high metabolic activity due to solute reabsorption and requires low blood flow to maintain high osmotic gradients (oxygen tension: 15 mmHg), making it vulnerable to ischemia.
- **Redistribution of RBF**: Occurs under conditions like sympathetic stimulation, increased levels of catecholamines and angiotensin II, and heart failure, favoring juxtamedullary nephrons.
- **Functional Anatomy**: Each kidney is supplied by a single renal artery from the aorta. The renal artery divides into interlobar arteries, arcuate arteries, and interlobular branches, supplying each nephron via a single afferent arteriole. Blood from each glomerular capillary tuft drains via a single efferent arteriole into a peritubular capillary system, favoring reabsorption. Venules from this plexus return blood to the inferior vena cava via a single renal vein.
## Renal Plasma Flow (RPF)

- **Measurement**: Measured by p-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance, which can be completely cleared from plasma by filtration and secretion in one passage through the kidneys.
- **Normal Values**: RPF and RBF are approximately 660 mL/min and 1200 mL/min, respectively.
## Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)

- **Definition**: The volume of fluid filtered from the glomerular capillaries into the Bowman capsule per unit time, normally approximating 20% of RPF.
- **Measurement**: Clearance of inulin (completely filtered but not secreted or reabsorbed) is a good measure of GFR. Normal values are approximately 120 ± 25 mL/min in men and 95 ± 20 mL/min in women. Creatinine clearance, while practical, tends to overestimate GFR due to some secretion by renal tubules.
- **Filtration Fraction (FF)**: The ratio of GFR to RPF, normally 20%.
- **Regulation**: GFR is dependent on the relative tones of afferent and efferent arterioles. Afferent arteriolar dilation or efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction can increase FF and maintain GFR, even when RPF decreases.
## Control Mechanisms Regulating RBF

### Intrinsic Regulation: Autoregulation of RBF

- **Range**: Maintained between a MAP of 80 and 180 mm Hg due to intrinsic myogenic responses of afferent glomerular arterioles to blood pressure changes.
- **Outside Limits**: RBF becomes pressure-dependent outside these autoregulation limits. Glomerular filtration generally ceases when mean systemic arterial pressure is less than 50 mmHg.
### Tubuloglomerular Feedback

- **Function**: Maintains constant GFR over a wide range of perfusion pressures.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Increased tubular flow secondary to increased GFR reflexively promotes a reduced GFR.
  - Decreased tubular flow secondary to decreased GFR reflexively promotes an increased GFR.
  - This involves macula densa and mesangial cells, which react to changes in GFR by altering afferent arteriolar tone via modulation of local release of calcium, renin, and adenosine.
### Hormonal Regulation

#### RAAS

- **Triggers**: Decreased afferent glomerular arteriolar pressure, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and decreased distal tubule sodium load stimulate RAAS, causing generalized arterial vasoconstriction and reduced RBF. High levels of angiotensin II constrict both afferent and efferent arterioles, potentially decreasing GFR.
#### Epinephrine and Norepinephrine

- **Action**: Increase afferent arteriolar tone but usually do not markedly decrease GFR due to simultaneous increase in renin release and angiotensin II formation.
#### Aldosterone and Catecholamines

- **Mediation**: Relative preservation of GFR during increased aldosterone or catecholamine secretion is mediated by angiotensin-induced prostaglandin synthesis, which can be blocked by NSAIDs.
#### Prostaglandins

- **Role**: Vasodilating prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE2, and PGI2) protect during systemic hypotension and kidney stress.
#### ANP

- **Function**: Promotes vasodilation and renal excretion of sodium and water, released from atrial myocytes in response to atrial distension. It dilates afferent glomerular arteriole, constricts efferent arteriole, and relaxes mesangial cells, increasing GFR.
### Neuronal and Paracrine Regulation

- **Sympathetic Innervation**: From the spinal cord (T4–L1) via the celiac and renal plexuses.
- **Sympathetic Activity**: Reduces RBF through β1-adrenergic stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus and α1-adrenergic constriction of renal vasculature.
- **α1-Adrenergic Receptors**: Enhance sodium reabsorption in proximal tubules.
- **α2-Adrenergic Receptors**: Decrease sodium reabsorption and promote water excretion.
- **Dopamine and Fenoldopam**: Dilate afferent and efferent arterioles via D1-receptor activation.
