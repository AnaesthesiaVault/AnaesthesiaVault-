# Renal Dysfunction and Perioperative Acute Kidney Injury

Renal dysfunction is linked to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 50 ml.min⁻¹.1.73 m², classified as stage 3a chronic kidney disease, is associated with excess morbidity. A rise in creatinine of 44 µmol·L⁻¹ has been associated with an odds ratio of 6.5 for death and an increased length of hospital stay by 3.5 days. One in three cases of acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs perioperatively.

## KDIGO Classification Criteria for Acute Kidney Injury

### Stage 1
- **Serum [creatinine] increase**: 1.5–1.9 times baseline or ≥ 26.5 µmol·L⁻¹ (0.3 mg·dL⁻¹)
- **Urine output**: < 0.5 mL·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹ for 6–12 h

### Stage 2
- **Serum [creatinine] increase**: 2.0–2.9 times baseline
- **Urine output**: < 0.5 mL·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹ for ≥ 12 h

### Stage 3
- **Serum [creatinine] increase**: 3.0 times baseline or ≥ 353.6 µmol·L⁻¹ (4.0 mg·dL⁻¹)
- **Urine output**: < 0.3 mL·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹ for ≥ 24 h or anuria ≥ 12 h

### Defining CKD

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is diagnosed based on eGFR values (< 90 ml.min⁻¹.1.73 m²) from two or more creatinine measurements taken at least 90 days apart. Episodes shorter than this are termed acute kidney disease, which might precede chronic disease even if eGFR subsequently exceeds 90 ml.min⁻¹.1.73 m².

### Pathophysiology

Perioperative renal dysfunction involves multiple factors:

- **Arterial Hypotension**: Reduces the normal net pressure of 25 mmHg that drives ultrafiltration through the glomerulus, decreasing with lower cardiac output.
- **Inflammation, Vascular Injury, and Tubular Obstruction**: Often accompany reduced ultrafiltration.
- **Intercellular Tight Junction Disruption**: Leads to cell shedding into the tubular lumen and loss of transmembrane ion channel polarity.
- **Elevated Intratubular Pressure**: Decreases glomerular filtration and activates tubule-glomerular feedback, causing pre-glomerular vasoconstriction.

## Major Risk Factors for Perioperative AKI

### Patient Factors
- Chronic kidney disease
- Heart failure
- Hypertension
- Peripheral arterial disease
- Obstructive pulmonary disease
- Diabetes mellitus
- Alcoholism
- Male gender
- Obesity
- Age > 65 years

### Surgical Factors
- Emergency surgery
- Non-renal solid organ transplant
- Cardiac bypass time
- Aortic cross clamp

### Other Factors
- Acute illness
- Sepsis
- Multi-organ dysfunction
- Nephrotoxic drugs:
  - ACE inhibitors
  - Angiotensin receptor blockers
  - Diuretics
  - Radio-opaque intravenous contrast

## Prevention Strategies

### Preoperative
- Modify risk factors
- Ensure patients are hydrated and euvolemic
- Remove nephrotoxic drugs

### Intraoperative
- Maintain cardiac output and renal perfusion
  - Avoid prolonged intraoperative hypotension
- Avoid fluid overload
  - Use goal-directed fluid therapy to achieve target hemodynamic goals
- Fluid choice
  - Avoid semi-synthetic colloids; prefer balanced solutions over 0.9% saline to prevent hyperchloremic acidosis

### Postoperative
- Monitor postoperative oliguria carefully; avoid unnecessary fluid infusions
- Recognize that no drugs effectively prevent AKI
  - Dopamine and fenoldopam are still used but lack evidence for preventing AKI
- Ensure adequate renal function indicated by urine output > 400 mL/day without diuretic drugs, which correlates with reduced need for renal support.
