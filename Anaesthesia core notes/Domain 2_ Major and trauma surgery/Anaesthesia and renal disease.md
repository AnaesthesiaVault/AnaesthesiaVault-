# Renal Disease

Preoperative renal dysfunction is an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality. Creatinine is a product of skeletal muscle metabolism and undergoes little renal tubular secretion, so creatinine clearance reflects the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The normal GFR is 125 mL/min.

### Rules of Thumb

- GFR must be reduced by 50% before serum creatinine starts to rise.
- Small changes in serum creatinine in the low (normal) range imply a large change in GFR, making the test very sensitive.
- GFR falls by 1% per annum after 30 years of age.
- Low muscle mass (e.g., small elderly lady) means little creatinine to clear, so normal plasma creatinine may not indicate normal renal function.

Serum creatinine levels greater than 200 µmol/L are an independent risk factor for cardiac complications and mortality.

#### Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)

- **Protein catabolism:** Ammonia is produced from the deamination of amino acids.
- **Hepatic conversion:** Conversion of ammonia to urea by the liver prevents the build-up of toxic ammonia levels.
- **Relationship to protein catabolism and filtration:** BUN levels are directly related to protein catabolism and inversely related to glomerular filtration.
- **Indicator of GFR:** BUN is not a reliable indicator of GFR unless protein catabolism is normal and constant. Normally, 40% to 50% of the urea filtrate is passively reabsorbed by the renal tubules. Hypovolemia increases this reabsorption fraction.

#### Creatinine

- **Daily production:** Men produce 20 to 25 mg/kg of creatinine daily; women produce 15 to 20 mg/kg.
- **Renal handling:** Creatinine is filtered and minimally secreted, but not reabsorbed in the kidneys. Serum creatinine concentration is directly related to body muscle mass and inversely related to glomerular filtration.
- **Limitations in critical illness:** A single serum creatinine measurement may not accurately reflect GFR in critically ill patients due to abnormal creatinine production and volume distribution.
- **Postoperative increases:** Even small postoperative increases in serum creatinine are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
- **GFR and serum creatinine:** Doubling of serum creatinine indicates a 50% reduction in GFR.
- **Age-related changes:** GFR declines by 5% per decade after age 20, but because muscle mass also declines, serum creatinine levels remain relatively normal. Creatinine production may decrease to 10 mg/kg.
- **Older adults:** Small increases in serum creatinine may indicate significant changes in GFR. The Cockcroft-Gault formula is recommended for accurate measurement.
- **Equilibration time:** Serum creatinine requires 48 to 72 hours to equilibrate at a new level following acute changes in GFR.
##### Cockcroft–Gault Formula

**Creatinine clearance (mL/min)**  
Creatinine clearance=(140−age)×weight (kg)/0.814×serum creatinine(μmol/L)

### Creatinine Clearance

#### Clearance

- **Definition:** The renal clearance of a substance is defined as the volume of blood that is completely cleared of that substance per unit of time.
- **Assessment of GFR:** It is the most accurate method available for clinically assessing GFR. The test usually takes 24 hours, though a 2-hour creatinine clearance test is also accurate.
- **Levels of creatinine clearance:**
	- **Mild:** 40 to 60 mL/min.
	- **Moderate:** 25 to 40 mL/min, always causes symptoms.
	- **Overt kidney failure:** Less than 25 mL/min.
- **Effect of later-stage kidney disease:** In later-stage kidney disease, increased creatinine secretion in the proximal tubule leads to creatinine clearance progressively overestimating the true GFR as kidney function declines.
### GFR Measurement

#### Clearance of Exogenous Tracers

- **Inulin:**
	- Inulin is filtered but not secreted or reabsorbed, making it the gold standard for GFR measurement.
	- Procedure: Administer a bolus and infusion, then wait for equilibration prior to sample taking.
	- Calculation: GFR = Clearance of inulin = Uinulin×Q/Pinulin
	- Filtration fraction = GFR/RPF = 0.2 (normally).

#### Creatinine Clearance

- **Concept:** Same as above.
- **Endogenous:** Creatinine is endogenous, but a small amount is secreted and reabsorbed, making it not completely accurate.
- **Clinical stability:** It is also inaccurate in a clinically unstable environment or if creatinine levels are very low.

#### Nomograms

- **Purpose:** Predict creatinine clearance based on a single creatinine plasma level.
- **Cockcroft-Gault Equation:**
	- Creatinine clearance=(140−age)×weight (kg)/0.814×serum creatinine(μmol/L)
	- ×0.85 for women

#### Urine to Creatinine Ratio
- **Normal:** 10:1.
- **Prerenal cause:** More than 20:1 indicates a prerenal cause of dysfunction.
# AKI

## Definition

- **AKI:** A syndrome characterized by a rapid (hours to days) deterioration of kidney function.
- **Duration:** AKI is defined as occurring over 7 days, whereas chronic kidney disease (CKD) starts when kidney disease persists for more than 90 days.
- **Incidence:** AKI is a common and underappreciated perioperative problem, occurring in 1% to 5% of all hospitalized patients and in approximately 50% of all ICU patients.

### Limitations of KDIGO Criteria

- **Lack of GFR Reliance:** KDIGO criteria do not rely on changes in GFR for staging, except in children under the age of 18 years.
- **Misclassification Risk:**
	- AKI misclassification may result from the lack of a uniform approach to estimate baseline serum creatinine (SCr).
	- Changes in SCr concentrations can result from acute severe illness and altered fluid balance.
- **Urine Output Data:** Exact data on urine output are not always available, leading to underutilization of the urine output criteria.
- **Serum Creatinine Influences:** Serum creatinine is affected by several factors other than renal function, which can affect its reliability as a marker.

## Preoperative Considerations
- Allow 4–6 hours to elapse after haemodialysis before surgery to permit fluid compartment equilibration and metabolism of residual heparin.

## Complications Specific to Anaesthesiologists

- **Cardiovascular Dysfunction:** Tailoring of blood pressure, cardiac risk assessment, management of heart failure.
- **Electrolyte and Metabolic Disorders:** Hypokalemia, calcium salt management, adequate solution monitoring.
- **Coagulopathy:** Management includes transfusion, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA), heparin-free haemodialysis, and discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy.
- **Disturbance of Equilibrium:** Goal-directed therapy, stroke volume variation (SVV), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO₂), fluid therapy management.
- **Pharmacologic Issues:** Appropriate drug choice.
- **Renal Anemia:** ESA, transfusion, prevention of alloimmunization.

## General Rules
1. Reversible decreases in renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary flow, and sodium excretion occur during both neuraxial and general anaesthesia.
2. These changes are usually less pronounced during neuraxial anaesthesia.
3. Most changes are indirect and mediated by autonomic and hormonal responses to surgery and anaesthesia.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is less likely when adequate intravascular volume and normal blood pressure are maintained.
5. Currently utilized volatile anesthetic agents do not cause AKI in humans.

## Risk Factors for Developing AKI Perioperatively

### Patient Factors
- Chronic diseases: Kidney disease, heart failure, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism.
- Male gender.
- Obesity.
- Age > 65 years.

### Surgery Factors
- Emergency surgery.
- Non-renal solid organ transplant.
- Cardiac bypass time.
- Aortic cross-clamp.

### Other Factors
- Acute illness.
- Sepsis.
- Multi-organ dysfunction.
- Nephrotoxic drugs (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics, radio-opaque intravenous contrast).

## Indirect Anaesthesia Effects

### Cardiovascular System (CVS)
- Decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP), decreased venous tone leading to venous pooling, decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR), heart rate (HR), contractility, and cardiac output (CO).
- Blood pressure decreases below the limits of autoregulation reduce RBF, GFR, urinary flow, and sodium excretion, adversely impacting kidney function.

### Neurological
- Increased sympathetic tone (anxiety, pain, light anaesthesia, surgical stimulation).
- Increases renal vascular resistance and activates several hormonal systems, reducing RBF, GFR, and urine output.

### Endocrine
- Stress response: Increases in epinephrine, norepinephrine, renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol.
- Catecholamines, ADH, and angiotensin II reduce RBF by inducing renal arterial constriction.
- Nonosmotic release of ADH favors water retention and may result in hyponatremia.
- The endocrine response to surgery and anaesthesia contributes to transient fluid retention postoperatively.

## Drugs and Toxins Associated with Acute Kidney Injury

### Decreased Renal Perfusion
- NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, radiocontrast agents, amphotericin B, cyclosporine, tacrolimus.

### Direct Tubular Injury
- Aminoglycosides, radiocontrast agents, amphotericin B, methotrexate, cisplatin, foscarnet, pentamidine, heavy metals, myoglobin, hemoglobin, intravenous immunoglobulin, HIV protease inhibitors.

### Intratubular Obstruction
- Radiocontrast agents, methotrexate, acyclovir, sulfonamides, ethylene glycol, uric acid, cocaine, lovastatin.

### Immunological-Inflammatory
- Penicillin, cephalosporins, allopurinol, NSAIDs, sulfonamides, diuretics, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine, proton pump inhibitors, tetracycline, phenytoin.

## Blood Workup
- **FBC:** Normochromic normocytic anaemia due to decreased erythropoiesis. Maintain hemoglobin (HB) at 8-10 g/dL.
- **UCE and CMP:** Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia due to water retention, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.
- **ABG:** Mild metabolic acidosis with poor compensatory ability.
- **Coagulation:** INR, APTT, and platelet count usually normal. Uremia affects platelet function and prolongs bleeding time. Dialysis improves coagulation once heparin wears off. Thrombocytopathy is not corrected by platelet transfusion but may be improved by cryoprecipitate or desmopressin (0.3 micrograms/kg in 30 mL of saline over 30 min).

## Preoperative Therapy Recommendations

### Continue
- β-blockers
- Calcium channel blockers
- Digoxin
- Statins
- H₂-blockers and proton pump inhibitors
- Inhaled β-agonists
- Glucocorticoids
- Leukotriene inhibitors

### Discontinue
- α₂-agonists
- Non-statin hypolipidemic agents
- Theophylline

## Recommendations for Nephroprotective Measures

## Aetiologies of Perioperative Acute Kidney Injury

### Pre-renal
- **Preoperative:** Hypovolemia (gastrointestinal losses, hemorrhage, third spacing), sepsis, cardiac failure, increased intra-abdominal pressure, cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome.
- **Intraoperative:** Hypovolemia (insensible losses, hemorrhage, over diuresis), hypotension (low SVR, anesthesia-induced), low CO (heart failure, anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass CPB-induced), increased intra-abdominal pressure, aortic cross-clamp.

### Intrinsic
- **Preoperative and Perioperative:** Inflammation (patient comorbidities: chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, atherosclerosis), drug-induced (antibiotics, aspirin, phenytoin, furosemide, NSAIDs, clopidogrel, tacrolimus), radiocontrast agents, endogenous nephrotoxins (hemoglobin and myoglobin), acidosis, infection, CPB, anemia (packed red blood cell administration), fluid solutions (hydroxyethyl starch, chloride-rich solutions).

### Post-renal
- **Preoperative:** Tumor, prostatic enlargement, calculi, blood clots, neurogenic bladder.
- **Intraoperative:** Surgical intervention or damage.
## Anaesthesia Drugs and CKD

### Principles
- Loading doses of drugs are often unchanged, but maintenance doses should be reduced or the dosing interval prolonged.
- Hypoalbuminaemia and acidosis increase the free drug availability of highly protein-bound drugs
- Most anaesthetic drugs and techniques reduce renal blood flow, GFR, and urine outpu
 
### Anaesthetic Drugs

#### Premedication
- **Drugs safe in CRF:** Lormetazepam, midazolam, temazepam

#### Induction
- **Drugs safe in CRF:** Propofol
- **Drugs safe in limited or reduced doses:** Ketamine, etomidate, thiopental
- Reduce the doses of benzodiazepines, thiopental, and etomidate by ~30% because of changes in protein-binding, volume of distribution, and cardiac function.
- Propofol dose needs to be increased
- Wake-up following infusion is faster

#### Maintenance
- **Drugs safe in CRF:** Isoflurane, desflurane, halothane, propofol
- **Drugs safe in limited or reduced doses:** Sevoflurane
- **Drugs contraindicated in CRF:** Enflurane

#### Muscle Relaxants
- **Drugs safe in CRF:** Suxamethonium, atracurium, cisatracurium
- **Drugs safe in limited or reduced doses:** Vecuronium, rocuronium
- **Drugs contraindicated in CRF:** Pancuronium

#### Opioids
- **Drugs safe in CRF:** Alfentanil, remifentanil
- **Drugs safe in limited or reduced doses:** Fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone
- **Drugs contraindicated in CRF:** Pethidine, codeine, tramadol

#### Local Anaesthetics
- **Drugs safe in limited or reduced doses:** Bupivacaine, lidocaine (reduce dose by 25%)

- Other: Sugammadex

## Management of AKI

### Acute Management
- Risk assessment, primary prevention, early diagnosis.
- Hemodynamic stabilization of CO and BP.
- Adequate volume expansion without overload/accumulation. Sepsis guidelines allow 30 mL/kg in the acute, early phase (supported by VASTT trial), continuing as long as patient is responsive to fluid challenge, followed by a conservative strategy thereafter (FACTT trial).

### Further Treatment
- Assessment of the cause and volemic status.
- Avoid nephrotoxic agents.
- Rationalized exposure to contrast.
- Management of complications:
  - Fluid overload: Fluid restriction, trial of diuretics, positive pressure ventilation (PPV) ± intubation.
  - Hyperkalemia: Potassium shift therapies.
- Nutritional support.
- Renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the context of lab trends.
# Management of AV-Fistula

- **Avoid Cannulation and Non-Invasive Blood Pressure (NIBP) in This Arm:** To prevent damage and maintain the integrity of the fistula.
- **Cannulate the Dorsum of the Hand:** This practice avoids damage to the veins in the forearm and antecubital fossa, which are needed for future fistulae.

## Anaesthesia for AV Fistula Formation

- **Location of Fistula Formation:**
	- **Brachiobasilic Fistula:** Local infiltration is used.
	- **Brachiocephalic Fistula:** An axillary or supraclavicular brachial plexus block is recommended. Additional local anesthesia (LA) may be required in the axilla.
- **Avoid Hypotension:** Preventing hypotension is crucial to avoid fistula thrombosis.
- **Usage Timeline:**
	- **Fistula:** Can be used for dialysis after 3–4 weeks.
	- **Synthetic Grafts:** Can be used immediately but do not last as long as fistulas.
