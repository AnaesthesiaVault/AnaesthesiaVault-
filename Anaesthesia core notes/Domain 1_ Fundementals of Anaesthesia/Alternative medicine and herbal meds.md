# General
- **Recommendation**
	- As pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data are lacking, the American Society of Anaesthesiologists recommends that patients discontinue the use of herbal medications 2â€“3 weeks before surgery
	- The risk of haematoma formation post-neuroaxial block in patients taking herbal medicines which impair platelet function is unknown.
