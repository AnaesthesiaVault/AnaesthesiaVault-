# Pharmacology
**Vd =** Drug dose/plasma concentration in L  
**Cl =** Rate of elimination/concentration of drug in ml/min  
**Clss =** Maintenance dose/Steady state concentration  
**At steady state, rate of elimination =** rate of administration (maintenance dose)  
**Metabolism of an organ (rate of elimination):** Blood flow (Q) x (Concentration entering organ - Concentration leaving organ)  
**Organ clearance =** Q x ([] entering x [] leaving) ÷ inflow concentration
  - Q = Blood flow
  - Inflow concentration can be seen as concentration of drug as above  
**Hepatic extraction ratio =** Plasma Clearance/Liver blood flow  
**Bioavailability =** AUC for oral drug ÷ AUC for IV drug  
**AUC:** Area under the curve (proportional to the amount of drug introduced into the systemic circulation. In the plasma [] vs time)  
**Half-life =** (0.693 x Vd) ÷ Clearance  
**Loading dose =** Required [] at steady state x Vd  

# General
**Seconds per drop =** 60 seconds ÷ [(Drops/ml) x (ml per hour/60)]. Drops per second = 1/answer
## Pressure
**PSI to Bar =** x 0.069  
**PSI to KPa =** x 6.9  
**KPa to Bar =** x 100  
**Bar to PSI =** x 14.5  

**Calculation of time left in oxygen E cylinder:**
- Boles law: P1V1 = P2V2
- 137 x 5L = ATM pressure (1) x Flow per minute
- 700 ÷ flow per minute = time left in minute
## Ideal Body Weight
**Constant + (0.9) x (height in cm - 152)**
  - Constant
	- Male: 50
	- Female: 45.5
**Alternative:**
  - Height in cm - 105 (men)
  - Height in cm - 100 (women)

# Respiratory

**Oxygenation index:**
- (Mean airway pressure x FiO2%) ÷ (PaO2 x 7.5)
  - More than 10: not weanable
  - 5-10: not ready for extubation
  - Less than 5: consider extubation

**RSBI: (only on PSV <10 cmH2O)**
- RR/Tidal volume in litres
  - ≥ 105: don’t remove from PSV
  - < 105: consider removing from PSV

**A-a Gradient:**
- Calculated PaO2 - Measured PaO2
  - Calculated PaO2 = (FiO2 x 713) x (PaCO2 ÷ 0.8)
  - Normal: 5-10. Increased with VQ mismatch

**Transpulmonary pressure:**
- Alveolar pressure - Intrapleural pressure
  - Inspiration: diaphragm contracts and moves down. Alveoli expand and pressure decreases (-1) intrapleural pressure also decreases (-7). Pressure gradient down into lungs.
  - Expiration: Diaphragm relaxes and pushes up. Pressure increases and gradient changes and air flows out.

**Surface tension (Stabilization of alveolar size):**
- Alveolar pressure = (2 x surface tension ÷ radius)
  - If surface tension increases, you will have a decrease in radius (surface area) for gas exchanges
  - *Surfactant decreases surface tension*

**Compliance:**
- Volume/Pressure
  - Lung compliance: Lung volume/transpulmonary pressure
  - Chest compliance: Chest volume/transthoracic post pressure

**Non-Elastic airway resistance:**
- Pressure gradient = Flow² x (Gas density ÷ Radius⁵)
  - Flow: Pressure gradient/Airway resistance

**Airway resistance:**
- FEV1/FVC
  - >70% normal

**Henry’s law:**
- [ ] of any gas in solution is proportional to its partial pressure
  - Gas [] = solubility x partial pressure
  - Dissolved O2 [] = 0.003 x PaO2

**Total O2 concentration in blood:**
- Dissolved O2 (0.003 x PaO2) + Oxyhemoglobin (SO2 x Hb x 1.31)
  - PaO2 for arterial (CaO2): 100
  - PaO2 for mixed venous (CvO2): 40
  - Thus arteriovenous difference (excellent measure for overall O2 delivery): CaO2 - CvO2 (Normal = 5)

**Oxygen consumption (VO2):**
- CO x (CaO2 - CvO2)
  - Normally consume 25% of O2 carried on Hb. Can increase or decrease in response to less or more supply. With decrease in DO2 (CaO2 x CO) and extraction cannot compensate further with increase, a critical point is reached where consumption (VO2) is directly proportional to delivery (DO2). Seen with acidosis and cellular hypoxia.

**Oxygen stores content:**
- FiO2 x FRC
  - Thus increasing FRC will prolong time to desaturation. The basis for pre-oxygenation.
# Renal and Endocrine

- Doubling in creatinine represents 50% reduction in GFR.
**Creatinine clearance:**
- (140 - Age) x (lean body weight) ÷ 72 x plasma creatinine in mg/dL
  - *In women x equation by 0.85*
  - *Conversion of mg/dL to umol/L = mg/dL x 88.4*

**eGFR (Schwartz):**
- 40 x (height ÷ creatinine)
  - Normal: 80-120
## Metabolic/Electrolytes

- Conversion from mmHg to KPa: mmHg ÷ 7.5
- Venous PCO2 0.5-0.8 KPa > PaCO2 thus pH 0.05 lower in venous blood

**Potassium movement:**
- 0.6 mEq/L for each 0.1 decrease in pH
### Acidosis
- Decrease CO (Decreased Contractility and SVR)
- Tissue hypoxia
- Rightward shift of oxyhemoglobin curve
- Decrease response to catecholamine
- Increase potassium
- CNS depression (Respiratory acidosis)
#### Respiratory Acidosis
- PaCO2 = CO2 production ÷ Alveolar ventilation
  - Metabolic (renal compensation)
	- A PaCO2 increase of 10 mmHg above 40 mmHg HCO3 will increase 1 mEq/L (from 24) (Acute) - 4 mEq/L (Chronic)
	  - *Takes 3-5 days*
#### Metabolic Acidosis
- Respiratory compensation (Winters formula)
  - Expected PaCO2 in mmHg: (1.5 x HCO3) + 8 (+/-2)
  - Or Decrease PaCO2 1-1.5 mmHg from 40 mmHg for each 1 mEq/L decrease in HCO3
  - *12-24 hours to compensate*

**Anion Gap (always correct for albumin):**
- (Na + K) - (HCO3 + Cl)
  - 12 +/- 4. >30 definite high anion gap metabolic acidosis
  - AG + (0.25 x (40 - albumin in g/dL))
	- *High:* Renal failure/Lactic acidosis/Ketoacidosis (DKA/Alcohol/Starvation)/Drugs
	- *Low:* GIT losses of HCO3 (Diarrhoea, fistulas)/Renal losses of HCO3 (RTA); NaCl 0.9%
**Delta Gap:**
- Combined metabolic process:
  - (Anion gap - 12) + HCO3
	- > 30: metabolic alkalosis
	- 18-30: No additional disorders
	- < 18: additional non-gap metabolic acidosis
### Alkalosis
- Shift oxyhemoglobin curve to left
- Hypokalemia
- Hypocalcemia
- Bronchoconstriction
- Decrease cerebral blood flow (hypocarbia)
- Pulmonary vasodilation
#### Metabolic Alkalosis
- Respiratory compensation:
  - Increase PaCO2 0.25-1 mmHg for each 1 mEq/L increase in HCO3
  - Or (0.7 x HCO3) + 20 (+/-5)
	- *Max compensation is PaCO2 = 55 mmHg or 7.3 KPa (hypoxic drive will start)*
	  - *Takes 12-24 hours*
#### Respiratory Alkalosis
- Metabolic compensation:
  - HCO3 decreases 2 (Acute) - 5 (Chronic) mEq/L for each 10 mmHg decrease in PaCO2 below 40 mmHg.
### Serum Osmol
- 2 (Na + K) + Urea + glucose
  - 285-295
### Total Body Water Deficit (Hypernatremia)
- Water deficit = Normal TBW - Present TBW
  - Step 1: Normal TBW
	- (0.6 x weight) *0.5 in females*
  - Step 2: Present TBW (with high

 sodium)

	- (Normal TBW x 140) ÷ Patient's current Sodium

  - Step 3:
	- Step 1 - Step 2 (Normal TBW - Present TBW) = Water deficit in litres.
	  - *Replace over 48 hours. To determine rate: Convert water deficit to ml/hours*
### Sodium Deficit (Hyponatremia)
- Na deficit in mEq = TBW x (Desired Na - Present Na)
  - Replacement of Na with NaCl 0.9%
	- NaCl 0.9% = 154 mEq of Na thus to replace: Na deficit ÷ 154 = replacement value of NaCl in L
	  - *Replace over 48 hours*
		- Replacement value (ml) ÷ 48 hours = ml/h
### Corrected Calcium
- [(40 - albumin) x 0.02] + calcium
## Insulin Management Intra-operative
- Goal: 4.7-10
  - 1 unit of regular insulin lowers glucose by 1.5 mmol
	- 1 unit/ml start at 0.1 unit/kg/hour then use below calculation.
	  - Units/h = (plasma glucose in mmol x 18) ÷ 150
		- Run with 5% dextrose solution (1 ml/kg/hour)
		  - *Why x 18. To convert mg/dL to mmol/l divide by 18*
			- *Consider adding KCl 20 mEq to each litre of maintenance fluid*
			  - *Measure glucose hourly*

# Cardiac

**CO =** SV (Preload x contractility x afterload) x HR  
**BP =** CO x SVR  
**MAP =** Diastolic + (Pulse pressure) ÷ 3  
**Target MAP:** Intracompartment pressure + Perfusion pressure
  - *Perfusion pressure (generally 50-60 mmHg)*
  - *Raised ICP: 20 (compartment) + 60 (PP) = 80-85 MAP*

**Laplace's law (Wall tension/Afterload):**
- Stress = (Pressure x Radius) ÷ 2(Thickness)
  - *Pressure refers to SVR*
**SVR =** 80 x (MAP - IVC) ÷ CO. 900-1200  
**Cardiac index =** CO ÷ TBSA. More than 2.5 l/min/m²  
**Coronary perfusion pressure:** Arterial diastolic pressure - Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)  

**CaO2:**
- (Hb x SO2 x 1.34) + (PaO2 x 0.003)

**DO2 (O2 delivery to tissues):**
- Dependent on respiratory and cardiovascular function. Arterial O2 content (CaO2) x CO. (Response cardiovascular system)

**EF:** SV ÷ End-diastolic volume  
**Stroke volume variation (fluid responsiveness):**
- SVV: SVmax - Smin ÷ SVmean
  - In ventilated patients: >15% likely responsive

**Pulse pressure variation:**
- PPV = (PPmax - PPmin) ÷ PPmean
  - In ventilated patients: >15% likely responsive
# Fluids and Blood

## Fluid Requirement

**Maintenance:**
- 4/2/1 rule
  - First 10 kg: 4 ml/kg/h
  - Second 10 kg: 2 ml/kg/h
  - Each kg above 20 kg: 1 ml/kg/h
  - If adult and above 20 kg: 60 + (weight - 20) = ml/h

**Pre-existing deficit:**
- Maintenance x hours fasted

**Surgical fluid losses (additional fluids required):**
- Minor operation: 0-2 ml/kg
- Moderate operation (open cholecystectomy): 2-4 ml/kg
- Severe operation (open bowel resection): 4-8 ml/kg
## Maximal Allowable Blood Loss (ABL)

**HB method:**
- ABL: (EBV x [(Hi - Hf) ÷ Hi])
  - EBV: estimated blood volume: body weight (kg) x average blood volume (ml/kg)
  - Hi: Initial HB
  - Hf: final hemoglobin (usually 7)
  - Blood volumes:
	- Premature: 95 ml/kg
	- Full-term neonate: 85 ml/kg
	- Kids average blood volume: 80 ml/kg
	- Adult male: 75 ml/kg
	- Adult female: 65 ml/kg

**HCT method:**
- Using HCT fall to 30%:
  - EBV (weights constant)
  - RBCV (EBV x RBCV %) - needs to be performed for both RBCV pre-op and RBCV 30% for below calculation.
  - RBCV lost = (RBCV pre-op - RBCV 30%) x 3
## Transfusion Rules of Thumb

- 1 U of RBC will increase HB by 1 and HCT by 2-3%
- 10 ml/kg of RBC will increase HB by 3 and HCT by 10%
- Transfusion volume: Hb x kg x 4 ml
## Infusion Rates (ml/hour)

- ml/min = Target infusion rate (ug/min) ÷ Drug concentration (ug/ml)
- ml/h = Above x 60
  - Example: Adrenaline 40 ug/ml @ 0.1 ug/kg/min for an 80 kg patient (8 ug/min)
	- (8 ug/min ÷ 40 ug/ml) = 0.2 ml/min x 60 = 12 ml/h
