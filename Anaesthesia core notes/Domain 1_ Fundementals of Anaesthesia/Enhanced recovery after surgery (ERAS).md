# ERAS Overview
- ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) is a system based on evidence-based interventions, assessed by measuring outcomes and improving compliance through feedback loops.
- It involves a team approach including surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses, hospital administrators, and funders.

## ERAS Guidelines for Perioperative Care

### Preoperative
- Preoperative preparation and counselling
- Curtailed fasting
- Preoperative supply of carbohydrate drinks
- No bowel preparation
- Prophylaxis of thromboembolic complications
- Antibiotic prophylaxis

### Intraoperative
- Preferences for laparoscopy or short transverse incisions
- Avoidance of post-operative drains
- Short-acting anaesthetics and analgesics
- Prevention of hypothermia
- Epidural anaesthesia
- Restricted sodium and fluids
- Prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting

### Postoperative
- Early removal of urinary catheter
- Non-opioid analgesics
- Stimulation of bowel motor activity
- No nasogastric tubes
- Early enteral nutrition
- Evaluation of treatment outcomes
- Surrogate markers for outcome:
  - Early recovery = Discharge from Recovery Room
  - Intermediate outcome = Days in hospital
  - Late outcome = Return to baseline function

## Role of Anaesthesiologist

### Anaesthetist’s Role in an ERAS Programme

#### Preoperative
- Pre-operative assessment clinics
- Cardio-pulmonary exercise testing
- Pre-habilitation
- Starvation

#### Intraoperative
- Goal-directed fluid therapy
  - Monitors
  - Fluids
- Analgesia
- Avoid hypothermia
- Anti-emesis
- DVT prophylaxis

#### Postoperative
- Managing:
  - Pain
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - DVT/early mobilization

### Preoperative Interventions

#### Pre-operative Assessment Clinics
- Established in many countries to risk stratify patients.
- Address co-morbidities through timely multidisciplinary discussion.

#### Cardio-pulmonary Exercise Testing
- Determine anaerobic threshold to risk stratify patients.
  - Consider alternatives (e.g., neoadjuvant radio/chemo therapy) if risks are high.
- Assess the effects of pre-habilitation and neoadjuvant therapy on cardiopulmonary reserve.

#### Starvation
- Avoid long starvation periods (not more than 8 hours).
- Provide clear fluids up to 2 hours pre-surgery.
- Offer carbohydrate-rich fluids to reduce insulin resistance.

### Intraoperative Interventions

#### Antibiotic Prophylaxis
- Single dose administration.

#### Avoid Hypothermia
- Decrease surgical site infection, coagulopathy, stress response, and cardiac morbidity.
- Maintain body temperature above 36°C using oesophageal temperature measurement and forced-air warmers.

#### Goal-Directed Fluid Therapy (GDFT)
- Context-sensitive fluid administration for optimal balance.
- Avoid too much or too little fluid to prevent gut ischaemia or delayed function and complications.
- Utilize noninvasive cardiac output monitors for targeting fluid administration.

**Evidence**:
- GDFT has shown benefits over standard treatment, especially in higher-risk patients or major surgeries.

#### Analgesia

##### Epidural
- Consider risks vs benefits for individual patients and surgery type.
  - Alternatives: paravertebral blocks, abdominal wall blocks (TAP, rectus sheath), wound infiltration catheters.

**Advantages**:
- Attenuates stress response, improves pulmonary and gut function, reduces thromboembolic events, and minimizes blood loss.

**Disadvantages**:
- Significant failure rate, hypotension, neurological injury, and resource intensiveness.

##### Systemic Drugs
- Paracetamol: IV preferred over oral; rectal is unpredictable.
- NSAIDs: Short-term use to reduce opiate requirements; cautious use in elderly and those with renal impairment.
- NMDA-R antagonists: Ketamine and magnesium for pain reduction.
- GABA analogues: Gabapentin or pregabalin preoperatively.
- Intravenous lignocaine: Reduces opioid requirement and postoperative complications.

**Procedure-specific Analgesia**:
- **Colorectal**: Thoracic epidural, TAP blocks, paracetamol, NSAIDs, ketamine.
- **Hepatobiliary (liver resection)**: Pregabalin/gabapentin, thoracic epidural, spinal morphine, subcostal TAP blocks.
- **Oesophagectomy**: Thoracic epidural or paravertebral block with catheter.
- **Major Gynaecological**: Epidural anaesthesia, spinal morphine, TAP blocks, LA infiltration with wound catheters.
- **Major Urological**: Pregabalin, thoracic epidural, intrathecal morphine, paracetamol, NSAIDs, ketamine.
- **Orthopaedics (Total Hip Replacement)**: Gabapentin, dexamethasone, ketamine, spinal morphine, paracetamol, oxycodone, tramadol, COX-2 inhibitors, fascia-iliaca block.
- **Total Knee Replacement**: Pregabalin, intrathecal morphine, NSAIDs, paracetamol, ketamine, periarticular injection, peripheral nerve blocks.

| **Preadmission education**                        | All patients undergoing major head and neck cancer surgery with free flap reconstruction should receive structured teaching from a qualified health practitioner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Low                                         | Strong                                         |
| **Perioperative nutritional care**                | Patients undergoing major surgery for head and neck cancer should undergo preoperative comprehensive nutritional assessment, with a special focus on dysphagia and risk for refeeding syndrome. Preoperative nutrition intervention is recommended for those at risk.                                                                                                                                            | High                                        | Strong                                         |
|                                                   | A standard polymeric enteral nutrition formula should be considered suitable for use in patients requiring perioperative nutrition support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Low                                         | Weak                                           |
|                                                   | A standard polymeric enteral nutrition formula should be used for oral intake and/or tube feeding in patients requiring perioperative nutrition support. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of other specialized formulas.                                                                                                                                                                        | Moderate                                    | Conditional                                    |
|                                                   | Preoperative screening and management for the risk of refeeding syndrome should be conducted for appropriate candidates. Fluids should be preferred for up to 2 hours prior to induction of anesthesia, and clear fluids up to 3 hours prior.                                                                                                                                                                    | High (fluids), Low (solids), Moderate (CHO) | Strong (fluids), Strong (solids), Strong (CHO) |
|                                                   | Oral diet is the first choice for all patients tolerating it. In patients for whom oral feeding cannot be established postoperatively tube feeding should be initiated within 24 hours. Nutrition interventions should be developed in consultation with the multidisciplinary team and individualized according to nutritional status and surgical procedure.                                                   | Moderate                                    | Strong                                         |
| **Prophylaxis against thromboembolism**           | All patients undergoing head and neck surgery with free flap reconstruction, are at increased risk of thromboembolism, and prophylaxis is recommended. The risk of bleeding must be weighed against the benefits on an individualized basis.                                                                                                                                                                     | High                                        | Strong                                         |
| **Antibiotic prophylaxis**                        | Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered for patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery with free flap reconstruction and should begin 1 hour prior to the procedure and continued for 24 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | High                                        | Strong                                         |
| **Postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis** | Patients undergoing major head and neck cancer surgery should receive preoperative and intraoperative prophylaxis against postoperative nausea and vomiting. A combination of agents targeting different pathways should be used.                                                                                                                                                                                | High                                        | Strong                                         |
| **Standard anesthetic protocol**                  | Local anesthetics should act synergistically, given intravenously and titrated to required effect. Postoperative and adjuvant analgesia should be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Low                                         | Strong                                         |
|                                                   | The anesthetic protocol should not only prevent awareness but also minimize adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, maintain metabolic and electrolyte balance, and prevent complications such as hypothermia.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Low                                         | Strong                                         |
| **Preventing hypothermia**                        | Normothermia should be maintained intraoperatively. Temperature monitoring is necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | High                                        | Strong                                         |
| **Perioperative fluid management**                | Intravenous fluids should be managed in a goal-directed manner, avoiding over and under hydration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Moderate                                    | Strong                                         |
| **Routine postoperative ICU admission**           | Routine intensive care unit admission to facilitate an immediate postoperative period of deep monitoring and the initiation of early physiotherapy is advised. For high-risk patients, ICU admission should be individualized according to the extent of surgery. A subset of patients may be monitored in an extended recovery unit or specialist ward providing adequate skilled nursing and medical coverage. | Low                                         | Weak                                           |
| **Pain management**                               | Multimodal analgesia, including NSAIDs, COX inhibitors, and paracetamol, are preferred for patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) should be used for immediate analgesia and as a bridge to oral analgesia.                                                                                                                                                        | High                                        | Strong                                         |
| **Postoperative flap monitoring**                 | Free flap monitoring should be performed at least hourly for the first 24 hours postoperatively. Monitoring should continue beyond this period as clinically indicated. Early signs of impending flap compromise should prompt immediate surgical intervention.
