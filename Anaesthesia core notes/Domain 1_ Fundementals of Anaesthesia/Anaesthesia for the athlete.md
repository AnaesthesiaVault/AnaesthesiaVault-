## Anabolic Steroids
- **Structure**: Similar to testosterone, enhancing male reproductive and secondary sex characteristics. Increase muscle mass and strength by encouraging new muscle and cell growth, allowing athletes to train harder and longer.
- **Complications**: Acne, feminization, virilisation. In men: impotence, infertility, gynaecomastia. In women: development of male characteristics.
- **Risks**: Cardiovascular changes (polycythaemia, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac muscle fibrosis), increased risk of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events, dependence, and 'roid rage.
### Anaesthetic Considerations
#### Induction
- Difficulties during bag-mask ventilation and intubation due to over-developed deltoids and neck muscles
- High O₂ consumption due to increased muscle mass resulting in rapid desaturation
- Reduced thoracic compliance due to muscle weight; intubation may be necessary as ventilation may be difficult
#### Maintenance
- Increased oxygen and anaesthetic agent requirements
- Resistance to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents due to increased nicotinic receptors
- Physiological bradycardia; prophylactic anticholinergic (e.g., glycopyrrolate) may be useful
- Renal clearance affected by excessive muscle mass, impacting drug metabolism
#### Extubation
- Risk of psychotic episodes on emergence; bite block advised
- Negative pressure pulmonary oedema risk if laryngospasm occurs
- Gentle and slow awakening recommended; clonidine may be used to ease emergence
#### Postoperative
- Analgesia requirements vary due to training-induced pain threshold changes or high endorphin levels
- VTE prophylaxis necessary due to polycythaemia
#### Practicalities
- Appropriately sized arterial pressure cuff and extra protection for pressure points
- DVT prophylaxis and manual handling considerations
- Monitor for hyperkalaemia after limb tourniquet deflation; treat with insulin dextrose, calcium, and fluids
## Peptide Hormones: Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin and Luteinizing Hormone
- Used with anabolic steroids to enhance muscle growth or counteract estrogen side-effects
- Increase testosterone and muscle growth in men; prevent testicular volume loss
- Minimal anaesthetic considerations
## Protein Hormones: Human Growth Hormone, Insulin-like Growth Factor, and Insulin
- Stimulate protein synthesis, bone growth, and reduce body fat
- Associated with acromegaly, organ enlargement, myopathies, hypothyroidism, cardiac disease, arthritis, diabetes mellitus, impotence, osteoporosis
- IGF-1 similar side effects with additional risk of hypoglycaemia from high-dose insulin
### Anaesthetic Considerations
- Complications similar to anabolic steroids
- Added acromegaly-related issues; check thyroid function tests and blood glucose preoperatively and monitor intraoperatively
## β2-Agonists: Terbutaline, Salbutamol, and Clenbuterol
- Improve muscle strength and endurance performance with long-term high-dose use
- Side effects: tachyarrhythmias, prolonged QT, hypokalaemia, lactic acidosis
### Anaesthetic Considerations
- Treat toxicity with IV fluids, β-blockers, potassium supplementation, and bicarbonate before induction
## Stimulants

### Amphetamines
- Release excitatory neurotransmitters, resulting in CNS stimulation, increased alertness, endurance, concentration, and sense of euphoria
- Short-term risks: hypertension, vomiting, abdominal pain, angina, cerebral haemorrhage, death, injury
- Long-term risks: facial dyskinesias, confusion, paranoia, insomnia, dependence, cross-tolerance
#### Anaesthetic Considerations
##### Preoperative
- Distinguish chronic and acute users; detailed history required
##### Intraoperative
- Acute use: increased anaesthetic requirements, potential for intraoperative intracranial hypertension
- Chronic use: decreased anaesthetic requirements due to CNS catecholamine depletion, risk of refractory hypotension, consider titrated induction, arterial line, direct-acting vasopressors
- Risk of serotonin syndrome; avoid droperidol, ondansetron, tramadol, use caution with other opioids
##### Postoperative
- Potential for unexpected/refractory hypotension and delayed serotonin syndrome development
### Caffeine
- Diuresis may mask other PED use; high doses in sports
- Risks: indigestion, diarrhoea, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension; fatal with other stimulants
## Increased Oxygen Delivery

### Recombinant Human Erythropoietin (rHuEPO)
- Popular with endurance athletes, increases RBC density and oxygen-carrying capacity
- Risks: increased Hct and blood viscosity, cardiovascular events, cerebral hypoxia, hypertension, hyperkalaemia, antibodies development, sudden death
### Anaesthetic Considerations
- Detailed history to identify complications
- Investigations: full blood count, electrolytes, ECG
- Ensure hydration and appropriate VTE prophylaxis
### Blood Doping
- Infusing whole blood to increase oxygen-carrying capacity
- Risks: viral infections, volume and iron overload

## Nutrition, Supplements, Protein Shakes
- High nitrogen load in protein shakes may strain clearance in impaired renal function

# ECG Findings in Athletes

### Normal ECG Findings
- Increased QRS voltage for LVH or RVH
- Incomplete RBBB
- Early repolarization/ST segment elevation
- ST elevation followed by T wave inversion V1-V4 in black athletes
- T wave inversion V1-V3 ≤ age 16 years old
- Sinus bradycardia or arrhythmia
- Ectopic atrial or junctional rhythm
- 1° AV block
- Mobitz Type I 2° AV block
### Borderline ECG Findings
- Left axis deviation
- Left atrial enlargement
- Right axis deviation
- Right atrial enlargement
- Complete RBBB
### Abnormal ECG Findings
- T wave inversion
- ST segment depression
- Pathologic Q waves
- Complete LBBB
- QRS ≥ 140 ms duration
- Epsilon wave
- Ventricular pre-excitation
- Prolonged QT interval
- Brugada Type 1 pattern
- Profound sinus bradycardia < 30 bpm
- PR interval ≥ 400 ms
- Mobitz Type II 2° AV block
- 3° AV block
- ≥ 2 PVCs
- Atrial tachyarrhythmias
- Ventricular arrhythmias
### Evaluation Recommendations
- **Normal ECG Findings**: No further evaluation required in asymptomatic athletes with no family history of inherited cardiac disease or SCD.
- **Borderline ECG Findings**: If in isolation, no further evaluation required. If two or more findings

, further evaluation required.

- **Abnormal ECG Findings**: Further evaluation required to investigate for pathologic cardiovascular disorders associated with SCD in athletes.

# Anaesthesia Choice

## Regional
- Neuraxial anaesthesia is relatively safe, but even minor, transient neuropraxias from nerve blocks can significantly affect an athlete's career.
## General Anaesthesia
- Limited data to guide choice between TIVA or volatiles; assessment should be clinical and anaesthetic familiar agents and analgesics should be used.
