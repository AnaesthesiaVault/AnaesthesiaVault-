## Perioperative Management Summary
### Rule of Thumbs

- To convert mg/dL to mmol/L, divide by 18.
- 10ml of 50% dextrose should raise glucose by 5
- 1 u of insulin should decrease glucose by 3 mmol
#### Insulin Sensitivity Factor

- In patients with T1DM, especially children, use their correction factor to manage hyperglycaemia in the perioperative period.
- If the correction factor (or insulin sensitivity factor) is unavailable, it can be calculated by dividing 100 by the patient’s total daily dose of insulin, which provides the expected glucose decrease in mmol/L per unit of insulin.
### Medication Adjustment

- Continue their metformin, GLP-1RA analogues, and DPP-4 inhibitors, including on the day of surgery.
	- Metformin only to be stopped on the day of surgery when if eGFR (<60 ml/min/1.73 m²)
#### Preoperative Insulin Adjustments

- **Fasting** reduces insulin requirements preoperatively.
- **Long-acting insulin analogues** should be reduced to **75–80%** of usual doses.
- **Intermediate-acting insulin** should be reduced by **50%**.

#### Transition to Intravenous Insulin

- For patients with T1DM or T2DM on insulin therapy, if the fasting period exceeds one missed meal or an insulin pump cannot be used, switch to intravenous (i.v.) insulin infusion
- In cases of emergency surgery or persistent hyperglycaemia, a variable-rate i.v. insulin infusion (VRIII) or combined glucose-insulin infusion is recommended.
- Ensure glucose infusion is administered alongside VRIII to prevent iatrogenic hypoglycaemia. This is typically due to continued insulin infusion without adequate glucose substrate.
### Intraoperative Insulin Management

- Target 6-10mmol:
- Check glucose every 12 hours
- Missed hypoglycaemic episodes are more harmful than hyperglycaemia. Thus, the lower glycaemic target range is increased to 5.6 mmol/L to prevent severe hypoglycaemia in fasting or sedated patients.
#### Hyperglycemia

- Treat intraoperative hyperglycaemia (glucose >10 mmol/L) with an i.v. insulin correction bolus (sliding scale) or adjust the VRIII.
- Don't bolus >6 units
- Insulin infusion 0.1unit/kg
- Run with 5% dextrose infusion (50g of glucose over 24 hours)- 5% dextrose at 40ml/hour
- Add 10mmol potassium for each 500ml dextrose given
- If glucose >12 mmol check for ketones
#### Hypoglycaemia Management

- Hypoglycaemia (glucose <5.6 mmol/L) in the perioperative or intensive care setting is typically iatrogenic and associated with poor outcomes.
- Treatment follows the 15-15 rule:
	1. Administer 15 g of i.v. glucose.
	2. Recheck glucose after 15 minutes.
- Never withhold insulin entirely in patients with T1DM or T2DM with high insulin dependency, as this may lead to insulin deficiency and ketoacidosis
### Other
- Dexamethasone is safe
- Consider MgS04 as adjunct

# Introduction

- **Prevalence and Impact**
	
	- The prevalence of DM is increasing. (10.5% world wide)
	- Worldwide, 537 million people have DM, and DM patients account for 17% of all operative procedures. 39% for Cardiovascular surgery
	- DM is the second most common perioperative comorbidity.
	- Studies have demonstrated that surgical patients with diabetes have a higher incidence of several complications, including:
		- Surgical site infections
		- Delayed wound healing
		- Cardiovascular events
		- Respiratory complications
- **Adverse Outcomes**
	
	- Adverse outcomes are related to:
		- Unpredictable preoperative fasting times.
		- Hazardous administration of intravenous medications, including insulin.
		- The stress response of surgery.
- **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) vs. T2DM**
	
	- If similar perioperative treatment is provided to both T1DM and T2DM patients, those with T1DM will have poorer glycaemic control.
	- T1DM patients have a higher perioperative peak glucose concentration and a higher incidence of perioperative hyperglycaemia compared to T2DM patients.

## Pathogenesis of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type I

1. **Genetic Susceptibility**

- IDDM1 (HLA) mutations
- IDDM2 (Insulin gene) mutations

1. **Failure of maturing T-cells** in the thymus to develop recognition of the insulin gene → abnormal attack of insulin-producing Beta-cells.
2. **Mutations in the HLA (MHC) gene** can either facilitate (or prevent) T-cell receptor binding to Beta-cells.
3. **Foreign antigens structurally mimic Beta-cell antigens** (molecular mimicry) → immune system attacks both these foreign and self-antigens.
2. **Environmental Triggers**

- **Diet**: cow's milk, nitrosamines
- **Viruses**: Rubella, Coxsackie, Mumps
- **Drugs/Toxins**: vacor, alloxa, streptozocin, pentamidine
- **Stresses**: repeated sicknesses, surgery, puberty
These factors can:
- Directly destroy or damage Beta cells, exposing its antigens to the body's immune system.

3. **Breakdown of Self-Tolerance and autoimmune destruction of B cells **

- Breakdown of immune system’s self-tolerance of pancreatic Beta-Cells.

4. **Progression**

- Pre-diabetes: Still asymptomatic, High post-prandial glucose, Blunted insulin response to IV glucose
- Type 1 diabetes: Over time, only <10% of original Beta cells are still functional, leading to primary absolute insulin deficit

## Pathogenesis of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II

1. **Unhealthy Lifestyle**

- Over-eating, obesity, inactivity.
- **Intra-peritoneal cavity accumulates visceral fat** ("abdominal fat"), which secretes:
	- Inflammatory mediators
	- Adipokines
	- Free fatty acids (FFAs)

2. **Genetic Susceptibility**

- Polygenic or monogenetic factors (e.g., MODY) can predispose insulin resistance.
- **Aging**: Decline in Beta-cell mass.
- **Medications**: Corticosteroids, antipsychotics, anti-retrovirals, progestin-only oral contraceptives.

3. **Insulin Resistance**

- Liver, muscle, adipose tissue become less responsive to insulin.
- Initially, Beta-cells work overtime to increase insulin secretion.

4. **Blood Glucose Regulation**

- Blood glucose is kept normal until insulin resistance worsens and Beta-cells tire out, leading to relative insulin deficiency.

5. **Lipotoxicity and Glucotoxicity**

- **Lipotoxicity**: FFAs inhibit GLUT2 function on Beta-cells.
- **Glucotoxicity**: Hyperglycemia is directly toxic to Beta-cells.

6. **Progression to Type II Diabetes Mellitus**

- Over many years, Beta-cells deteriorate leading to absolute insulin deficit.
- Body perceives a state of "starvation," mobilizing triglycerides into FFAs as fuel
# Classification of Diabetes

# Perioperative Management of Diabetes Mellitus
## Referral and Optimization
- Standardised referral form including:
  - HbA1c within 3 months of referral.
  - Control of co-morbidities.
  - All medications.
  - If >8.5%, refer for optimisation.

## Before Surgery
- Assess and optimise:
  - Diabetes.
  - Comorbidities.
- Ensure shared decision-making.
- Use surgery as a teachable moment:
  - Weight management.
  - Exercise.
  - Smoking cessation.

## On Admission
- Ensure medicines reconciliation.
- Use preoperative plan.
- Maintain CBG at 6-12 mmol/L.
- Document CBG, renal profile, lactate, and ketones in emergency patients.
- Ensure patients with T1DM are never denied insulin.
- If HbA1c > 8.5% refer for optimisation.
- Review for diabetes complications.
- Proper airway assessment.
- Review FBC, UCE, CMP, CXR, ECG, autonomic neuropathy, Echo.
- Patient to arrive for surgery with glucose 6-10 mmol/L.
### Review Medications
**Oral Medications:**
- Continue: Metformin, GLP-1RA analogues, and DPP-4 inhibitors.
- Omit due to risk of hypoglycaemia: Meglitinides & sulphonylureas.
- Omit due to risk of ketoacidosis/fluid loss/UTI: SGLT-2 inhibitors (gliflozins).

**Considerations:**
- GLP-1: Delayed gastric emptying–aspiration risk.
- Metformin: Risk of lactic acidosis; omit if risk of renal impairment (e.g., IV contrast).
- Major surgery with prolonged starvation: These drugs are typically stopped until the patient is eating and drinking; use a VRIII instead.

**Insulin:**
- Reduce long-acting insulin dose by 20-30% the day before and the day of surgery.
- Note: Type 1 diabetics always require insulin to prevent ketoacidosis.
  - Once daily dosing: Reduce by 20%.
  - Twice daily dosing: Reduce by 50%.
### Perioperative Modification of Insulin Therapy

| Insulin Regimen                                                      | Day Before Surgery                                       | Day of Surgery                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Once daily (evening dosing) intermediateor long-acting insulin** | Reduce dose by 20%                                       | Restart insulin with evening meal                                             |
| **Once daily (morning dosing) intermediateor long-acting insulin** | Usual dose                                               | Reduce dose by 20%                                                            |
| **Twice daily dosing**                                               | Usual dose                                               | Reduce morning dose to 50%<br>Normal evening dose with dinner                 |
| **Premixed insulin, or intermediateor long-acting insulin**        | Usual bolus doses<br>Reduce night-time basal dose by 20% | If basal dose in the morning, reduce by 20%<br>Omit bolus doses while fasting |
| **Basal-bolus regimen**                                              | Usual bolus doses                                        | Omit bolus doses while fasting                                                |

### Gastroparesis
- Due to autonomic neuropathy in the GI system.
- Approximately 50% of long-standing DM patients have delayed gastric emptying, not necessarily symptomatic.
- Consider the risk of aspiration and whether RSI is necessary.
  - Risk of aspiration is low, even in high-risk groups.
  - ESI or MSI may be more cardiovascularly stable.
  - Weigh the risk-benefit ratio.
## In Theatre
- Maintain glucose between 5-10 mmol/L.
- Use a dedicated IV line for insulin and dextrose.
- Insulin infusion: Add insulin to normal saline (1 unit/mL) and begin at 0.1 unit/kg/h.
  - Units of insulin per hour: Plasma glucose/8.
  - Use 5% dextrose in 0.45% NaCl and 0.2% KCl if on insulin infusion.
- Administer dexamethasone 4 mg if needed.
- Consider magnesium sulfate: 15 mg/kg/h.
- Monitor glucose hourly.
- Minimise starvation period.
- Aim for early DrEaMing (Drinking, Eating, and Mobilising).
- Clear diabetes management handover.

### Subcutaneous Insulin Pump
- Use basal rate only, no boluses.
- Change the cannula to a plastic one.
- Ensure it is inserted away from the surgical site.
- Hourly blood sugar level monitoring.
- If hypoglycaemia occurs, continue with the pump and administer glucose. Only stop if persistent hypoglycaemia occurs, then change to very low dose VRIII.
- Patients continue their pump in the perioperative period provided that they have a short fasting time. Pump setting to basal requirements during fasting.

**Contraindications:**
- Major surgery.
- Emergency surgery.
- Abdominal surgery with expected significant postoperative ileus.
- Prolonged starvation time (missing more than one meal).
- Procedures exposing the patient to ionizing radiation or electromagnetic fields.
### Safety of Hartmann’s Solution in DM
- Safe for use.
- Lactate in Hartmann’s solution (29 mmol) would yield 14.5 mmol of glucose at most.
- Distributed into extracellular fluid volume (12-15 litres in adults).
- Max increase in BSL = 1 mmol/L.
- In clinical practice, the effect on blood glucose is much less.
## On Return to the Ward
- Ensure medicines reconciliation.
- Encourage early DrEaMing.
- Protect pressure areas.
- Ensure patients with T1DM are never denied insulin.
- Maintain CBG at 6-12 mmol/L.
- Refer to diabetes specialist teams according to criteria.
## On Discharge
- Communicate with patients and GPs regarding:
  - All medication changes.
  - Plan for future diabetes care.
  - Importance of self-management.
## Hyperglycaemia Management

### BSL >12 mmol/L

- **Immediate Actions**
	
	- If insulin has been omitted, check for ketones.
- **Ketone Levels**
	
	- **Blood ketones:** If >3 mmol/L, or
	- **Urine ketones:** If >2+, suspect Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA).
- **DKA Protocol**
	
	- If ketone levels indicate DKA, follow the established DKA protocol.
- **Variable Rate Intravenous Insulin Infusion (VRIII)**
	
	- Start a VRIII if the patient is already in the theatre.
### Ensuring Insulin Administration

- Confirm that insulin is running.
- Verify the accuracy of measured glucose levels.

### Subcutaneous Rapid-Acting Insulin Administration

- **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)**
	
	- 1 unit of insulin can drop BSL by 3 mmol/L (greater sensitivity to insulin).
	- Check blood sugar hourly.
	- Consider a second dose only after 2 hours.
- **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)**
	
	- Use a sliding scale or administer a dose of 0.1 units/kg of insulin (maximum of 6 units).
	- Check blood sugar hourly.
	- Consider a second dose only after 2 hours.
	- Always ask for the patient’s advice regarding the dose.

### Deleterious Effects of Perioperative Hyperglycaemia (9-10 mmol/L)

- Enhanced inflammation and increased vulnerability to infection.
- Impaired endothelial nitric oxide (NO) generation.
- Increased expression of leukocyte and endothelial adhesion molecules.
- Decreased complement function.
- Impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis.
- Enhanced synthesis of inflammatory cytokines.

## Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia in the perioperative or intensive care setting (defined as glucose <5.6 mmol/L) is typically iatrogenic and is associated with poor outcomes

### Treatment Approach

Similar to outpatient management, the recommended treatment follows the **15-15 rule**:

1. Administer **15 g of intravenous glucose**.
2. **Recheck glucose levels** after **15 minutes**.
### Blood Sugar Levels and Treatment

- **Blood Sugar 4-6 mmol/L with Symptoms**
	
	- Consider administering 100 mL of 10% dextrose (or 20 mL of 50% dextrose).
- **Blood Sugar <4 mmol/L**
	
	- Administer 100 mL of 20% dextrose (or 40 mL of 50% dextrose).
- **Very Low Blood Sugars**
	
	- Less 2.8mmol
	- Release of epinephrine produces the systemic manifestations of hypoglycemia: diaphoresis, tachycardia, and nervousness.
	- IV of 50% glucose **(each 10ml of 50% glucose will raise the blood glucose of a 70-kg patient 1 mmol)**

## Regional Anaesthesia in DM Patients

- **Advantages of Regional Anaesthesia**
	- Avoidance of airway complications.
	- Attenuates the hyperglycaemic response to surgical stimuli.
	- Reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).
	- Earlier resumption of diet.
	- Decreased duration on insulin infusions.
	- Earlier mobilisation.
	- Opioid sparing effect.
	- Reduced length of hospital stay.
## Variable Rate Insulin Infusions (VRIII)

### Associated Risks

- **Hypoglycaemia and Mortality**
	- Hypoglycaemia and death have been associated with VRIII in the ICU trials VISEP and NICE-SUGAR.
- **Monitoring Issues*
	- Blood sugar level (BSL) readings are often not frequent enough.
- **Insulin Administration Challenges**
	- Delayed establishment or commencement of subcutaneous (SC) insulin after stopping VRIII can lead to complications.
- **Continued Use**
	- Despite its risks, VRIII continues to be used due to the lack of better alternatives.
### Complications

- **Hypoglycaemia or Hyperglycaemia**
	- Risk of hypoor hyperglycaemia if the insulin is mismanaged.
- **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)**
	- If insulin is stopped in a fasting type 1 patient, DKA can occur. It should be run at a very low dose with 100 mL of 20% dextrose to maintain appropriate blood sugar levels.
	- VRIII can be stopped if basal insulin has been administered.
- **Hyponatraemia**
	- This can occur if 5% dextrose is infused alongside VRIII.
- **Delay in Resuming Usual Diabetic Medications**
	- Usual diabetic medications should be started prior to stopping the infusion to avoid gaps in management.
- **Iatrogenic Complications**
	- Wrong dosing or incorrect pump settings can lead to severe complications.
#### Indications for VRIII

- **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) Patients Undergoing Surgery**
	- Starvation period greater than 1 missed meal.
	- Patients who have not received background insulin.
- **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) Patients Undergoing Surgery**
	- Starvation period greater than 1 missed meal and development of hyperglycaemia (CBG > 12 mmol/L).
- **Poorly Controlled Diabetes**
	- HbA1C > 69 mmol/mol (>8.5%).
- **Emergency Surgery**
	- Most diabetic patients requiring emergency surgery.
### Insulin Infusion Rates Based on Glucose Concentration

## Magnesium Sulphate

### Mechanisms for Reducing Intraoperative Hyperglycemia

- **Insulin Affinity**
	- Increases the affinity of insulin to its receptors.
- **Insulin Secretion**
	- Increases secretion of insulin by the pancreas.
- **Insulin-mediated Glucose Uptake**
	- Potentiates insulin-mediated glucose uptake.
- **Regulation of Glycogenolysis and Glucose Output**
	- Regulates glycogenolysis and glucose output in the liver.
- **Catabolic Hormones**
	- Decreases the release of catabolic hormones.
- **Glucose Translocation**
	- Regulates glucose translocation into cells.

### Evidence

- Administration of 15 mg/kg/h starting 20 minutes preoperatively.
- Patients receiving magnesium showed decreased blood glucose and insulin requirements.
- Mean blood glucose: 8.8 mmol/L (1.5) vs. 9.7 mmol/L (1.5) in the control group.
## Insulin

### Insulin Perioperative Management

#### Four Options

1. **Continuation of Normal Multiple Daily Injections (MDI)**
	- Administer at a reduced dose before surgery.
2. **Variable Rate Intravenous Insulin Infusion (VRIII)**
	- Adjust according to blood glucose measurements.
3. **Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII)**
	- Usually via a pump; continue in the perioperative period if fasting time is short.
4. **Fixed Rate Intravenous Insulin Infusion (FRIII)**
	- Typically used for Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA).

#### Guidelines for Preoperative Insulin Management

- **Long-acting Insulin**
	- Reduce the dose by 20-30% the day before and the day of surgery.
- **Premixed and Short-acting Insulin**
	- No dose adjustments usually required the day before surgery.
	- On the day of surgery, halve the dose of premixed insulins and withhold short-acting insulins if not eating.
- **Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII)**
	- Continue during the perioperative period with short fasting times.
- **Target Blood Glucose**
	- Aim for 6-10 mmol/L on arrival to the operating theatre.
# Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)

## Overview
- **Most common in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM)**
  - Triggered by infection or increased metabolic demand, leading to higher insulin requirements.
  - Results from an absolute insulin deficit where insulin is not produced or administered.

## Pathophysiology

### Insulin Deficit
- **Lack of insulin** results in:
  - **Suppressed lipolysis**: The body uses triglycerides for energy.
  - **Release of Free Fatty Acids (FFAs)** from adipose tissue.
  - **Ketogenesis** in the liver: FFAs are converted to ketone bodies (βOHB, AcAc).

### Hyperglycemia
- **Glucose remains in blood** as it is not utilized by muscle and fat cells.
- **Starved cells trigger**:
  - **Increased release of counter-regulatory hormones** Glucagon, Epinephrine, Cortisol, GH.
  - **Increased blood glucose** to facilitate cell glucose absorption.
  - **Enhanced gluconeogenesis & glycogenolysis** in the liver.
  - **Increased protein synthesis & proteolysis** in muscle.

### Glucosuria and Polyuria
- **If blood glucose >12 mmol/L**, it exceeds the renal threshold:
  - **Glucose filtration > reabsorption**, leading to glucosuria.
  - **Osmotic diuresis**: large-volume urine output.
  - **Polyuria**: results in severe dehydration.

## Clinical Manifestations

### Dehydration
- **Severe dehydration**:
  - Volume loss up to 4-5L.
  - Symptoms: ↓ JVP, orthostasis, postural hypotension, tachycardia, ↑ resting HR.

### Metabolic Acidosis
- **Increased anion gap**: keto-acids consume serum HCO₃⁻.
- **Acetyl Co-A**: used as energy by "starving" cells.
- **Ketone bodies**: acidic energy molecules.
  - **Ketonuria**: excretion of ketones in urine. High acetoacetate where alcoholic ketoacidosis has a disproportionate increase in β-hydroxybutyrate.
  - **Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting**: due to enteric nervous system disruption.
  - **Kussmaul respiration**: deep, fast breathing to offset acidosis.
  - **Ketone breath**: fruity odor.
  - **Neurological symptoms**: confusion, weakness, possible coma.
## Common Causes
- Infection, trauma, intoxication (cocaine), pancreatitis, acute coronary syndrome, medication noncompliance (insulin).
## Diagnosis
- Glucose > 14 mmol/L
- HCO3 < 18 mmol/L
- pH < 7.3
- Ketones in urine/blood
## Treatment
1. **Fluids**: Rehydration.
2. **Insulin + KCl**: Correct hyperglycemia and prevent hypokalemia.
3. **Follow anion gap** until closure.
4. **Identify and treat precipitant**.
5. **Correct low PO4**: Often occurs a few days after DKA resolution due to ATP production.
## Considerations
- Life-threatening anion gap metabolic acidosis (ketoacidosis)
- CNS: ↓ LOC (hypovolemia, cerebral edema)
- Cardiovascular: cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure
- Hyperventilation: very high minute ventilation, caution with intubation & positive pressure ventilation
- Hypovolemia: Osmotic diuresis (hyperglycemia)
- Electrolyte abnormalities: Hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia (factitious hyponatremia)
- Consequences of therapy: Electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia/hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia), hypoglycemia, cerebral edema, central pontine myelinolysis.
## Crises
- Electrolyte abnormalities (hyperkalemia/hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia)
- Hypoglycemia
- Cerebral edema (glucose correction without correcting hyponatremia)
- Central pontine myelinolysis (rapid serum sodium correction)

## Management
1. **Goals**:
  - Normal anion gap (AG)
  - pH > 7.2
  - Potassium > 3.5 mmol/L
  - Bicarbonate > 20 mmol/L
  - Glucose < 13 mmol/L
  - Urine output 1 ml/kg/hr

2. **Volume Replacement**:
  - Normal saline to correct hypovolemia (3-5L deficit)
  - Then slow to maintenance (up to 500ml/hr)
  - Change to D5NS when glucose < 14 mmol/L
  - Add potassium to IV fluids once < 4.5 mmol/L and urinating

3. **Insulin Replacement**:
  - Goal for decreasing blood glucose in ketoacidosis should be 5.5 mmol/h or less or 10%/h or less with an IV insulin infusion starting at 0.1 units/kg/h.
  - DO NOT start insulin if potassium < 3.3 mmol/L.
  - Glucose goal 10-15 mmol/L.
  - When glucose < 14 mmol/L: add D5W to solution.

4. **Potassium Management**:
  - If < 3.3 mmol/L: DO NOT start insulin, give 20-30 mEq/hr of potassium until K > 3.3 mmol/L.
  - If > 3.3 mmol/L and < 5.3 mmol/L: give potassium 20 mEq/L of fluid.
  - If > 5.3 mmol/L: Do NOT give potassium.

5. **Frequent Monitoring**:
  - ABG, electrolytes (AG), BUN, creatinine, osmolality, plasma & urinary ketones, magnesium, phosphate, lactate.

6. **Consider Sodium Bicarbonate**:
  - If pH < 7 and there is myocardial dysfunction, vasodilation, or life-threatening hyperkalemia.

# Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS)

## Overview
- HHS is only seen in Type II DM patients.
- Always look for an underlying cause (e.g., infection).

## Pathophysiology

### Relative Insulin Deficit
- **Inadequate insulin production, insulin resistance, or non-adherence to insulin therapy.**
- **Stresses increasing insulin demand**: infections, pneumonia, MI, pancreatitis.
- **Some insulin is present**, allowing some glucose utilization by muscle and fat cells, but leaving high blood glucose levels.

### Hyperglycemia
- **Very high blood glucose**, higher than in DKA.
- **When blood glucose >12 mmol/L**, glucose filtration exceeds reabsorption, leading to glucosuria.
- **Glucosuria**: glucose in filtrate promotes osmotic diuresis, resulting in large-volume urine output.

### Polyuria and Dehydration
- **Polyuria**: leads to severe dehydration.
- **Dehydration symptoms**: ↓ JVP, orthostasis, postural hypotension, postural tachycardia, ↑ resting HR.
- **Electrolyte imbalance**: due to altered total body water and ion osmosis.
## Metabolic Changes

### Catabolic Hormones and Energy Needs
- **Cells not "starved" but need more energy**:
  - ↑ Release of catabolic hormones (Glucagon, Epinephrine, Cortisol, GH).
  - **Body increases blood glucose** to enhance cell glucose absorption.
  - **Enhanced gluconeogenesis & glycogenolysis** in the liver.
  - **Increased protein synthesis & proteolysis** in muscle.

### Polyphagia
- **Hypothalamic cells sense low intracellular glucose**, triggering feelings of hunger.

### Absence of Ketogenesis
- **Presence of some insulin inhibits lipolysis**, preventing ketone body production, metabolic acidosis, and ketonuria (unlike in DKA).
- **If ketones are detected** in HHS, they are likely secondary to starvation or other mechanisms.
## Complications

### Dehydration and Polydipsia
- **Severe dehydration**:
  - If the patient doesn’t drink enough water to replenish lost blood volume.
  - If the patient is alert and water is accessible, polydipsia occurs.

### Osmotic Imbalance and Neural Damage
- **Increased ECF osmolarity** (hypernatremia):
  - Water leaves neurons osmotically, shrinking them.
  - Neural damage: delirium, lethargy, seizure, stupor, coma.

### Renal Failure
- **Decreased renal perfusion** leading to reduced GFR and pre-renal failure.
- **Electrolyte imbalances** (hyperkalemia, hypernatremia) are worsened by acute renal failure, commonly coexisting with DKA/HHS.

## Important Notes
- **Potassium Loss**:
  - Body K⁺ is lost via osmotic diuresis.
  - Serum K⁺ may appear normal/elevated due to diffusion of K⁺ out of cells.
  - Prevent hypokalemia by administering IV KCl with IV insulin as soon as serum K⁺ <5.0 mmol/L. Ensure good renal function/urine output to avoid hyperkalemia.
- Common in type 2 DM.
- Ketoacidosis is not a feature of hyperosmolar nonketotic coma (enough insulin is available to prevent ketone body formation).
- Hyperglycemia-induced diuresis leads to dehydration and hyperosmolality and may ultimately lead to kidney failure, lactic acidosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
- Hyperosmolality (frequently exceeding 360 mOsm/L) dehydrates neurons, causing altered mental status and seizures.
- Severe hyperglycemia causes factitious hyponatremia: each 5.5 mmol/L increase in plasma glucose lowers plasma sodium concentration by 1.6 mEq/L.
# Insulinoma

## Preoperative and Intraoperative Management

- **Blood Sugar Levels**
	
	- Maintain normal blood sugar levels preoperatively and intraoperatively.
	- Tumor manipulation can cause profound hypoglycemia; inquire about the patient's symptomatic blood sugar level threshold.
	- Post-resection may lead to hyperglycemia.
- **Monitoring**
	
	- Use an arterial line (A-line) for regular blood sugar monitoring.
- **Cerebral Metabolic Rate**
	
	- Decrease the cerebral metabolic rate to limit damage from hypoglycemic episodes.
