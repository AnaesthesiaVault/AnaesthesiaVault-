# Altitude Physiology

## Alveolar Gas Equation: Why a Climber May Collapse at High Altitude

The alveolar gas equation explains the relationship between inspired oxygen, alveolar oxygen, carbon dioxide, and barometric pressure: PAO2=PIO2−PaCO2/R

Where:

- PAO2 is the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen
- PIO is the partial pressure of inspired oxygen
- PaCO2​ is the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide
- R is the respiratory exchange ratio (typically 0.8)

At high altitudes, barometric pressure (PB) decreases significantly, leading to a decrease in PIO2​. This results in lower PAO2​ and consequently lower PaO2causing hypoxaemic hypoxia. This hypoxia can lead to symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, and collapse.

## Calculation of PAO2 at High Altitude

To calculate PAO2 at an altitude where the barometric pressure (PB) is 600 mmHg, with a PaCO2 of 40 mmHg and an FiO2​ of 40%, use the following steps:

### Step 1: Calculate PIO2

PIO2=FiO2×(PB−PSVPwater)

Assuming PSVP water is 47 mmHg (standard value), PIO2=0.4×(600−47)=0.4×553=221.2 mmHg

### Step 2: Calculate PAO2

PAO2=PIO2−PaCO2/R

R=0.8R

PAO2=221.2−{40/8)=221.2−50=171.2 mm

## Physiology of the Ventilatory Response to Increasing Altitude

- **Decrease in Patm** → Decrease in PAO2→ Hypoxia → Stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors (more sensitive when acclimatized) → Hyperventilation.
- **Initial inhibition** by resultant decrease in PCO2​ (central and peripheral chemoreceptors) and alkalosis (peripheral only). This inhibition is compensated by CSF ejection and renal excretion of HCO₃⁻ within 2-3 days, removing the inhibition.

## Beneficial and Harmful Physiological Changes from Hypoxia at High Altitude

### Beneficial

1. **Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve (OHDC) Shift**:
	- Moderate altitude: Respiratory alkalosis increases 2,3-DPG → Rightward shift → Better O₂ offloading.
	- High altitude: Severe respiratory alkalosis shifts the curve left → Better O₂ onloading.
2. **Increased Peripheral Capillaries**: More capillaries per unit volume.
3. **Efficient Intracellular Oxidative Enzymes**.
4. **Increased Maximum Breathing Capacity**: Due to less dense air.

### Intermediate

5. **Polycythemia**: Hypoxia stimulates renal erythropoietin release.
	- Beneficial: Increased O₂ carrying capacity.
	- Harmful: Increased blood viscosity.

### Harmful

6. **Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPVC)**: Increases pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) → Increased right heart workload → Hypertrophy.
7. **Pulmonary Hypertension**: Can lead to pulmonary edema.
8. **Chronic Mountain Sickness**: Severe polycythemia, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and severe hypoxemia.

## Effects of High Altitude on the Provision of Anaesthesia

### Volatile Anesthetics

1. **Variable-Bypass Vaporizers (VBVs)**: Unaffected by altitude as they output the same partial pressure for a given percentage, though the percentage differs.
2. **Dual Circuit Vaporizers (e.g., Desflurane)**: Must be set higher at higher altitudes due to the lower Patm.
3. **Map (Minimum Alveolar Partial Pressure)**: Unaffected, but MAC (Minimum Alveolar Concentration) changes inversely with altitude.
4. **Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)**: Decreases in effect with increasing altitude.

### Gas Exchange

- At high altitudes, 21% O₂ may be hypoxic due to reduced atmospheric pressure. A minimum of 20.9 kPa of O₂ is required for a reliable P/F ratio.

### Equipment Considerations

- **Flow Meters**: May be inaccurate and require recalibration.

## Equivalent Values of MAC and Map at Various Barometric Pressures

### MAC (Minimum Alveolar Concentration)

|**Agent**|**Sea Level**|**5000 ft**|**10 000 ft**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Nitrous Oxide|101.5|126.5|152.2|
|Halothane|0.75|0.9|1.09|
|Isoflurane|1.2|1.45|1.73|
|Sevoflurane|2.0|2.4|3.2|
|Desflurane|6.0|7.25|9.6|

### Map (Minimum Alveolar Partial Pressure)

|**kPa**|**mm Hg**|
|---|---|
|106.1|798|
|0.76|5.7|
|1.22|9.1|
|2.12|15.9|
|6.36|47.7|

**Note:** Map remains unaffected while MAC is proportional to Patm.

### Effect of Altitude on Vaporizer Output

- **Variable-Bypass Vaporizers**: Altitude has no effect since the splitting ratio is based on temperature-dependent saturated vapor pressure (SVP), unaffected by barometric pressure.
- **Dual Circuit Vaporizers**: Must be adjusted for higher settings at higher altitudes due to the lower Patm decreasing the partial pressure of the vapor released.

### MAC and Map Values for Isoflurane and Sevoflurane

- **MAC (new)** = MAC (original) × 101.3 / Patm.
- **Map** remains constant at MACoriginal×101.3 kPaMAC_{original} \times 101.3 \, kPaMACoriginal​×101.3kPa (e.g., 1.22 kPa for Isoflurane).

## Consequences of Acute Exposure to High Altitude

|**Altitude**|**High Altitude (1 500 - 3 500 m)**|**Very High Altitude (3 500 - 5 500 m)**|**Extreme Altitude (5 500 - 8 850 m)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**HAI Occurrence**|Rapid ascent above 2 500 m|Most common range for HAI (AMS, HAPE, Have)|Abrupt ascent always causes severe HAI|
|**Exercise Performance**|Decrease|Requires acclimatisation for physical effort|Progressive physiological deterioration outstrips acclimatisation|
|**Ventilation**|Increase|||
|**SpO2**|Minor decrease (usually ≥90%)|75% - 85%|55% - 75%; severe hypocarbia|
|**PaO2**|7 - 10 kPa|5 - 8 kPa|3.5 - 5 kPa|
|**Severe Hypoxia**|Unlikely in absence of underlying illness or HAPE|Extreme hypoxia during sleep, exercise, or illness|Always requires acclimatisation to avoid illness|

**Abbreviations:**

- HAI = high-altitude illness
- AMS = acute mountain sickness
- HAPE = high-altitude pulmonary oedema
- Have = high-altitude cerebral oedema
