# Anaesthesia and Cancer

## Anaesthetic Factors Influencing Recurrence

### Potential Carcinogenic and Anti-Carcinogenic Effects of Anesthesia and Surgery

#### Potential Carcinogenic Effects
- **Surgical Stress**: Induces immunosuppression, inflammatory mediators, angiogenesis, and growth factors.
- **Opioids**: May enhance immunosuppression and inflammatory responses.
- **Inhalational Agents**: Potentially promote pro-carcinogenic effects through immunosuppression.
- **Steroids**: Effects on carcinogenesis are uncertain.

#### Potential Anti-Carcinogenic Effects
- **Regional Anesthesia and Local Anesthetics**: Reduce surgical stress and may have direct anti-tumor effects.
- **Propofol (TIVA)**: Demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties.
- **NSAIDs**: Reduce immunosuppression and inflammatory responses.

#### Surgical Stress Pathway
- Leads to immunosuppression, inflammation, angiogenesis, and growth factors which promote the growth of residual cancer cells and a pro-metastatic environment.

### Regional Anesthesia and Local Anesthetics

- **Theoretical Benefits**: Reduction in perioperative opioids, attenuation of stress response, maintenance of host immunity, and direct anti-tumor effects.
- **Evidence from Studies**: Demonstrated reduced metastases in animals; immunomodulatory effects of local anesthetics.
- **Clinical Impact**: Prolonged disease-free survival in various cancers (breast, prostate, colorectal, ovarian, head, and neck).

### NSAIDs

- **COX-2 Expression**: Elevated in various cancers.
- **Epidemiological Evidence**: Reduction in relative risk for several cancers (colon, breast, lung, prostate).
- **Subgroup Analyses**: Significant risk reduction with selective COX-2 inhibitors.
- **Meta-Analyses**: Aspirin use associated with reduced breast cancer risk.
- **Prospective Cohort Studies**: NSAID use linked with reduced risk of colonic adenocarcinoma.

### Inhalational vs. TIVA - Evidence

- **Largest Series**: >7000 patients, showing higher survival in TIVA group.
- **Retrospective Analyses**: Better survival rates with TIVA in breast and colorectal tumors.
- **Mastectomy Study**: Significant reduction in breast cancer recurrence with TIVA.

### General Controversies

**Inhalational vs TIVA**
- Still under investigation but the overall signal suggests that TIVA may reduce cancer recurrence.

**Regional/Neuraxial**
- Initially thought to reduce recurrence but recent large prospective study on paravertebral blocks in breast cancer shows no benefit.

**NSAIDs**
- Protective against cancer (especially gastrointestinal).

**Opioids**
- Associated with cancer recurrence due to immunosuppression, but can also reduce surgical stress response which is anti-carcinogenic.

## Perioperative Issues

### Preoperative

- **History**: Focus on nutrition, comorbidities, morbidity of the disease, and goal of surgery.
- **Examination**: Focus on systemic effects of cancer and treatments.
- **Investigations**: FBC, UE, LFT, coags, ECG.
- **Optimization**: Nutrition, anemia, hydration, electrolytes, endocrine (DM/DI/Thyroid/Ca²⁺/Adrenal/Pituitary) versus time-sensitivity of surgery.
- **Chemotherapy Review**:
  - Epirubicin: Cardiac toxicity (impaired LV systolic function).
  - Cisplatin: Nephrotoxicity.
  - Fluorouracil: Fatty liver, angina, mucositis.
  - Hematological Side Effects: Thrombocytopenia.

### Intraoperative

- **Airway Management**: ATI vs. awake tracheostomy.
- **Drug Choices**:
- **Blood Management**: CMV risk, transfusion trigger 6-8 g/dL if otherwise well, consider platelets.
- **Anesthesia**: Regional anesthesia and TIVA may reduce recurrence.

### Postoperative

- **Drug Tolerance and Disordered Nociception**:
  - Convert patient’s opioids to parenteral dose per hour.
  - Continue peri-operatively +30% for postoperative pain.

### Drug Choices

**Sedatives**

## Tumor Lysis Syndrome

### Pathways

- Increased potassium, purine nucleic acids, phosphorus, decreased calcium.

### Consequences

- Cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, neurological disturbances.

### Considerations

- Tumor lysis syndrome is a group of metabolic abnormalities that can occur as a complication during the treatment of cancer, where large amounts of tumor cells are lysed simultaneously by the treatment, releasing their contents into the bloodstream.
- Severe acute life-threatening condition with potential for multi-system failure:
  - Hyperkalemia and secondary arrhythmias.
  - Hyperuricemia and acute renal failure.
  - Hypocalcemia and risk of seizures, tetany.
  - Hyperphosphatemia and prolonged QT interval.

### Criteria for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (Cairo-Bishop)

- **Laboratory TLS**: Elevated uric acid, potassium, phosphorus, decreased calcium.
- **Clinical TLS**: Laboratory TLS plus acute kidney injury, seizure, arrhythmia, sudden death.

### Influence of Anesthesia on Cancer Recurrence and Metastasis

- **Factors**: Stress, HPA stimulation, inhaled anesthetics, opioids, inflammation.
- **Impact**: Immunosuppression, angiogenesis, metastasis promotion.
- **Drugs**: NSAIDs, propofol, regional anesthesia shown to reduce adverse outcomes.

### Treatment

- Admission to a high-acuity setting.
- Rapid diagnosis and treatment of metabolic derangements.
- Prevent and support renal failure:
  - Volume loading (20 mL/kg) and 1.5-2 times maintenance.
  - If volume overloaded, consider diuretics and potentially dialysis.
- Acute treatment of hyperkalemia and life-threatening arrhythmias.
- Rasburicase/allopurinol for hyperuricemia.

# Anaesthesia Influence on Cancer Recurrence
## Influence of Anesthesia on Cancer Recurrence

#### Factors Affecting Recurrence and Metastasis
- **Stress and HPA Stimulation**: Induced by surgical stress, inhaled anesthetics, opioids, hypothermia, inflammation, and catecholamines.
- **Immunosuppression**: Suppression due to perioperative factors and drugs (opioids, catecholamines, PG).
- **Angiogenesis and VEGF**: Promoted by surgical stress and inflammatory mediators.
- **Inhibition Mechanisms**: Implemented by regional anesthesia, local anesthetics, naltrexone, β-blockers, COX-inhibitors.
- **Proliferation, Recurrence, Metastasis**: Driven by stress, pain, hypothermia, and inflammation. Inhibited by appropriate anesthetic and pharmacological strategies.
- **Invasivity**: Enhanced by surgical and anesthetic factors, requiring careful management.

## Perioperative Phenomena Influencing Cancer Recurrence and Survival

### Surgery
- **Immunosuppression**: Surgery can cause immunosuppression, enabling tumor cell adhesion and increasing the release of metalloproteinases and VEGF.
- **Cancer Progression**: Promotes cancer progression, metastatic recurrence, and increases the motility/invasiveness of cancer cells.
- **Pain Management**: Relief of cancer and perioperative pain inhibits tumor growth and metastasis.

### Inflammation
- **Angiogenesis**: Inflammation produces angiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors, cytokines, and proteases that promote neoplastic progression.
- **NSAIDs**: Reduce immunosuppression and tumor progression.

### Opioids
- **Immunosuppression**: Perioperative morphine induces immunosuppression. Hydromorphone, oxycodone, and buprenorphine have lower immunosuppressive activity.
- **Proangiogenic Effect**: Opioids have a proangiogenic effect.
- **Methyl naltrexone**: Inhibits angiogenesis and immune response, reduces tumor growth and lung metastasis in mice.
- **More Expression**: Higher More expression and opioid dose requirement are associated with shorter survival.

### Anesthesia
- **General Anesthetics**: Some (e.g., ketamine, thiopental, halothane) suppress NK cell activity and increase metastases.
- **Inhaled Anesthetics**: Up-regulate HIF, facilitating cancer spread and contributing to recurrence.
- **Propofol**: Better than inhaled anesthesia in terms of immunity, induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
- **Combined Anesthesia**: General anesthesia combined with regional anesthesia/analgesia improves immune outcomes and reduces metastatic burden.
- **Epidural Anesthesia**: Some studies show controversial results regarding survival.
- **Clinical Trials**: Ongoing trials investigating regional anesthesia influence on tumor outcomes.

## Local Anesthetics Effects on Cancer Cells

- **Pain Management**: Improve immediate postoperative pain and reduce surgery-induced immune alterations.
- **Calcium Levels**: Produce changes in intracellular calcium levels, inducing free radical production and apoptosis pathways (dibucaine).
- **Cell Proliferation**: Up-regulate RASSF1A expression, inhibiting cell proliferation (procaine).
- **PI3K/Akt Pathway**: Activate the pathway, inhibiting metastasis (bupivacaine).
- **Kinesin Motility**: Inhibit kinesin motility and microtubule protrusion, decreasing metastasis (tetracaine).
- **DNA Demethylation**: Lidocaine and procaine demethylate DNA, exerting tumor-suppressive effects.
- **EGFR Activity**: Lidocaine inhibits EGFR activity.
- **VGSC**: Inhibit VGSC, decreasing cell proliferation/invasiveness and angiogenesis.
- **TNF-α**: Inhibit TNF-α.
- **Wingless-type Pathway**: Reactivate the inhibitor factor 1 and down-regulate the pathway, suggesting antiproliferative effects (procaine, procainamide).
- **Mesenchymal Stem Cells**: Promote antiproliferative effects (ropivacaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine).
- **Cellular Membrane**: Interact on cellular membranes, including receptors and second messengers.
