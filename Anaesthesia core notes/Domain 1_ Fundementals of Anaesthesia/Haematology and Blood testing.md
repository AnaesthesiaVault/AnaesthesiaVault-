## Anaemia: Definition, Prevalence, and Classification

### Definition
- **WHO Definition**: Anaemia is characterized by a reduction in the number of red blood cells (RBCs) and their oxygen-carrying capacity, falling short of the body's physiological needs. It is quantified by a haemoglobin concentration of:
  - **Men**: Less than 130 g/dL
  - **Non-pregnant women**: Less than 120 g/dL

### Prevalence
- **Preoperative Anaemia**: Up to 60% of patients may present with anaemia before surgery.

### Perioperative Complications
- **Associated Risks**: Perioperative anaemia is linked with various complications and increased morbidity and mortality (M&M).

### Common Perioperative Causes
1. **Nutritional Deficiencies**:
   - **Iron Deficiency**:
	 - **Marker**: Serum Ferritin (most sensitive)
	 - **Presentation**: Microcytic hypochromic (in late stages)
2. **Inflammation**
3. **Chronic Underlying Disorders**:
   - Examples include cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and menorrhagia.
4. **Surgical Blood Loss**

### Classification of Anaemia

#### Based on Mechanism
1. **Decreased Production**
2. **Increased Destruction (Hemolysis)**
3. **Blood Loss**

#### Based on Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
1. **Microcytic Anaemia**
   - Example: Iron-deficiency anaemia
2. **Normocytic Anaemia**
   - Examples:
	 1. Blood loss
	 2. Hemolysis
	 3. Anaemia of chronic disease
	 4. Marrow failure
3. **Macrocytic Anaemia**
   - Examples: Vitamin B12/folate deficiency, Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
## Types of Anaemia and Associated Laboratory Findings

| Type of Anaemia            | Serum Iron | Transferrin | % Saturation of Transferrin | Serum Ferritin | Marrow Iron |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Iron deficiency anaemia    | Decreased  | Decreased   | Decreased                   | Decreased      | Decreased   |
| Anaemia of chronic disease | N to ↓     | N to ↑      | N to ↓                      | Unchanged      | Unchanged   |
| Thalassaemia major         | Increased  | Unchanged   | Unchanged                   | Increased      | Increased   |

## Effects and Compensation of Anaemia

### Physiological Effect of Anaemia
- **Equation for Oxygen Delivery (DO₂)**:
D02= CO x (Ca02 + Pa02)
- **Process**:
  - Decrease in haemoglobin (Hb) leads to a decrease in oxygen (O₂) carrying capacity, resulting in reduced oxygen delivery (DO₂).
  - This triggers compensatory mechanisms to maintain oxygenation.
  - If compensation is insufficient, hypoxia ensues, leading to organ dysfunction.

### Adaptation to Anaemia
- **Non-Hemodynamic Adaptations**:
  - **Increased Erythropoietin (EPO)**: Stimulated by hypoxia.
  - **Increased Oxygen Extraction**:
	- Decreased Hb-O₂ affinity.
	- Rightward shift of the Oxygen-Haemoglobin Dissociation Curve (OHDC).
	- Increased 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels.
- **Hemodynamic Adaptations**:
  - **Decreased Afterload (AL)**:
	- Decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR).
	- Reduced blood viscosity and vasodilation (mediated by endothelial nitric oxide (NO) and hypoxic metabolites).
  - **Increased Preload (PL)**:
	- Enhanced venous return due to venoconstriction mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).
  - **Increased Myocardial Contractility (MC)**:
	- Augmented preload (Frank-Starling mechanism) and SNS stimulation.
  - **Increased Cardiac Output (CO)**: Result of the combined hemodynamic adaptations.

## Tests for Anaemia

### Ferritin
- **Role**: Intracellular storage form of iron.
- **Clinical Note**: Ferritin is an acute phase protein and can appear falsely high or normal in cases of inflammation, liver disease, or malignancy.

### Serum Iron
- **Definition**: Ferric ions bound to serum transferrin.

### Transferrin/Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC)
- **Role**: Main iron transport protein in the blood.
- **Clinical Note**: Increases in iron deficiency anaemia to maximize utilization of available iron.

### Transferrin Saturation
- **Definition**: Measure of how saturated transferrin is with iron.
- **Normal**: 30%.
- **Iron Deficiency Anaemia**: <20%.
- **Iron Overload**: >50%.

## Goals & Management

### Patient Blood Management

#### Preoperative Period

##### Detection of Anaemia
- **History**: Include bleeding history and co-morbid diseases.
- **Investigations**: Complete blood count (CBC), coagulation studies, and iron studies as indicated.

##### Management of Preexisting Anaemia
- **Optimization**:
  - Delay surgery if possible to optimize preoperatively.
  - **Iron Supplementation**: Oral or intravenous (IV). IV is preferred if there is intolerance to oral iron, poor gastrointestinal (GI) uptake, or a short preoperative timeline.
  - **Vitamin B12/Folate**: Supplementation as needed.
  - **Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents**: Consider for stimulating red blood cell production.
  - **Hematology Referral**: As needed for specialized management.

##### Tests
- Full blood count.
- Serum ferritin.
- Transferrin saturation.
- Vitamin B12 levels.
- Folate levels.
- Marker of inflammation (e.g., serum C-reactive protein).
- Renal function tests (e.g., serum creatinine).

## Treatment Algorithm for Pre-operative Anaemia

1. **Surgical Listing**: Expected > 500 ml blood loss or transfusion risk >10%
2. **Anaemia Detection**: Hb <130 g·L⁻¹
3. **Further Laboratory Testing**: Serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, vitamin B12, folate, C-reactive protein, creatinine

#### Ferritin less than 30 mg·L⁻¹

- Iron deficiency anaemia
	- **Timing of Surgery Not Critical (>6 weeks)**:
		- Oral iron
		- Check Hb after 4 weeks; if still anaemic (Hb <130 g·L⁻¹), give i.v. iron
	- **Intravenous Iron**
	- Assess for source of blood loss and refer as appropriate or refer to GI if no obvious source:
		- Adult male
		- Post-menopausal female
		- Premenopausal female with GI symptoms

#### Ferritin 30–100 mg·L⁻¹ + Transferrin Saturation < 20% or C-reactive Protein > 5 mg·L⁻¹

- Anaemia of chronic inflammation with iron deficiency
	- **Timing Critical or One of Following**:
		- Poor oral iron tolerance/non-compliance
		- Impaired GI absorption
		- Haemodialysis
	- **Intravenous Iron**

#### Ferritin >100 mg·L⁻¹ + Transferrin Saturation < 20% or C-reactive Protein > 5 mg·L⁻¹

- Anaemia of chronic inflammation
	- **Intravenous Iron**

#### Ferritin >100 mg·L⁻¹ + Transferrin Saturation > 20%

- Consider and refer as appropriate:
	- Non-haematological cause:
		- Acute/chronic inflammation
		- Chronic infection
		- Malignancy
		- Liver disease
		- Renal failure
	- Haematological cause:
		- Haemoglobinopathy e.g. Thalassaemia trait
		- Sideroblastic anaemia

#### Vitamin B12 and/or Folate Low

- Vitamin B12 and/or Folate Therapy

#### Serum Creatinine Abnormal

- Chronic Kidney Disease
- Refer to Nephrologist
Simplified:
1. **Low ferritin** => Fe deficiency -> give oral iron if non urgent -> iv iron if no improvement
2. **High ferritin and transferrin** -> high Creat => CKD -> Nephrology
3. **All others** (low transferrin; high/normal ferritin) get IV iron (Chronic disease ± Fe def)
#### Intraop
- **Optimize hemostasis**
	- Hold antithrombotic medications preop where appropriate (including herbals that can affect hemostasis)
	- Correct coagulopathy
	- Tranexamic acid (antifibrinolytic)
	- Topical hemostatics
	- Maintain normothermia
- **Minimize blood loss**
	- Meticulous hemostasis
	- Minimally invasive techniques
	- Tourniquet prn
- **Maintain blood volume & hemoglobin concentration**
	- Replace losses w/ IV crystalloid or colloid until Hb drops below threshold
		- avoid large volume crystalloid infusion
	- Blood transfusion
		- Usual threshold ~70-80 g/L
		- Consider threshold of 90 g/L if:
			- significant ongoing bleeding
			- acute coronary syndrome
			- signs of myocardial/other organ ischemia
		- 1 unit of pRBCs increased Hb by ~10 g/L
- **Use of interdisciplinary blood conservation modalities**
	- Cell saver
	- Preop autologous donation (usually discouraged)
	- Acute normovolemic hemodilution
- **Patient-centered decision making**
#### Postop
- **Prevention of new-onset (hospital-acquired) anemia (or exacerbation of existing anemia)**
	- Monitor closely for postop bleeding
	- Limit vol & frequency of blood draws

### Thrombocytopenia
- **Risk**: Increased risk of hemorrhage.

### Hyperleukocytosis
- **Complications**:
  - **Leukostasis**: Blood flow obstruction by leukocytes.
  - **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy (DIC)**: Abnormal blood clotting throughout the body's blood vessels.
  - **Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)**:
	- **Metabolic Abnormalities**:
	  - Hyperuricemia
	  - Hyperkalemia
	  - Hyperphosphatemia
	  - Hypocalcemia
	- **Complications**: Acute renal failure.
  - **Bleeding and Thromboembolic Events**: Increased risk of both bleeding and clotting complications.
  - **Neurologic and Pulmonary Complications**: Risk of neurological deficits and respiratory issues.

### Bone Marrow Transplantation
- **Risk**: Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD), where the transplanted immune cells attack the recipient's body.

### Chemotherapy-Related End-Organ Dysfunction
- **Example**: Doxorubicin-associated cardiomyopathy (heart muscle damage leading to decreased cardiac function).
# Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome

## Summary of Antiphospholipid Syndrome

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311123229.png)

## Definition
- **Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APS)**: A condition where patients experience thromboses or pregnancy complications with laboratory evidence of antiphospholipid antibodies in their blood.

## Presentation
- **Acquired Autoimmune Disorder**: Characterized by venous and/or arterial thromboses and recurrent pregnancy loss.
- **Association**:
  - **Primary APS**: Occurs as the sole manifestation of an autoimmune process.
  - **Secondary APS**: Occurs in association with other autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis.

## Common Sites of Thrombosis
- **Venous Thrombosis**: Deep veins of the lower extremities are the most common sites.
- **Arterial Thrombosis**: The cerebral vasculature, leading to stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), is the most common site.

## Systemic Impact
- **Lungs**: Pulmonary embolism and other thrombotic complications.
- **Heart**: Thromboses can affect cardiac function and increase the risk of myocardial infarction.

# Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)

## Definition
- **DIC**: An acquired syndrome characterized by intravascular activation of coagulation without specific localization, leading to damage to the microvasculature and potential organ dysfunction. It is a thrombohaemorrhagic disorder.

## Clinical Presentation
- **Simultaneous Procoagulant and Hyperfibrinolytic Processes**: The predominant mechanism (thrombosis or bleeding) determines the presentation.
  - **Hyperfibrinolytic Form**: Rapid bursts of excess fibrin, typically seen in trauma or obstetric cases.
  - **Procoagulant Form**: Gradual excess of thrombin, typically seen in sepsis.

### Signs
**Bleeding**:
- Hemorrhages at multiple distant sites simultaneously.
- Extensive, uncontrolled bleeding from various sites (e.g., venipuncture sites, indwelling catheters/drains, retroperitoneal hemorrhages, ecchymoses, mucous membranes).

**Thrombosis**:
- Microvascular ischemia leading to organ dysfunction (renal, pulmonary, CNS).
- Thrombophlebitis.
- Respiratory distress syndrome.
- Renal impairment without obvious cause.
- Confusion or seizures.
- Dermal infarcts, skin necrosis, greyish discoloration of fingertips, toes, ears.

## Background
**Laboratory Features Suggestive of DIC**:
- Rapidly declining platelet count.
- Prolonged prothrombin (PT) time.
- Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT) time.
- Low fibrinogen levels (clinical feature in ~30% of severe cases).
- Raised fibrin degradation products (FDPs) and elevated D-dimer levels.

**Pathophysiology**:
- Systemic activation of coagulation due to exposure to procoagulants.
- Widespread intravascular fibrin deposition in microcirculation.
- Depletion of coagulation factors and platelets.
- Secondary activation of fibrinolysis.
- Results in microinfarcts, tissue hypoxia, and consumption coagulopathy.

**Common Conditions Associated with DIC**:
- Sepsis and severe infection.
- Trauma: severe tissue injury, head injury, fat embolism.
- Cancer: myeloproliferative diseases and solid tumors (e.g., pancreatic or prostate carcinomas).
- Obstetric complications: amniotic fluid embolism, placental abruption.
- Vascular disorders: aortic aneurysm, giant hemangiomas.
- Reaction to toxins: snake venom, drugs.
- Immunologic disorders: severe allergic reactions, hemolytic transfusion reactions, transplant rejection.

## Considerations
- **Emergency Management**:
  - Mobilize resources and delegate tasks.
  - Search for and correct the precipitating factor (e.g., obstetric hemorrhage, trauma, transfusion, sepsis).
- **Aggressive Treatment with Potential for Massive Transfusion**:
  - Manage hypothermia, hypocalcemia, factor dilution, thrombocytopenia, acidosis, volume overload (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury).
- **Sequelae of Bleeding and Thromboembolism**:
  - Bleeding: intracranial, thoracic, abdominal, cardiac tamponade.
  - Thrombosis: pulmonary embolism, acute renal failure, liver failure, stroke.

## Goals
- **Platelet Count**: Maintain above 50,000 (1 unit/10 kg; 0.1-0.2 units/kg).
- **Fresh Frozen Plasma**: 10 ml/kg to maintain INR < 1.5–2.
- **Cryoprecipitate**: Maintain fibrinogen > 1.5 g/L (2 units/10 kg), or > 2.0 g/L in pregnant patients.
- **Packed RBCs (pRBCs)**: To maintain organ perfusion.
- **Monitoring**: Follow coagulation profile, fibrinogen, hemoglobin, and platelets at least hourly.

## Recommendations
- **Heparin**: Not recommended, except possibly in DIC secondary to malignancies causing thrombosis.
- **Antifibrinolytics**: Not recommended.
# Factor 5 Leinden

### Background
- The factor V Leiden mutation results in resistance to activated protein C  thus causing thrombosis.
- Factor V Leiden is the The most common inherited thrombophilia in individuals with venous thromboembolism
- Other major hereditary disorders linked to hypercoagulability include antithrombin deficiency, protein C and S deficiencies, and prothrombin 20210A
### Considerations
- Patients may be on chronic anticoagulant or antiplatelets agents that may impact perioperative management, including the need for bridging therapy
- Patients are at increased risk of perioperative clotting events and need a DVT prophylaxis plan
# Hemophilia A&B

![](Pasted%20image%2020240312124241.png)

## Hemophilia Overview

**Background**
- **Definition**: X-linked recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of Factor VIII (Hemophilia A) or Factor IX (Hemophilia B).
- **Symptoms**: Results in spontaneous hemorrhage or uncontrolled bleeding with trauma or surgery.
- **Classification by Factor Levels**:
	- Mild: 5-25%
	- Moderate: 1-5%
	- Severe: <1%
- **Laboratory Findings**: Increased PTT, normal INR.

## Clinical Considerations

- **Perioperative Bleeding Risk**: High risk due to deficient clotting factors.
- **Bleeding Sequelae**: Potential for bleeding into enclosed spaces such as joints, intracranium, pericardium, and thorax.
- **Neuraxial Anesthesia**: Potential contraindication due to bleeding risk.
- **Factor Management**: Includes replacement/supplementation and identification of factor antibodies (e.g., inhibitors).
- **Coexisting Infections**: Possible viral infections from transfusions, such as HIV and hepatitis (reduced with recombinant products).
- **Hematology Consultation**: Preoperative consultation recommended to manage coagulation status.

## Perioperative Goals

- **Factor Optimization**: Ensure optimal factor activity and coagulation profile.
- **Blood Loss Minimization**: Implement blood conservation strategies.

## Optimization and Treatment

**Hemophilia A**
- **Mild Disease**: Desmopressin (DDAVP).
- **Severe Disease**:
	- Recombinant Factor VIII (Humate P).
	- Factor VIII concentrates (Fresh frozen plasma contains minimal Factor VIII).
	- Recombinant Factor VIIa for patients with inhibitors (approved indication).
	- Cryoprecipitate (if other options unavailable) which contains Factor VIII, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and Factor XIII.

**Hemophilia B**
- **Treatment**: Recombinant Factor IX.

### Management Options

**Factors and Blood Products**
1. **Recombinant FVIII or IX**:
	- Disease-free but costly.
	- Each U/kg increases factor level by 1% (Factor IX) or 2% (Factor VIII).
2. **Factor VIII Concentrates**:
	- Plasma-derived, used when recombinant factors are unavailable.
3. **Cryoprecipitate**:
	- Contains Factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, Factor XIII, and fibrinogen.
4. **Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC)**:
	- Contains Factors II, VII, IX, X, Proteins C and S.
	- Mostly used for warfarin reversal.
5. **Recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa)**:
	- Binds to activated platelet surface, directly activates Factor X, enhancing thrombin generation.
6. **Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)**:
	- No longer used routinely, contains all clotting factors.

**Pharmacological Options**
- **Desmopressin (DDAVP)**:
	- Releases von Willebrand factor, forms complex with Factor VIII, preventing breakdown.
	- Results in 2-5 fold increase in Factor VIII.
	- Ineffective in severe Hemophilia A or B.
- **Tranexamic Acid (TXA)**:
	- Effective in both Hemophilia and von Willebrand Disease (vWD).
# HIT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia)

## Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopaenia (HIT): From Exposure to Treatment

1. **Exposure**:
	- Heparin
	- LMWH
2. **Pathophysiology**:
	- Antigen-antibody complex
	- Platelet activation
3. **Symptoms**:
	- Thrombocytopaenia
	- Arterial/venous thrombosis
4. **Diagnosis**:
	- Clinical scoring
	- Assay testing
5. **Treatment**:
	- Heparin cessation
	- Alternate anticoagulation

## Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)

**Background**
- **Definition**: Severe immune-mediated disease resulting from exposure to heparin, leading to thrombosis (venous and arterial) and thrombocytopenia.
	- **Mechanism**: Formation of IgG antibodies against heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complexes. This leads to platelet activation and consumption, and activation of multiple prothrombotic pathways.
- **Clinical Presentation**:
	- Typically see a decrease in platelets by >30%, occurring 5-10 days after heparin initiation.
	- Platelet count rarely drops below 20.
	- Higher risk with unfractionated heparin (UFH) compared to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).

**4 Ts Scoring System (Pre-test Probability)**
1. **Thrombocytopenia/↓ Platelets**:
	- Nadir ≥ 20, 50% drop.
2. **Timing of Platelet Decrease**:
	- Occurs 5-10 days after starting heparin.
3. **Thrombosis**:
	- Presence of thrombosis.
4. **Other Causes Ruled Out**:
	- Perioperative considerations: sepsis, shock, mechanical circulatory support, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

**Diagnosis**
- Based on detection of PF4 antibodies and functional HIT assay.
	- **Note**: Assay results can take several days; if there is strong clinical suspicion, treat as HIT until proven otherwise.

**Prognosis**
- **Mortality Rate**: Approximately 10-20%.
## Criteria for Estimating the Pre-Test Probability of HIT Using the "4T" Score

|Score|0 Point|1 Point|2 Points|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Thrombocytopenia**|Platelet count fall < 30% or platelet nadir < 10 × 10⁹/L|Platelet count fall 30–50% or platelet nadir 10–19 × 10⁹/L|Platelet count fall > 50% or platelet nadir 20 × 10⁹/L|
|**Timing of platelet count fall**|Platelet count fall < 4 days without recent exposure|Consistent with days 5–10 fall, or within 1 day (if prior heparin exposure within 30 days)|Platelet count fall < 1 day (if prior heparin exposure within 100 days) or new thrombosis, skin necrosis, or post-intravenous unfractionated heparin bolus|
|**Thrombosis or other causes for thrombocytopenia**|Definite or possible|Possible|None apparent|

- **Probability Score**:
	- 0 to 3: Low pre-test probability (<5%)
	- 4 to 5: Intermediate pre-test probability (10-30%)
	- 6 to 8: High pre-test probability (20-80%)

### Common Tests for HIT

1. Heparin-induced platelet aggregation test
2. **Serotonin-14C release assay (gold standard)**
3. Solid-Phase PF4/Heparin Enzyme Immunoassay

## Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Considerations

**Acute HIT**
- **Intraoperative Anticoagulation during Cardiovascular Surgery (CVS) in Patients with Active HIT**:
	- **Bivalirudin**:
		- Requires modification of perfusion technique during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
		- May lead to excess bleeding, especially in patients with impaired renal function or complex cardiac surgery.
	- **Heparin + Reversible Antiplatelet Agent**:
		- Utilized in some cases with careful monitoring.
	- **Perioperative Plasmapheresis**:
		- Used to reduce HIT antibody burden.
	- **High-dose Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) + Ultra Short-acting Platelet Inhibitor (e.g., Cangrelor)**:
		- Facilitates heparin use during CPB.

**Prior HIT**
- **Delay Non-urgent Surgery**:
	- Postpone surgery for more than 1 month after diagnosis, if possible.
- **Bridging Anticoagulation**:
	- May require bridging anticoagulation (e.g., argatroban) if on warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).
- **Short-term Heparin Treatment**:
	- Possible if there is a remote history of HIT.

**Neuraxial Techniques**
- **Contraindicated**:
	- Avoid using neuraxial techniques with argatroban and bivalirudin due to bleeding risk.

### Prevention
- **Avoid Heparin**:
	- Use alternatives where possible.
- **Use LMWH Instead of UFH**:
	- Prefer low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) over unfractionated heparin (UFH).
- **Monitor Platelet Counts**:
	- Daily monitoring in high-risk patients.

## Management
1. **Discontinue Heparin**:
	- Stop all heparin exposure immediately.
2. **Direct Thrombin Inhibitors (DTI)**:
	- **Argatroban** and **Bivalirudin** are preferred.
	- **Fondaparinux** is another option.
3. **Transition to Long-term Anticoagulation**:
	- Consider transitioning to warfarin or DOAC for several months due to increased risk of thrombosis.
4. **Refractory Cases**:
	- Consider IVIG or plasmapheresis if refractory to DTIs.

## Management Summary
- **Thrombosis** rather than bleeding is the predominant feature, even in severe thrombocytopenia.

1. **Discontinue Heparin**.
2. **Monitor Platelet Counts**.
3. **Avoid Warfarin** until platelet counts recover.
4. **Test for HIT Antibodies**.
5. **Evaluate for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)**:
	- Increased risk (20-40 times) in HIT.
6. **Platelet Transfusions**:
	- Only given to treat bleeding, not thrombocytopenia.
7. **Anticoagulation with a Non-heparin Regimen**:
	- **Argatroban**
	- **Lepirudin** (suitable for patients with hepatic impairment)
	- **Bivalirudin**
	- **Danaparoid**

These measures are essential to manage HIT effectively and prevent complications associated with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia.

# Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura - ITP

## Background
- **Definition**: Acquired thrombocytopenia caused by autoantibodies against platelet antigens.
- **Diagnosis**: ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion; other causes of nonimmune and immune platelet destruction must be ruled out in a patient with isolated thrombocytopenia.
- **Treatment Goals**: In non-surgical settings, the aim is to prevent significant bleeding rather than to normalize platelet counts.
	- **Critical Bleeding**:
		- Platelet transfusions.
		- Glucocorticoids (typically pulse dexamethasone).
		- Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG).
	- **Severe Bleeding**:
		- Treated with glucocorticoids.
	- **Refractory Cases**:
		- Rituximab.
		- Thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists.
		- Splenectomy.

## Considerations for ITP Patients

**Surgical Bleeding Risk and Platelet Count Requirements**
- **Hematology Involvement**: Recommended for managing perioperative platelet counts and bleeding risks.
- **Platelet Thresholds**:
	- For major surgery: Maintain platelet count >50,000/microL.
	- For neurosurgery: Maintain platelet count >100,000/microL.
- **Emergency Surgery**:
	- Platelet transfusions may be necessary.
	- Use steroids, IVIG, or a TPO receptor agonist like romiplostim to raise platelet counts.

**Neuraxial Anesthesia Considerations**
- **Platelet Count Guidelines**:
	- Safe for neuraxial anesthesia if platelet count >70,000/microL.
	- Potentially acceptable with platelet counts between 50,000-70,000/microL, depending on risk-benefit analysis.
	- Contraindicated if platelet count <50,000/microL.
- **Controversy and Variation**: Exact safe platelet level for spinal and epidural techniques varies by clinician.

**Medication Considerations**
- Be aware of and manage medications that ITP patients may be receiving, as these can affect platelet counts and bleeding risk.

## Summary

- **ITP** is an acquired condition characterized by thrombocytopenia due to autoantibodies against platelets.
- **Diagnosis** requires exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia.
- **Treatment** focuses on preventing bleeding, not normalizing platelet counts.
	- Critical and severe bleeding managed with platelet transfusions, glucocorticoids, and IVIG.
	- Refractory cases may require rituximab, TPO receptor agonists, or splenectomy.
- **Perioperative Management**:
	- Hematology consultation is critical.
	- Maintain specific platelet thresholds for surgery.
	- Platelet transfusions, steroids, IVIG, or TPO receptor agonists may be used to raise platelet counts as needed.
- **Neuraxial Anesthesia**:
	- Generally safe if platelet count >70,000/microL.
	- Consideration needed for platelet counts between 50,000-70,000/microL.
	- Contraindicated if platelet count <50,000/microL.
# Jehovah's Witness

### Jehovah’s Witness Patients and Blood Products

**Background**
- **Religious Beliefs**: Orthodox Jehovah’s Witnesses refuse homologous or autologous whole blood, packed red blood cells (pRBCs), plasma, platelets, and white blood cells (WBCs) due to religious beliefs based on a literal interpretation of Bible passages forbidding the “eating” of blood.
- **Consequences**: They believe that failing to adhere strictly to these commands may result in the loss of eternal life.

**Blood Products Usually Refused**
- **Whole Blood**
- **Red Blood Cells (RBCs)**
- **Platelets**
- **Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)**
- **Cryoprecipitated Antihemophilic Factor**
- **Granulocytes**
- **Fibrin Glue/Sealant**
- **Predeposited Autologous Blood/Components**

**Blood Products Usually Accepted**
- **Normovolemic Hemodilution**: Accepted if the patient remains in continuous contact with their blood.
- **Intraoperative RBC Salvage**: Accepted under the same condition of continuous contact.
- **Erythropoietin**: Accepted if albumin-free.
- **Hemodialysis**: Accepted if non-blood prime is used.
- **Heart-Lung Equipment**: Also accepted if non-blood prime is used.

**Individual Decision (Based on Personal Preference)**
- **Albumin**
- **Immune Globulins**
- **Factor Concentrates**
- **Organ and Tissue Transplants**

### Considerations for Management
- **Patient Autonomy**: Respect the individual decisions of Jehovah’s Witness patients regarding the acceptance or refusal of specific blood products and treatments.
- **Informed Consent**: Ensure thorough discussions with the patient to understand their preferences and obtain informed consent, particularly regarding blood management strategies during surgery or medical treatment.
- **Alternative Strategies**: Employ blood conservation techniques and alternative treatments to manage anemia or blood loss, such as the use of erythropoietin, iron supplements, and careful surgical techniques.
- **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Collaborate with hematologists, anesthesiologists, surgeons, and ethicists to develop a comprehensive plan that aligns with the patient’s beliefs and medical needs.

**Considerations**
- **Preoperative Hemoglobin Optimization & Perioperative Blood Conservation**: Essential to manage the increased risk of surgical bleeding.
  
**Legal Issues**
- **Patient's Legal Rights**:
  - The legal right to refuse or consent to treatment is based on common law, evolving as new cases are decided.
  - Clinicians should not administer emergency treatment without consent if they believe the patient would refuse if capable.
  - For pediatric cases, the child may be made a ward of the court to administer necessary blood transfusions.

**Informed Consent**
- **Risks and Benefits**:
  - Outline the risks and benefits of receiving or refusing transfusions specific to the patient’s clinical situation.
- **Alternatives**:
  - Discuss alternatives to transfusion, including transferring the patient to a facility with more experience.
- **Patient Preferences**:
  - Determine which blood products/procedures the patient will accept and refuse.
- **Court Intervention**:
  - Follow procedures to obtain court intervention for pediatric patients, patients with dementia, comatose patients, etc., if necessary.

## Conflicts in Management
- **Beneficence vs. Autonomy**:
  - Autonomy generally takes precedence over beneficence.
  - Physicians must respect a competent adult patient’s right to refuse treatment, even though they are ordinarily taught to preserve life.

## Management Aims
1. **Minimize Blood Loss**
2. **Optimize Oxygen Delivery and Consumption**
3. **Enhance Hemoglobin (Hb) Synthesis and Erythropoiesis**
4. **Correct Coagulation Defects and Promote Hemostasis**
## Preoperative Hemoglobin Optimization
- **Enhance RBC Production**:
  - **Iron Supplementation**:
	- Oral in divided doses or IV if there is limited time before surgery, intolerance to oral iron, or gastrointestinal absorption issues.
  - **Folate and/or Vitamin B12 Supplementation**: For deficiencies.
  - **Erythropoietin**: For anemia of renal or chronic disease.

## Minimizing Iatrogenic Blood Loss
- Avoid unnecessary testing.
- Minimize test sample volume (use pediatric tubes).

## Minimizing Intraoperative Blood Loss
- Employ meticulous surgical technique.
- Use regional anesthesia.
- Maintain normothermia and physiological pH.
- Utilize intraoperative cell salvage.
- Perform normovolemic hemodilution.
## Ensuring Hemostasis
- **Antifibrinolytic Agents**:
  - **Tranexamic Acid**:
	- A lysine analogue that competitively inhibits plasminogen activation. It is 10 times more potent than ε-aminocaproic acid.
	- Prophylactic and emergency use is well-recognized, with doses of 500-1000 mg IV or 10 mg/kg every 6 hours, up to a maximum rate of 100 mg/min.
  - **Aprotinin**:
	- A direct plasmin inhibitor that inhibits fibrinolysis. Its use was associated with increased mortality in the 2008 BART study, but the European Medicines Agency has recommended lifting its suspension for named patient use.
- **Fibrinogen Concentrate**: If acceptable to the patient.
- **Desmopressin**:
  - A synthetic analogue of vasopressin, improves hemostasis by stimulating hepatic release of clotting factor VIII and endothelial release of tissue plasminogen activator and von Willebrand factor.
  - Suggested preoperative test dose: 0.3 μg/kg as an infusion over 30-45 minutes.
- **Prothrombin Complex Concentrates**: Where appropriate.
- **Recombinant Factor VIIa**: Use is controversial.

## Maintaining Circulating Blood Volume
- Use crystalloids and synthetic colloids.

## General Principles for Blood Management
- Act promptly to minimize blood loss.
- Establish Jehovah’s Witness status, capacity, competence, legal issues, and advance directives.
- Determine acceptable therapies.
- Plan for worst-case scenarios.
- Establish the cause or source of bleeding (medical or surgical).
- Provide thorough documentation.
- Early involvement of consultants and referrals.
- Close monitoring and limited phlebotomy.
- Low threshold for high-dependency unit/intensive care unit admission.

### In Pregnancy
- Epidural blood patch may be acceptable if blood remains in constant connection to patient (i.e. injecting syringe is connected to vein via tube)
## Blood Conservation Strategies

[Blood conservation](Blood%20conservation.md)

### General Interventions

1. **Positioning**:
	- Adjust to minimize cardiovascular effects that may increase bleeding risk by altering preload, cardiac output, and peripheral vascular resistance.
2. **Mode of Ventilation**:
	- **Spontaneous Positive Ventilation (SPV) vs. Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV)**: Manage intrathoracic pressure carefully.
3. **Avoid Hypothermia**:
	- Prevent hypothermia to avoid potential coagulopathy and blood loss.

### Specific Interventions

1. **Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution (ANH)**:
	- Involves removal of blood followed by rapid infusion of colloid or crystalloid to restore plasma volume.
	- Surgical blood loss will have a lower hematocrit, and stored blood can be reinfused later.
	- May not be acceptable to Jehovah’s Witnesses unless a closed circuit is used, despite evidence suggesting reduced risk of allogeneic transfusion.
2. **Acute Hypervolemic Hemodilution**:
	- Simpler and more acceptable alternative, does not involve removal of patient’s blood.
3. **Hypotensive Anesthesia**:
	- Defined as maintaining a systolic blood pressure of 80-90 mm Hg, a mean arterial pressure of 50-65 mm Hg, or a 30% reduction from baseline mean arterial pressure.
	- Used to reduce perioperative blood loss and improve surgical field visibility.
4. **Regional and Central Neuraxial Anesthesia**:
	- Associated with reduced estimated blood loss and postoperative transfusion requirements compared to general anesthesia.

### Surgical Care

- **Meticulous Hemostasis**: Key principle to reduce blood loss during surgery.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Surgical Technique**: Prefer endoscopic or laparoscopic approaches.
- **Use of Diathermy and Ultrasonic Scalpels**: To minimize bleeding.
- **Hemostatic Agents**: Use of collagen or cellulose pads (e.g., Kaltostat) and fibrin glues and sealants (e.g., Tisseel).
- **Staged Procedures**: Consider if surgery is expected to be complex and lengthy.

### Blood-Conservation Summary

- **Optimize Preoperative Hemoglobin**:
	- Enhance RBC production with iron, folate, vitamin B12, and erythropoietin.
- **Minimize Iatrogenic and Intraoperative Blood Loss**:
	- Avoid unnecessary testing and minimize test sample volume.
	- Use meticulous surgical techniques and appropriate anesthesia methods.
- **Ensure Hemostasis**:
	- Employ antifibrinolytic agents, desmopressin, and other hemostatic measures as acceptable to the patient.
- **Maintain Circulating Blood Volume**:
	- Use crystalloids and synthetic colloids.

**General Principles for Blood Management in Jehovah’s Witness Patients**

- Act promptly to minimize blood loss.
- Establish Jehovah’s Witness status, capacity, competence, legal issues, and advance directives.
- Determine acceptable therapies.
- Plan for worst-case scenarios.
- Establish the cause or source of bleeding (medical or surgical).
- Provide thorough documentation.
- Early consultant involvement and referral.
- Close monitoring and limited phlebotomy.
- Low threshold for high-dependency unit/intensive care unit admission.
## Counselling
### Elective and Emergency Frameworks

#### Elective Framework

- Organize confidential meeting (free from coercion; medical, religious, or familial)
- Explain that your opinions are based on current best evidence and practice and your aim is not to be coercive, only informative
- Discuss the need to optimize haemoglobin before surgery and potential for postponement
- Establish Jehovah’s Witness status, beliefs, and advance directive
- Establish opinion on blood products, highlighting local availability, experience or inexperience with alternative or novel therapies, etc.
- Determine what products or procedures are acceptable or unacceptable
- Explain proposed medical intervention, including pros, cons, risks (including death, disability, and suffering) and alternatives (including no intervention)
- Form worst-case scenario plan
- Fully document discussion and acceptable options

#### Emergency Framework

- Depends on:
	- Presence of capacity
	- Patient age
	- Presence of an advance directive
- Aim for a private discussion with patient or next of kin, free from coercion (medical, religious, or familial)
- Establish urgency and time-sensitive nature of scenario
- Establish Jehovah’s Witness status and position on blood and blood products
- Use collateral sources if necessary, including advanced directives and hospital Jehovah’s Witness liaison
- Explain clearly the patient’s condition, prognosis, and treatment options, including your recommendation
- Aim for consensus and compromise
- If consensus and compromise are impossible, consider the patient’s best interests with regard to the law
- Fully document discussion, actions, etc.

### Association of Anaesthetists: Anaesthesia and Peri-Operative Care for Jehovah’s Witnesses and Patients Who Refuse Blood

1. Patients should be given a clear explanation of the blood products that the medical team looking after them consider might be required during or after surgery, and the risks involved if they refuse. Discussion of alternative treatments should be undertaken if available.
2. It should be clearly documented in the medical record which treatments and/or procedures the patient consents to and which they do not.
3. At least 6 weeks before elective surgery likely to be associated with significant blood loss, the patient’s Hb should be checked and if < 130 g·L⁻¹, optimization by treatment with iron and/or erythropoietin should be considered.
4. All relevant issues should be highlighted at the time of the team briefing and during the surgical safety checklist before induction of anaesthesia. A specific checklist recording which components/products/procedures the patient will or will not accept should be available.
5. The majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses will accept intra-operative cell salvage - this should be discussed before surgery and set up from the start of surgery. Consent should be obtained.
6. The interventions promoted as part of a 'patient blood management' approach should be rigorously applied, including tranexamic acid administration for major surgery.
7. After surgery, a comprehensive verbal and written handover of the patient is essential. Staff should be made aware of any adverse intra-operative events that will have been discussed before surgery.

# Sickle Cell Disease

## Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314171141.png)

## Sickle Cell Disease: Considerations and Management

**Multisystem Disease with End-Organ Dysfunction:**
- **CNS**: Stroke
- **Cardiovascular**: LV hypertrophy, high-output cardiac failure (anemia), myocardial infarction without coronary artery disease
- **Respiratory**: Acute chest syndrome (ACS), restrictive lung disease (pulmonary fibrosis), pulmonary hypertension, RV hypertrophy, cor-pulmonale
- **Renal**: Renal failure, renal infarction
- **Spleen**: Sequestration, infarcts; post-splenectomy patients have reduced immunity

**Perioperative Considerations:**
- **Exacerbations of Vaso-Occlusive Crises**: Acute pain crisis, ACS
- **Chronic Hemolytic Anemia**: Chronic RBC transfusion and its complications (alloimmunization, iron overload, viral transmission)
- **Chronic Pain and Potential Opioid Tolerance**
- **Preoperative Optimization**: Consider preoperative transfusion with a goal hematocrit of 30% and hemoglobin of 100 g/L.
- **Medications**: Immunosuppressants, antineoplastics

## Sickle Cell Disease Pathogenesis

- **Normal Adult Hemoglobin (Hb) Composition**:
	- 96% HbA (α₂β₂ chains)
	- 2% HbA₂ (α₂δ₂ chains)
	- 2% HbF (fetal hemoglobin, α₂γ₂ chains)
- **Genetic Mutation**:
	- DNA point mutation in chromosome 11 results in Glu→Val substitution in the β-globin chain, leading to the formation of Hemoglobin S (HbS) instead of normal HbA.
- **Hemoglobin S Variants**:
	- **Heterozygous mutation (Hb AS)**: Sickle cell trait (asymptomatic unless severely hypoxic)
	- **Homozygous mutation (Hb SS)**: Sickle cell disease
- **Hb Electrophoresis Results**:
	- Sickle cell trait: 45% HbS, 52% HbA, 2% HbA₂, 1% HbF
	- Sickle cell disease: 90% HbS, 8% HbF, 2% HbA₂, no HbA
- **Pathophysiology**:
	- Hydrophilic Glu is substituted by hydrophobic Val, making HbS less soluble and prone to polymerization in its deoxygenated state, leading to sickling of RBCs.
- **Precipitating Factors**:
	- **Dehydration**: Decreased RBC cytoplasm volume
	- **Hypoxemia**: Decreased O₂ saturation of Hb
	- **Acidosis**: O₂ is more readily released from Hb in a low pH environment
- **Treatment Notes**:
	- Hydroxyurea increases HbF synthesis, decreasing HbS proportion and reducing sickling. Transfusion or exchange transfusion can also be effective.

## Sickle Cell Pain Crises

**Types of Crises**
1. **Vaso-occlusive Crisis**: Occurs when sickle RBCs slow or stop flow within blood vessels.
2. **Aplastic Crisis**: Caused by Parvovirus B19; bone marrow does not produce enough RBCs.
3. **Splenic Sequestration**: Sickle RBCs build up within the spleen resulting in an enlarged spleen.
4. **Acute Chest Syndrome**: A vaso-occlusive crisis that occurs within the lungs caused by infection.

**Optimization (In Consultation with Hematology)**
- **Risk Factors for Acute Pain Crises**: Age, frequency of hospitalizations/transfusions, evidence of organ damage, history of CNS events, concurrent infection
- **Procedural Risk for Complications**:
	- **Low**: Minor surgery (e.g., inguinal hernia, extremity surgery)
	- **Intermediate**: Intra-abdominal operations (e.g., cholecystectomy)
	- **High**: Intracranial and intrathoracic procedures, hip surgery
- **Hematology Consult**: Optimize treatment, hydroxyurea to increase HbF production
- **Cancel Non-Emergent Cases**: If patient is experiencing a crisis
- **Consider Outpatient Surgery**: Only for low-risk patients
- **IV Fluids**: To avoid dehydration while NPO
- **Preoperative Transfusion Therapy**:
	- Controversial, purpose is to correct pre-existing anemia, decrease hemoglobin S concentration, and increase adult hemoglobin
	- Target hemoglobin 100 or hematocrit 30% for intermediate/high-risk surgeries
	- Exchange transfusions not routinely recommended

## Sickle Cell Crisis

**Management of Acute Sickle Cell Crisis**
- **Precipitating Factors**: Cold weather, infection, stress, drugs
- **Complications**:
	- **Acute Chest Syndrome**: Difficult to distinguish between pneumonia and vaso-occlusive infarct. Consider CXR, ABG, blood transfusion, and invasive ventilatory support.
	- **Abdominal Crisis**: Think splenic and hepatic sequestration. Consider CT abdomen.
	- **Stroke**: Occurs in adults and children. Distinguish between other causes (e.g., meningoencephalitis). Consider CT head.
	- **Avascular Necrosis**: Bone and joint pain, commonly in the hip. Consider X-ray of limbs.
	- **Priapism**: Urological emergency. Consider aspiration.
	- **Aplastic Crisis**: Parvovirus B19 causing life-threatening drop in Hb level. Consider red cell transfusion.

**Treatment**
- **Oxygen**: 15L via non-rebreather mask
- **Prompt Analgesia**: E.g., morphine, manage with patient's analgesia plan
- **IV Fluids**
- **IV Antibiotics**: If infection is suspected
- **Keep Patient Warm**: Use warmed fluids/bair hugger
- **Refer to Hematology Team for Admission**

**Treatment Modalities**
1. **Infection Prevention**: Penicillin prophylaxis and vaccination
2. **Hydroxyurea**: Increases HbF, but also causes myelosuppression
3. **Erythropoietin**: For anemia
4. **Primary Stroke Prevention**: Annual transcranial doppler and top-up transfusion to >9 g/dL, reduce HbS to <30%
5. **Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation**

**Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS)**
- **Background**: Second most common reason for hospitalization, characterized by acute respiratory symptoms and new infiltrate on CXR
- **Treatment**:
	- Admit to monitored setting, possibly ICU
	- Hydration to euvolemia
	- Oxygen, noninvasive PPV if necessary
	- Bronchodilators
	- Broad-spectrum antibiotics
	- Transfusion (simple or exchange)
	- Adequate analgesia
	- Possibly inhaled nitric oxide for severe cases

**Acute Pain Crisis (Vaso-occlusive Crisis)**
- **Management**:
	- Rest, warmth, reassurance, analgesia, fluid replacement
	- Opioids for severe pain
	- NSAIDs for bone pain
	- Ketamine as adjunct
	- Regional blocks as appropriate

## General Principles for Blood Management in Sickle Cell Disease
- **Act Promptly**: Minimize blood loss
- **Establish Status**: Determine Jehovah’s Witness status, capacity, competence, legal issues, and advance directives
- **Determine Acceptable Therapies**
- **Plan for Worst-Case Scenarios**
- **Establish Cause or Source of Bleeding**
- **Provide Thorough Documentation**
- **Early Consultant Involvement**
- **Close Monitoring and Limited Phlebotomy**
- **Low Threshold for High-Dependency Unit/ICU Admission**
## Long-Term Complications of Sickle Cell Disease

- **Gall Stones**
- **Retinopathy**
- **Leg Ulcers**
- **Chronic Renal Failure**
- **Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)**
- **Chronic Lung Disease**
- **Neurological Impairment**
- **Chronic Bone Damage**

## Pregnancy Considerations

**Interaction with Pregnancy**

- Pregnancy typically exacerbates sickle cell anemia complications.
- Maternal mortality is as high as 1%.
- Pulmonary embolism and infection are the leading causes of death.

**Management**

- **Hemoglobin Goals**:
	- > 80 g/L for vaginal delivery.
		
	- > 100 g/L for cesarean delivery.
		
- **Epidural**: Strongly recommended during labor to reduce stress and pain.
- **Anesthesia for Cesarean Section**: Both general anesthesia (GA) and neuraxial anesthesia are safe.
- **Goals**: Avoid hypovolemia, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, hypothermia, pain, and stress.
# Thalassemia

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314172500.png)

## Thalassemia: An Overview

### Background

Thalassemia involves a decrease in the synthesis of either the alpha or beta chains of hemoglobin, leading to the precipitation of unpaired chains and premature red blood cell (RBC) destruction.

### Considerations

**Chronic Hemolytic Anemia:**
- **Compensatory Mechanisms:**
  - Increased cardiac output
  - Elevated 2,3-DPG levels
  - Increased plasma volume
- **Complications:**
  - Cholelithiasis
  - Splenomegaly

**Sequelae of Multiple Transfusions/Iron Overload:**
- Cardiomyopathy and dysrhythmias
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Hepatic fibrosis and diabetes
- Alloimmunization

## Types of Thalassemia

1. **Beta Thalassemia Major:**
	- **Potential Difficult Airway:** Maxillary overgrowth from bone marrow stimulation.
	- **Hemochromatosis:** Deposition of hemosiderin into cardiac muscle leading to dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and conduction delays.
	- **Jaundice:** Secondary to hemolysis.
	- **Hemolytic Anemia:** Ongoing destruction of RBCs.
	- **Bone Complications:** Thinning of cortical bone, potentially leading to difficult regional anesthesia due to vertebral destruction.

2. **Beta Thalassemia Minor:**
	- **Mild Hemolytic Anemia:** Often accompanied by iron deficiency.

3. **Alpha Thalassemia Major:**
	- **Incompatible with Life:** Severe imbalance in globin chain production.

4. **Alpha Thalassemia Minor:**
	- **Mild Anemia:** Less severe imbalance in globin chain production.

## Beta-Thalassemia Specific Considerations

**Transfusion Dependency (Homozygous):**
- **Signs of Iron Overload:**
  - Affected organs include the liver, pancreas (leading to diabetes mellitus), pituitary, thyroid, and heart (resulting in heart failure).
- **Antibody Production:**
  - Potential delays in crossmatching due to alloimmunization.
- **Splenomegaly:**
  - May lead to thrombocytopenia.
- **Airway Difficulties:**
  - Overgrowth and deformity of the frontal bone, complicating airway management.

## Goals
- **Preoperative Hemoglobin Optimization:** Ensure the patient is not anemic for surgery, typically aiming for a hemoglobin level > 100 g/L.
- **Airway Management:** Anticipate a potentially difficult airway in patients with beta-thalassemia major.

## Intraoperative Management

1. **Cardiostability:**
   - Implement adequate monitoring tailored to the degree of cardiac involvement, including continuous ECG, invasive blood pressure monitoring, and potentially echocardiography.

2. **Pulmonary Management:**
   - Be aware of possible restrictive lung disease and pulmonary hypertension (PHT).
   - Optimize ventilation strategies to avoid triggers for pulmonary complications.

3. **Blood Management:**
   - Aim to maintain hemoglobin at 10 g/dL, considering preoperative transfusion with leucodepleted blood if necessary.
   - Employ blood-conserving strategies.
   - Cell salvage is controversial and should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

4. **Anesthesia Type and Agents:**
   - The choice between regional anesthesia and general anesthesia (GA) should be based on the procedure and patient-specific factors.
   - **Airway Management:** Plan for a potentially difficult airway.
   - **Neuraxial Anesthesia Challenges:** Skeletal deformities may complicate neuraxial anesthesia, monitoring placement, and IV access.

5. **General Considerations:**
   - **Thromboprophylaxis:** Increased risk of thrombosis necessitates the use of stockings, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and early mobilization.
   - **Aseptic Technique:** Maintain strict aseptic techniques to prevent infections.
   - **Careful Handling:** Ensure careful transfer and positioning of the patient due to osteopenia and fragile skin.
# Tumor Lysis Syndrome

## Pathways

- Increased potassium, purine nucleic acids, phosphorus, decreased calcium.

## Consequences

- Cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, neurological disturbances.

## Considerations

- Tumor lysis syndrome is a group of metabolic abnormalities that can occur as a complication during the treatment of cancer, where large amounts of tumor cells are lysed simultaneously by the treatment, releasing their contents into the bloodstream.
- Severe acute life-threatening condition with potential for multi-system failure:
  - Hyperkalemia and secondary arrhythmias.
  - Hyperuricemia and acute renal failure.
  - Hypocalcemia and risk of seizures, tetany.
  - Hyperphosphatemia and prolonged QT interval.

## Criteria for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (Cairo-Bishop)

- **Laboratory TLS**: Elevated uric acid, potassium, phosphorus, decreased calcium.
- **Clinical TLS**: Laboratory TLS plus acute kidney injury, seizure, arrhythmia, sudden death.

## Influence of Anesthesia on Cancer Recurrence and Metastasis

- **Factors**: Stress, HPA stimulation, inhaled anesthetics, opioids, inflammation.
- **Impact**: Immunosuppression, angiogenesis, metastasis promotion.
- **Drugs**: NSAIDs, propofol, regional anesthesia shown to reduce adverse outcomes.

## Treatment

- Admission to a high-acuity setting.
- Rapid diagnosis and treatment of metabolic derangements.
- Prevent and support renal failure:
  - Volume loading (20 mL/kg) and 1.5-2 times maintenance.
  - If volume overloaded, consider diuretics and potentially dialysis.
- Acute treatment of hyperkalemia and life-threatening arrhythmias.
- Rasburicase/allopurinol for hyperuricemia.
# Von Willebrand's Disease (vWD)

## Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314173116.png)

## Background
- **Von Willebrand Factor (VWF):** A large multimeric protein synthesized by the endothelium and megakaryocytes. VWF is either released into circulation or stored in the Weibel–Palade bodies of the endothelium and in the α-granules of platelets.
- **Functions of VWF:**
  - Acts as a carrier protein for circulating factor VIII, preventing its proteolytic degradation.
  - Assists in platelet adhesion at the site of injury.
- **Inheritance and Presentation:**
  - VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder.
  - It is primarily a disorder of the chief platelet adhesion factor, VWF, rather than a true platelet disorder.
  - **Types of VWD:**
	- **Type 1 VWD:** Mild-to-moderate quantitative deficiency with a balanced reduction of activity and factor level.
	- **Type 2 VWD:** Qualitative defects in VWF structure and function, characterized by a discrepancy in antigenic level and functional activity. Subtypes include A, B, N, and M.
	- **Type 3 VWD:** Severe quantitative deficiency of VWF activity and level.
- **Clinical Features:**
  - Normal platelet count with poor platelet function (except in type 3 VWD).
  - Reduced factor VIII levels may prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).
  - A normal aPTT does not exclude a bleeding tendency in the presence of a significant bleeding history.

## Considerations
- High risk for perioperative bleeding.
- Risk of bleeding in enclosed spaces (joints, intracranial, pericardium, thorax).
- Potential contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia.
- Consultation with hematology for factor optimization (replacement/supplementation).

## Goals
- Optimize factor activity and coagulation profile in the perioperative period.
- Employ techniques to minimize perioperative blood loss.

## Optimization
- **Hematology Consultation:** Essential for appropriate factor management.
- **Surgical Scheduling:** Preferably early in the week and day to ensure availability of lab, blood bank, and consultant resources.
- **Preoperative Factor Level Assessment:**
  - Assay factor levels 48 hours prior to surgery.
  - Restore levels to 40% of normal prior to surgery as dictated by the procedure.
  - **Key Trough Factor VIII Levels:**
	- Obstetric procedures: > 50%
	- Minor surgery: > 30%
	- Major surgery: > 50%
- **Monitoring:**
  - Repeat factor assay after initial administration to confirm factor activity within 2 hours of the expected OR start.
  - Continue intraoperative monitoring of factor activity levels as dictated by the clinical situation.
- **Medication Avoidance:** Avoid all anti-platelet medications.
- **Antifibrinolytics:** Consider use during the perioperative period for up to 3-5 days.

## Management
- **Guidance:** Treatment must be directed by a hematologist experienced in managing hemophilia.
- **Therapeutic Options:**
  - **Desmopressin (DDAVP):** Stimulates release of VWF from endothelial cells, useful in mild type 1 VWD.
	- Dosage: 0.3 mcg/kg (provides a 3-5 fold increase in activity).
	- Maximum effect at 30 minutes post-dose, levels remain elevated for 6-8 hours.
  - **Factor VIII-VWF Concentrates (Humate P)**
  - **Platelet Concentrates:** Contains VWF.
  - **Recombinant Factor VIII**
  - **Recombinant Factor VIIa**
  - **Emergency Treatment:** Cryoprecipitate (contains VWF, factor VIII, factor XIII, fibronectin, fibrinogen).

## Pregnancy
- **Baseline Factor Assessment:** Establish baseline factor VIII, VWF, and ristocetin cofactor levels early in pregnancy and at 34 weeks.
- **Prophylactic Treatment:** Administer if factor VIII level is < 25% (typically levels increase during pregnancy).
- **Responder Status:**
  - **Responder:** Administer DDAVP 0.3 mcg/kg IV every 12 hours at labor onset.
  - **Non-responder:** Use Humate P or cryoprecipitate.
- **Labor and Delivery/Cesarean Section:** Maintain factor levels > 50% of normal.
- **Postpartum Management:** Monitor levels and treat if factor VIII is < 25% or in case of significant hemorrhage.
- **Regional Anesthesia:** Epidural is safe if factor VIII and VWF levels are > 50%.
# Coagulation Testing

## Thrombocytopenia

### Definition
- Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of less than 150 × 10^9/L.

### Causes
1. **Decreased Production of Platelets:**
	- **Selective Impairment:**
		- Drugs: Alcohol, thiazide diuretics, cytotoxic drugs
		- Viral infections
	- **Generalized Bone Marrow Disease:**
		- Aplastic anemia
		- Marrow infiltration in leukemia
		- Disseminated cancer

2. **Decreased Platelet Survival:**
	- **Immune Basis:**
		- Idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura
		- Systemic lupus erythematosus
		- Drugs: Heparin
		- Infections: Infectious mononucleosis, HIV, CMV
	- **Non-Immune Basis:**
		- Disseminated intravascular coagulation
		- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
		- Cardiopulmonary bypass

3. **Sequestration:**
	- Hypersplenism

4. **Dilutional:**
	- Following massive transfusion of stored blood

## Activated Clotting Time (ACT)

### Methods
1. **Hemochron:**
	- Blood is warmed and rotated until coagulation displaces a magnetic bar in the tube, preventing its signal from being detected.
2. **Hemotec:**
	- A reagent (e.g., kaolin) is added to blood. A plunger moving up and down through the tube moves slower as coagulation progresses.

### Normal Range
- 107 ± 13 seconds

### Usage
- ACT is routinely used to monitor coagulation during full heparinization. It maintains a linear dose-response relationship even at high doses of heparin and can be tested at intervals "on the fly," facilitating rapid heparin infusion.

### Factors Prolonging ACT
- Hypothermia
- Hemodilution
- Platelet dysfunction
- Low fibrinogen, even with incomplete heparinization

### ACT Modification
- **Heparinase:** Used to modify ACT readings.

## Excessive Bleeding Following Minor Trauma Workup

### Initial Workup
1. **First Line Step: PT and aPTT**
	- **Normal Results:** No further testing required.
	- **Abnormal PT and Normal/Subnormal aPTT:** Measure factors VII, X, V, II.
	- **Abnormal aPTT and Normal/Subnormal PT:**
		- **Prolonged TT:** Check for heparin and measure fibrinogen.
		- **Normal TT:** Perform aPTT on plasma mixture.
			- **Correction:** Indicates factor VIII, IX, XI, or XII deficiency.
			- **No Correction:** Check for lupus anticoagulant (LA).

### Coagulation Pathways
- **aPTT:** Assesses intrinsic (factors XII, XI, IX, VIII) and common pathways (factors X, II, I).
- **PT/INR:** Assesses extrinsic (factor VII) and common pathways (factors X, II, I).
- **TT:** Assesses common pathway only (factors X, II, I).
- **D-Dimer:** Indicates active fibrinolysis.
### Technical Performance and Likely Confounders of Coagulation Tests

|**Test**|**Main Indication**|**Technical Performance of Test**|**Likely Confounders**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**aPTT**|- Testing intrinsic and common pathways|- Kaolin added to plasma → activates FXII|- Turbid sample → false negative|
||- UFH monitoring||- FXIII deficiency not detected|
||- Heparin monitoring|||
|**INR**|- Testing extrinsic and common pathways|- TF added to sample → activates FVII|- Nutrition, stress, alcohol|
||- Monitor Warfarin|||
|**In vitro platelet testing**|- Thrombocytopenia|- Platelets exposed to high shear and flow rate drops as plug forms (PFA)|- Non-specific|

### Prolonged aPTT/PT/Thrombin Time
#### aPTT

- **Measure of intrinsic pathway coagulation factors**
	- Isolated prolonged aPTT: Deficiency of FXII, XI, IX, VIII; Lupus anticoagulant antibodies; Antibodies to FVIII or FIX (i.e., acquired haemophilia)
	- Prolonged aPTT and PT: Vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin); Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); Common pathway deficiency; Afibrinogenaemia and dysfibrinogenaemia; Direct thrombin inhibitors; Malabsorption (leading to vitamin K deficiency); High concentrations of unfractionated heparin; Dilutional coagulopathy (e.g., massive blood transfusion)

#### PT

- **Measures extrinsic and common pathway activity**
	- Isolated prolonged PT: Deficiency of factor VII; Prolonged thrombin time; Hypofibrinogenaemia (e.g., acquired from DIC, malignancy, liver disease); Following thrombolysis; Congenital deficiencies of fibrinogen; Direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran); Reduced; DIC; Liver disease; Inherited deficiency of fibrinogen; Thrombolysis; Increased; Pregnancy; Female sex; Acute phase response

#### Thrombin Time

- **Time to fibrin clot after addition of thrombin**

## D-Dimer

- **Definition:** D-Dimer is a fibrin degradation product tested as a marker of abnormal clot formation and subsequent fibrinolysis.
- **Testing Method:**
  - **Latex Agglutination:**
	- Latex particles are coated with monoclonal antibodies specific for D-Dimer.
	- These particles are added to plasma, where they agglutinate upon exposure to D-Dimer.
	- Agglutination increases the absorption of monochromatic light when passed through the sample, indicating the presence of D-Dimer.

## Principle Behind Performing a Mixing Test

- **Purpose:** To distinguish between factor deficiencies and circulating inhibitors in cases of abnormal coagulation results.
- **Procedure:**
  - The patient’s plasma is mixed in a 1:1 ratio with normal plasma.
  - **Interpretation of Results:**
	- **Correction of PT (Prothrombin Time):** Indicates a factor deficiency because the normal plasma supplies the missing factors.
	- **No Correction of PT:** Suggests the presence of a circulating inhibitor, as the inhibitor in the patient’s plasma continues to affect the normal plasma.
## The Effect of Anticoagulants on Clotting Tests
