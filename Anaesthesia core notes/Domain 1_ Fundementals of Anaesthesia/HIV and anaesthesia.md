## Common Abnormalities on Special Investigations

### Blood Tests

#### Liver Function Tests (LFTs)
- Hypoalbuminemia, raised liver enzymes, especially with nevirapine

#### Arterial Blood Gas Analysis
- Hyperlactataemia, lactic acidosis

#### Viral Load and CD4+ Count
- Mortality is inversely related to CD4+ count

### Radiology
#### Chest X-ray
- Cardiac shadow abnormalities (pericardial effusion), dilated cardiomyopathy, evidence of infection (bacterial pneumonia, PCP, TB), Kaposi's sarcoma of airway or mediastinum, mediastinal compression or lymphadenopathy

### ECG
- Conduction defects, prolonged QT time

## Different ARVs

### Transcription Inhibitors
#### NRTIs (Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)
- Competitive inhibitors: Nucleoside analogues that compete to be taken up into DNA & cause chain termination.
  - Examples: Lamivudine, Tenofovir, Emtricitabine, Stavudine, Zidovudine
  - Side Effects: Nausea & vomiting, bone marrow suppression, mitochondrial dysfunction (lipodystrophy, neuropathy, myopathy, raised lactate, pancreatitis).

#### NNRTIs (Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)
- Non-competitive inhibitors of reverse transcriptase.
  - Examples:
	- Rilpivirine
	- Efavirenz (Side Effect: neuropsychiatric effects)
	- Nevirapine (Side Effect: liver toxicity, Steven-Johnson syndrome)

### Protease Inhibitors
- Examples: Ritonavir & Lopinavir (always

 together)

  - Side Effects: Diabetes mellitus, dysmetabolic syndrome, lipodystrophy, hyperlipidaemia, diarrhea.

### Integrase Inhibitors
- Examples: Raltegravir (Isentress), Dolutegravir

### Entry Inhibitors
- Examples: Maraviroc, Enfuvirtide

## Children vs. Adults
- **Pulmonary Disease**: Leading cause of morbidity and mortality.
  - Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis (chronic lung disease) is more common in children.
- **Cardiac Abnormalities**: Present in both asymptomatic HIV infection and advanced AIDS.
- **Neurological Abnormalities**: Most children with HIV will have neurological abnormalities, including progressive encephalopathy with signs of developmental delay, progressive motor dysfunction, loss of milestones, and behavioral changes.
- **Opportunistic Infections of the CNS**: Less common in children than in adults.
- **Failure to Thrive**: Common in children due to chronic infectious diarrhea and mucocutaneous candidiasis.
- **Lymphadenopathy**: Common presenting feature.
- **Surgery**: Different types of surgery are required for children with HIV compared to adults.

### Pediatric ARV Drug Interactions
- **Pharmacokinetic Interactions**: Primarily due to liver enzyme induction or inhibition, particularly the CYP450 3A4 enzyme. Protease inhibitors (PIs) and NNRTIs are most commonly implicated.
  - **Opioids**:
	- Increased dosages with NNRTIs (increased metabolism)
	- Decreased dosages with PIs (decreased metabolism and clearance)
  - **Benzodiazepines**:
	- PIs may inhibit midazolam metabolism, requiring dose reduction.
	- NNRTIs can potentiate the effects of midazolam.
  - **Calcium Channel Blockers**: May have enhanced hypotensive effects due to enzyme inhibition.
  - **Local Anaesthetics**: May have increased plasma levels due to enzyme inhibition.
  - **Neuromuscular Blockers**: Effects may be prolonged.

## Approach to ARVs in the Perioperative Period
- **Full Pre-op Assessment**: Including staging, tests of relevant organ function, and CD4 count.
- **Continue ARVs Throughout Pre-op Fast**
- **Induction**: Etomidate preferred, but use caution in cases of adrenal insufficiency.
- **Inhalational Agents**: Theoretically, less metabolized agents such as Desflurane should be better.
- **Use Opiates with Caution**: Due to prolonged effects.
- **Cautious Use of NMBs**: Due to prolonged effects. Atracurium and Cisatracurium are not dependent on CYP450.

#### Contraindication to Tenofovir: Renal Disease
- **Regimen**: Zidovudine + Lamivudine + Efavirenez/Nevirapine.

### Interaction by Class of ARV

ARVs affect CYP3A4 and alter the duration of action of the following drugs:

- Midazolam, alprazolam, diazepam, zolpidem, fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, granisetron
- Antibiotics, metronidazole, warfarin, COCP, pethidine, amiodarone, statins

#### PIs
- Insulin resistance; Mostly inducers of CYP3A4 → drug interactions
  - ↓ Fentanyl clearance, Morphine safe
  - ↑ Pethidine metabolism → ↑ norpethidine → seizures
  - ↓ Midazolam metabolism → ↑ bioavailability
  - ↓ Digoxin, Amiodarone metabolism → ↑ levels
  - Statins contraindicated (Rhabdomyolysis, myopathies)
  - Metronidazole: Disulfiram-like reaction

#### NNRTIs
- Hepatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), inducers of CYP450
  - ↓ Plasma concentration of methadone, fentanyl, amiodarone, verapamil, diltiazem, COCP.
  - ↑ Warfarin effect → monitor INR!
  - Potentiates Midazolam.

#### Others
- **NRTIs**: Antibiotics, Metronidazole
- **NtRTIs**: Tenofovir is nephrotoxic
- **All Other Classes**: No significant interactions with anaesthetic drugs

## Needle Stick PEP
- **Regimen**: Tenofovir/emtricitabine 300mg/200mg daily PO + Atazanavir/ritonavir 300mg/100mg daily PO

## Anaesthesia for a Patient with HIV
### Position/Padding/Temperature
- Care if cachectic.

### Blood Products
- Evidence suggests giving blood can lead to transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM) = Increased HIV load. Only give if necessary.

### Drugs
- Continue HIV treatment perioperatively. Few options for parenteral ARVs.

### Drug Interactions
- Fentanyl's action is enhanced by ritonavir. Reduce dose.
- Midazolam may need dose reduction.
- Calcium channel blockers have an enhanced hypotensive effect with PIs.
- Neuromuscular blockers have a prolonged effect - use TO4.

### Immunocompromise
- Strict aseptic technique.

### Self-Protection
- Gloves, masks, glasses.
