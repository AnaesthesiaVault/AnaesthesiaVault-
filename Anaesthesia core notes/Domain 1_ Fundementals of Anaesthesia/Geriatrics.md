# Introduction

No clear definition of old age exists. Suggestions that age in proportion to local life expectancy in a specific population should be used have resulted in old age varying from above 45 to 75 in women and 55 to 75 in men. Generally, 65 is considered as aged in the normal working population while physiologically old age appears to be over 80.

# Pharmacologic Considerations in Elderly Patients

- **Dose Requirements and Sensitivity:**
	- Decreased dose requirements for IV anaesthetics.
	- Increased sensitivity to opioids.
	- Increased duration of neuromuscular blockers except cis-atracurium.
	- Avoid ketamine to reduce the risk of postoperative delirium.
	- Undesirable side effects from diphenhydramine, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, metoclopramide, NSAIDs, meperidine.
- **Volume of Distribution (Vd):**
	- Altered Vd due to increased fat, decreased muscle, and decreased total body water volume.
	- Results in lower volumes of distribution and higher plasma concentrations of hydrophilic drugs.
	- Increased fat and decreased muscle:
		- Muscle tissues are pharmacokinetically active with high blood flow and participate in the distribution of most anaesthetic drugs.
		- Fat tissues have lower blood flow but a high capacity to slowly absorb drugs, especially fat-soluble drugs.
		- Volumes of distribution of lipophilic drugs can be similar or higher in elderly patients compared with younger patients.
- **Metabolism and Excretion:**
	- Decreased hepatic metabolism due to reduced enzyme activity.
	- Decreased renal excretion due to decreased creatinine clearance (CrCl).
	- Reduced plasma proteins (albumin):
		- Causes significant changes in the unbound (and therefore active) fraction of highly protein-bound drugs.
	- Net result:
		- To achieve adequate plasma concentrations, initial doses should be similar to those used in younger patients but may take longer to reach the desired effect.
		- Effects are longer-lasting, so additional or top-up doses should be smaller and/or given at longer intervals.
- **Coexisting Disease:**
	- Coexisting diseases may affect pharmacokinetics directly or indirectly via interactions due to polypharmacy.

### Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)
- **Absorption:** Reduced
- **Metabolism:** Diminished
- **Distribution:** Altered by reduced cardiac output (CO), reduced body water, reduced serum albumin, increased fat
- **Elimination:** Diminished
- **Net Result:** Normal initial dose, smaller top-up doses
- **Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA):** Start low and go slow
- **Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC):** Decreased by 6% per decade after 40 years

### Consider Neuraxial Anesthesia over General Anesthesia (GA) to
- Decrease the risk of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).
- Reduce postoperative pulmonary complications.

## Cardiovascular System (CVS)
- Arrhythmias due to fibrosis of the conduction system.
- Decreased sympathetic drive resulting in reliance on preload.
- Reduced baroreceptor response.
- Diastolic dysfunction.
- Increased systolic blood pressure due to reduced arterial elasticity.
- Increased atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD).
- Decreased stroke volume due to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and narrowing of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT).
- Calcified valves causing prolonged ejection time and reduced diastole.

## Respiratory System
- Reduced chest wall compliance.
- Closing capacity exceeds functional residual capacity (FRC) in sitting position (>65 years), increasing work of breathing.
- Diminished hypoxic and hypercapnic response.
- Decreased lung volumes except residual volume (and FRC), which increase.
- Higher risk of chest infection due to reduced muscular strength, reduced cough, cilia degeneration, and microaspiration.
- Decreased PaO2 with age (0.3% per year).

## Renal System
- Reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood flow, tubular function, concentrating ability, and drug elimination.
- Reduced responsiveness to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
- Kidney dysfunction is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality.

## Hepatic System
- Decreased liver mass and blood flow.

## Gastrointestinal System (GIT)
- Potential for delayed gastric emptying and discoordinated gut motility.

## Nervous System
- Autonomic dysfunction.
- Perioperative confusion.
- Increased sensitivity to central nervous system (CNS) depressants.

## Metabolic
- Replacement of muscle by fat.

## Skin and Muscle
- Frailty and malnutrition.

## Thermoregulation
- Prone to hypothermia due to reduced metabolic rate and impaired thermoregulation.
# Anaesthesia for the Elderly

## Type of Surgery

### Day Case Surgery
- Requires a structured plan including home care and a readmission policy.
- Advantages:
  - Quicker return to familiar environments
  - Less confusion
  - Early mobilisation
  - Less exposure to hospital infections

### Emergency Surgery
- Patients are acutely ill with little time for optimisation.
- Greater risk of morbidity and mortality (up to twice that of elective surgery).
- Rapid evaluation and concurrent optimisation required, which may need to continue during surgery.

## Preoperative Considerations

- Increased postoperative morbidity and mortality
- Multiple associated comorbidities

### Special Investigations
- **Blood Tests:** RBC and U&E may show evidence of correctable conditions that can help in optimising organ function.
- **ECG:** More effective at detecting arrhythmias than ischaemia.
- **Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing:** Identifies those who may benefit from optimisation of their cardiac status, but implementation is problematic for urgent or emergent surgeries.

### Screening Tests
- **Dementia Screening:**
  - Aimed at preventing postoperative delirium and POCD.
  - Strategies include reduced anaesthetic doses and using BIS/EEG monitoring to titrate the minimum anaesthetic dose.

#### Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT)

The abbreviated mental test is simple, reproducible, and easy to use. A score of less than 7 out of 10 suggests cognitive impairment.

- Unintentional weight loss (at least 4 kg in the last year)
- Self-reported exhaustion
- Weak grip strength
- Slow walking speed
- Low physical activity

#### Frailty Criteria and Definitions

| Frailty Criteria          | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reduced muscle strength   | Weakness assessed by grip strength measured by a handheld dynamometer. Three attempts with the dominant hand are made. Mean is calculated and adjusted for gender and BMI. Weakness is defined as grip strength in the lowest 20th percentile of a community-dwelling population aged 65 years or older. |
| Unintentional weight loss | Weight loss of 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds) or more in the last 12 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Exhaustion                | Patient rates how often in the last week they felt everything they did was an effort or could not get going (0 = rarely, 1 = some of the time, 2 = moderate amount of time, 3 = most of the time). Score of 2 or 3 on either statement is defined as exhaustion.                                         |
| Low physical activity     | Assessed by a validated questionnaire. If below the 20th percentile for their gender, they are classified as having low physical activity.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Slow walking speed        | Patient is timed walking a distance of 4.5m (15 feet) three times. Average of the walks is calculated and adjusted for gender and height. If in the lowest 20th percentile, the patient is scored as a slow walker.                                                                                      |

### Prognostic Score Conditions

The Charlson comorbidity index predicts annual mortality associated with a combination of chronic comorbidities. Each condition is scored according to its mortality risk (i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 6). Age is added in some scores at a rate of 1 per decade after 40.

| Score | Condition |
| ----- | --------- |
| 1     | Myocardial infarct, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease, connective tissue disorder, peptic ulcer, liver disease, diabetes |
| 2     | Hemiplegia, moderate or severe kidney disease, diabetes with end organ damage, non-metastatic tumour, leukaemia, lymphoma |
| 3     | Moderate or severe liver disease |
| 6     | Metastatic tumour, AIDS |

#### Prognostic Score Interpretation

- Score < 3: Greater than 90% chance of 1-year survival.
- Score 3-8: 50-90% chance of survival.
- Score > 8: 50% chance of 1-year survival.

### Musculoskeletal Changes with Aging
- Predispose to increased risk of nerve, joint, and skin injury.
- Multiple comorbid conditions and potential for polypharmacy.

### General Principles

1. **Rapid Mobilisation:**
	- Associated with early discharge and reduced morbidity.
	- Use short-acting drugs, regional techniques, optimal fluid usage, optimised nutrition, and pain control.
	- Monitor depth of anaesthesia; prolonged deep anaesthesia is associated with poorer outcomes.

2. **Drug Doses:**
	- Drugs take longer to work due to slow arm/brain circulation, greater distribution, and slower elimination.
	- MAC is lower; give doses to effect, wait for them to work, and increase dosing interval. Adding ephedrine may speed up onset and reduce hypotension at induction.

3. **Fluids:**
	- Fluid balance is difficult to assess.
	- ADH is less effective; dehydration common in emergencies, bowel prepped, and malnourished.
	- Large fluid volumes may be poorly tolerated, especially in CCF, COAD, renal, or hepatic dysfunction.
	- Use goal-directed fluid administration with inotropic or vasopressor cardiovascular support as necessary.

4. **Analgesia:**
	- Regional techniques are beneficial but consider what to do when they wear off.
	- Opiates can cause confusion; NSAIDs worsen renal function and have gastric side effects. Intramuscular injections and topical patches are unpredictable.
	- Paracetamol IV or PO is a good mainstay.
	- Tramadol or an opioid PCA with easy-to-depress electronic buttons may be necessary.

5. **Thermoregulation:**
	- Decreased metabolic rate, minimal shivering, and impaired thermoregulation predispose to hypothermia and additional cardiovascular stress.
	- Use measures to keep them warm but watch for burns.

6. **Supplemental Oxygen:**
	- Evidence suggests 100% oxygen may be toxic; 60% is likely sufficient provided the saturations are fine.
	- Nasal cannulae are well tolerated but may cause sinusitis long-term as nasal mucosa dries out; keep flows at 2 L/min and monitor saturations.

7. **Pressure Points, Positioning, and Skin:**
	- Increased pressure sores with prolonged surgery due to hypoperfusion and delayed mobilisation.
	- Pad pressure points; use a bolster under Achilles tendons to lift heels off the bed.
	- Atherosclerosis can cause vertebrobasilar insufficiency; fractures can occur if osteoporotic.
	- Handle the neck carefully, especially in extension.
	- Handle skin lesions with care; watch adhesive tape and never pull sheets out from under the patient.

8. **High Care or ICU:**
	- Useful in frail patients with organ dysfunction, especially for emergency, prolonged, cavity-opening surgery, or fluid shifts.
	- Elderly patients can become confused by the noise, lights, lack of rest or sleep; discharge as soon as possible.

9. **Anticoagulation:**
	- Immobile elderly patients are at risk of DVT; anticoagulate from admission or as soon as possible.
	- Monitor for bleeding, especially with combinations or multiple anticoagulants.

10. **Mobilisation:**
	- Mobilise slowly, early, with physiotherapy help.

11. **Regular Medication:**
	- Continue or restart regular medication from the day of surgery.
	- Do not stop beta-blockers or statins for surgery.
	- Follow guidelines for antiplatelet drugs in patients with stents.

12. **Confusion:**
	- Not all confusion is delirium; investigate wound infections, pneumonia, UTI, DVT, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycaemia, hypoxia, alcohol withdrawal, and opiate administration.

13. **Blood Transfusion:**
	- Due to low iron stores, anaemia is common. Transfusion of >1000 ml of blood is a major contributor to early postoperative delirium.
	- Transfuse only if necessary; suggested triggers are Hb < 7 g/dL or < 8 g/dL with cardiac disease.

### Regional Vs General Anaesthesia

- **Regional Anaesthesia with Minimal Sedation:**
  - Revolutionised cataract surgery, making it possible for nonagenarians and centenarians.
  - Well tolerated in peripheral limb surgery with sedation and a block.
  - Spinal or epidural anaesthesia may reduce mortality in the first month of hip surgery (6.9% vs. 9.4%) but has no effect on overall mortality.
 - DVT rates are reduced with spinal or epidural anaesthesia (30% vs. 47%).
  - Insufficient data for regional blocks with or without general anaesthesia.
  - Neither technique appears to offer a survival benefit in major surgery.

## Postoperative Considerations

### Features of Pain in Elderly People

The British Pain Society has created a list of features of pain in elderly people.

#### Features

- **Autonomic changes:** Pallor, sweating, tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypertension.
- **Facial expressions:** Grimacing, wincing, frowning, rapid blinking, brow movements, eyelid tightening, nose wrinkling, lip puckering.
- **Body movements:** Altered gait, pacing, rocking, hand wringing, repetitive movements, increased tone.
- **Verbalizations:** Sighing, grunting, groaning, screaming, calling out, offensive speech.
- **Changes in interpersonal interactions:** Being either aggressive or withdrawn.
- **Changes in activity pattern:** Wandering or altered sleep and mental status changes such as confusion, distress, or irritability.

### Delirium

- Incidence of 0% to 73% postoperatively.
- Symptoms can last up to 6 months.
- Predictor for the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and is associated with increased risk of dementia, death, increased length of hospital stay, and readmission.
