### Minimal Sedation (formerly Known as anxiolysis)
- Drug-induced state during which patients respond normally to verbal commands.
- Although cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, respiratory and cardiovascular stability is unimpaired.

### Moderate Sedation (formerly Known as Conscious sedation)
- Drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation.
- Reflex response to a painful stimulus is not a purposeful response.
- No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation is adequate.
- Cardiovascular stability is usually maintained.

### Deep Sedation/Analgesia
- Drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot be easily roused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulus.
- Patients may require assistance in maintaining a patent airway and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate.
- Cardiovascular stability is usually maintained.
- In the UK, deep sedation is considered part of the spectrum of general anaesthesia.

## Consent
- Written
- Should contain:
	- Explanation of procedure
	- Proposed sedation technique
	- Risk/benefit
	- Alternative options
	- Sedation failure

## Goals
- Respect the rights of the patient at all times
- Reduce the patient’s fear, anxiety, and distress
- Minimize physical discomfort and pain
- Minimize psychological trauma
- Pose a minimal threat to the patient’s safety
- Allow the procedure to be accomplished safely, reliably, and effectively
- Maintain consciousness and patient cooperation
- Maintain control of the physiological parameter
- Return the patient to a state in which safe discharge is possible

## Contra-indications

### Absolute
- Abnormal airway including adenotonsillar hypertrophy causing obstruction to breathing when asleep (Obstructive Sleep Apnoea, or OSA), or any other anatomical abnormality of upper and lower airway.
- Raised intracranial pressure
- Depressed conscious level
- History of sleep apnoea
- Respiratory failure
- Cardiac failure
- Neuromuscular disease
- Bowel obstruction
- Active respiratory tract infection
- Known allergy to sedative drug/previous adverse reaction
- Child too distressed despite adequate preparation
- Older child with severe behavioural problems
- Refusal by the parent/guardian/child

### Relative
- Neonates, especially if premature or ex-premature
- Children with cardiovascular instability or impaired cardiac function
- Renal impairment
- Hepatic impairment
- Severe respiratory disease
- Gastro-oesophageal reflux
- Impaired bulbar reflexes
- Emergency cases who are not adequately starved
- Anticonvulsant therapy
- Children receiving opioids and other sedatives
- Children receiving drugs that potentiate the action of sedatives (e.g., macrolide antibiotics like erythromycin potentiate and prolong the sedative effects of midazolam)

## Patient Preparation
- Minimum Fasting Period NB
- SOAP ME for preparation

### SOAPME Checklist
- **Suction:** Size-appropriate suction catheters and a functioning suction apparatus (e.g., Yankauer-type suction)
- **Oxygen:** Adequate oxygen supply and functioning flow meters/other devices to allow its delivery
- **Airway:** Size-appropriate airway equipment (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal airways, laryngoscope blades [checked and functioning], tracheal tubes, stylets, face mask, bag-valve-mask or equivalent device [functioning])
- **Pharmacy:** All the basic drugs needed to support life during an emergency, including antagonists as indicated
- **Monitors:** Functioning pulse oximeter with size-appropriate oximeter probes and other monitors as appropriate for the procedure (e.g., non-invasive blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide, ECG, stethoscope)
- **Equipment:** Special equipment or drugs for a particular case (e.g., defibrillator)

### Fasting
- Controversial:
	- Airway reflexes are assumed to be maintained during moderate and minimal sedation.
	- Simple/standard sedation = fasting is recommended but not mandatory
	- Advanced techniques and deep sedation (inc non-dissociative) = Standard anaesthetic fasting guidelines

## Monitoring Requirements

### Basic/Standard Sedation
- With minimal sedation/anxiolysis for < 30min: Clinical monitoring (level of sedation, anxiety, pallor, breathing pattern) ± intermittent vitals

### Advanced Sedation
- **Clinical:**
	- Anxiety levels and behaviour
	- LOC and depth of sedation
	- Pain/discomfort
	- Airway patency
	- Oxygenation and colour
	- Breathing, RR, ventilation
- **Electronic (minimum standards):**
	- ASA I and II: SpO₂ and NIBP
	- Fragile ASA II's and deep sedation: SpO₂, NIBP, ECG, Capnography

#### Basic Vs Advanced
- **Simple/standard:** Single agent, not an IV induction agent (e.g. N₂O, midazolam, oral transmucosal, or rectal drugs)
- **Advanced:** Combination of drugs, IV sedation, inhalational (other than N₂O), TCI techniques

## Documentation

**Before:**
- Consent
- Medical history questionnaire
- Pre-sedation instructions
- Cover letter to the parent
- Pre-procedural checklist

**During:** Monitoring flow chart

**After:** Post-sedation monitoring chart; post-sedation instructions

## Personnel

**Simple sedation effecting minimal sedation/anxiolysis for < 30min**
- Operator-sedationist
- Assistant to monitor patient

**All other procedures**
- Operator
- Assistant to the procedure
- Dedicated sedationist

*Intercollegiate Advisory Committee for Sedation in Dentistry allows moderate sedation, provided the assistant can help if complications occur*

### Dedicated Vs Operational Sedationist

- **Dedicated:** Deal only with sedation aspect
- **Operator:** Performs sedation and procedure.
	- Only simple sedation with minimal sedation and anxiolysis outcomes.
	- Another person must be available to clinically monitor the patient while the procedure is performed.
	- If an inadvertent depth of sedation occurs, an observer (equivalent to nurse training level) must be available to monitor the observation and maintain patency of airway.
# Drugs

### Sedative Agents: Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Midazolam
- **Advantages:**
	- Short acting
	- Sedative, anxiolytic, amnestic, anti-convulsant
	- Synergistic with other depressants
- **Disadvantages:**
	- 15% have a paradoxical response
	- Loss of airway muscle tone at high doses
	- Cardio-respiratory depression is possible

#### Propofol
- **Advantages:**
	- Short acting
	- Rapid onset and offset
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Deep sedation, airway obstruction, and apnea occur rapidly and unpredictably
	- Pain on injection 90% of the time
	- Prolonged infusions → Metabolic Acidosis (can be fatal)

#### Ketamine
- **Advantages:**
	- Cardiovascular stability
	- Analgesic, sedative, amnestic
	- Preservation of airway reflexes and tone
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Non-purposeful movements may occur
	- ↑ Secretions
	- Emergence delirium
	- Sympathomimetic → ↑ BP, HR

#### Dexmedetomidine (Dex)
- **Advantages:**
	- Sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic, sympatholytic
	- No respiratory effects → airway + ventilation maintained
	- Rousable sedation
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Interferes with thermoregulation
	- Transient hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, and arrest can occur especially during loading dose

## Benzodiazepines

### Midazolam
- **Effects:** Anxiolysis, sedation, and amnesia
- **Doses:**
	- **Oral:** 0.5 mg/kg (maximum 20 mg, 30 min beforehand) reduces crying during induction of anaesthesia, but occasionally dizziness, dysphoria, and paradoxical reactions occur. Its bitter taste needs masking with a sweetening agent.
	- **Intranasal drops or sublingual:** 0.2 mg/kg
	- **Rectal:** 0.3–1 mg/kg
	- **IV titration:** 0.05–0.2 mg/kg
- **Reversal:** Flumazenil 20-30 µg/kg

## Barbiturates

### Propofol
- **Dose:** Sedation is induced by 2–4 mg/kg and usually maintained by an infusion of 6–8 mg/kg/h

## Opioids

### Morphine
- **Use:** Useful for painful procedures such as wound care
- **Dose:** 60 µg/kg IV has been used in combination with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV without major respiratory effects

### Fentanyl
- **Dose:** 1–6 µg/kg
- **Reversal:** Naloxone 10 µg/kg IV, repeated as necessary

## Tranquillizers

### Trimeprazine
- **Dose:** 3–4 mg/kg orally
- **Note:** Because of reports of hypotension, the maximum recommended dose is 2 mg/kg. At this dose, it can be combined with morphine 0.2 mg/kg IM for sedation of children >15 kg for MRI

### Chlorpromazine and Promethazine

## Nitrous Oxide

### Nitrous Oxide
- Provides valuable analgesia and sedation in cooperative children for a wide variety of painful procedures.
- Loss of consciousness can occur when combined with other sedatives or when used alone in concentrations over 50%

### Ketamine
- **Doses:**
	- **IM:** 4 mg/kg
	- **Oral:** 5-10 mg/kg (wait 10-20 min). Can take 2 hours to recover
	- **IV:** 0.15-0.2 mg/kg

# Sedation in Outpatient Settings
- A stand-alone operator-sedationist may only use basic/standard sedation techniques, effecting minimal sedation/anxiolysis, for < 30 min.
- Concomitant use of simple analgesia is permissible.
- A second person must monitor the patient and help with rescue if needed. Clinical monitoring ± recording of intermittent vitals is sufficient for this level.
- Only ASA I / II patients are suitable for out-of-theatre sedation.
- Fasting is recommended, but not mandatory.

**Basic/Standard sedation is defined as:**
- Oral, transmucosal, or rectal drugs e.g., benzodiazepines
- N₂O ≤ 50%
- Titrated IV midazolam up to 0.1 mg/kg
- Any combining of drugs via any route (including the above), IV drugs (besides midazolam ≤ 0.1 mg/kg), or N₂O > 50% is classified as advanced sedation

# SASA

## Safe Sedation Guidelines

### Sedation Safety and Best Practices
- Appropriate patient selection and evaluation, with emphasis on a focused airway examination.
- Only ASA I and II patients qualify for sedation outside the operating theatre.
- Knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs.
- Administration of the minimal dose of drug necessary to make the patient safe and comfortable. This dose must have taken full effect before any additional dose is administered. The use of fixed doses or boluses is not recommended.
- Trained sedation practitioner, support staff, and facilities meeting the requirements for safe practice.
- Sedation practitioners must be able to manage, rescue, and recover a patient who enters a deeper than intended level of sedation.

# ICU Sedation

## CCM 2018 Guidelines
1. Light sedation in mechanically ventilated adults
2. Daily sedative interruption and nursing-protocolized-targeted sedation can achieve and maintain a light level of sedation
3. Propofol > Benzodiazepines for ventilated patients after cardiac surgery
4. Propofol/Dexmedetomidine both > Benzodiazepines for non-cardiac patients
5. BIS is best suited for sedative titration in deeply sedated or neuromuscular blockaded patients
## RASS
### Richmond Agitation & Sedation Scale (RASS)

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|+4|Combative: Violent, immediate danger to staff|
|+3|Very agitated: Pulls at or removes tubes, aggressive|
|+2|Agitated: Frequent non-purposeful movements, fights ventilator|
|+1|Restless: Anxious, apprehensive but movements not aggressive or vigorous|
|0|Alert & calm|
|-1|Drowsy: Not fully alert, sustained awakening to voice (eye opening & contact >10 secs)|
|-2|Light sedation: Briefly awakens to voice (eye opening & contact < 10 secs)|
|-3|Moderate sedation: Movement or eye-opening to voice (no eye contact)|
|-4|Deep sedation: No response to voice, but movement or eye opening to physical stimulation|
|-5|Un-rousable: No response to voice or physical stimulation|

**RASS ≥ -2:** Proceed to CAM-ICU assessment.  
**RASS < -2:** Stop, recheck later.

## ABCDEF Bundle for ICU Liberation

- **A - Assess:** Prevent and manage pain (pain scores, regional anaesthesia, and non-opioid adjuncts, recommendation for analgesia-based sedation using fentanyl).
- **B - Both:** Spontaneous awakening and spontaneous breathing trials.
- **C - Choice:** Choice of sedation (targeting light sedation, avoiding benzodiazepines, recommendation for dexmedetomidine if high risk for delirium, post-cardiac surgery, or during weaning from mechanical ventilation).
- **D - Delirium:** Routine delirium monitoring and management (CAM-ICU or ICDSC assessments, nonpharmacological intervention, dexmedetomidine, or antipsychotic if hyperactive symptoms).
- **E - Early Mobilisation:** Early mobilisation and exercise. Early mobilisation reduces ICU delirium and impacts physical function and quality of life.
- **F - Family:** Family engagement and empowerment (participation in multidisciplinary rounds, cognitive stimulation, and participation in mobilisation).
## Naloxone Infusion Protocol

### Naloxone Dosing and Administration

#### Adult Dose

- **IV Bolus:** 400-2000 micrograms given by slow IV injection (over 3-5 minutes), repeated at intervals of 2 to 3 minutes, up to 10mg. If a total of 10mg is given with no satisfactory response, then the diagnosis should be questioned.

#### IV Infusion (Unlicensed Concentration)

- The initial hourly rate for infusion (second column) is set at 60% of the bolus needed to obtain a response and may be adjusted according to clinical response.

|Initial Bolus Dose Giving Response|Initial Hourly Rate of Infusion|Volume per Hour (of 200 micrograms/mL solution)|
|---|---|---|
|400 micrograms|240 micrograms/hour|1.2 mL/hour|
|600 micrograms|360 micrograms/hour|1.8 mL/hour|
|800 micrograms|480 micrograms/hour|2.4 mL/hour|
|1000 micrograms|600 micrograms/hour|3.0 mL/hour|
|1200 micrograms|720 micrograms/hour|3.6 mL/hour|
|1400 micrograms|840 micrograms/hour|4.2 mL/hour|
|1600 micrograms|960 micrograms/hour|4.8 mL/hour|
|1800 micrograms|1080 micrograms/hour|5.4 mL/hour|
|2000 micrograms|1200 micrograms/hour|6.0 mL/hour|

**Presentation:** Naloxone is stocked at RBCH in 400 micrograms/mL injections and 800 micrograms/2mL Min-I-jets.
