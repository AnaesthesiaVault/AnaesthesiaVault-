# Pre-op Assessment for Elective Surgery

## Objectives
- Identifying latent pathology requiring treatment
- Optimizing pre-existing medical conditions
- Ensuring appropriate preoperative investigations are arranged
- Promoting lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, weight loss, alcohol reduction
- Streamlining day-of-surgery admission
- Reducing day-of-surgery cancellations
- Highlighting high-risk or challenging patients to the appropriate anaesthetic team
- Discussion of anaesthetic techniques prior to admission

## History and Examination
- Aim of identifying medical co-morbidities and the functional effect of the conditions.
- Previous anaesthetic history should be taken and ideally previous anaesthetic records should be examined to identify any problems related to anaesthesia or airway management.
- A family history of any significant problems with anaesthesia should be sought, including malignant hyperthermia and suxamethonium apnoea.
- Risk factors for gastro-oesophageal reflux should be identified; these include hiatus hernia, a history of reflux, and medical conditions which may delay gastric emptying.
- Appropriate plans for airway management can then be formulated and antacid prophylaxis prescribed.
- A review of all regular medications should be undertaken and the patient should be instructed as to which drugs to continue or withhold in the peri-operative period.
- A general physical examination should reveal any abnormalities such as obesity, scoliosis, and flexor contractions which may have implications for positioning while under anaesthesia.
- A cardiovascular and respiratory examination should be performed to confirm the presence of cardiac murmurs, dysrhythmias, and lung pathologies.

## Airway Assessment
### Predictors of Difficulty with BMV Include
- Obesity (neck circumference >60 cm)
- Beard
- Edentulous
- Snoring
- Anatomical facial abnormality

### Predictors of Difficult Laryngoscopy Include
- **Inter-incisor gap**
  - Mouth opening is vital for most airway interventions.
  - The ability to open less than 3 cm is regarded as a sign of potential difficulty.
- **Mallampati Scoring System**
  - This assesses the view of the oropharynx.
  - Sit in front of the patient and ask them to open their mouth maximally and protrude their tongue whilst observing the view.
  - Class 3 and 4 can be associated with difficult laryngoscopy.

### Mallampati Scoring System

| Class | Structures Visible                      |
| ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Faucial pillars, soft palate, and uvula |
| 2     | Uvula tip masked by base of tongue      |
| 3     | Visualization of base of uvula only     |
| 4     | Soft palate not visible                 |

- **Thyromental distance**
  - This is the distance from the upper border of the thyroid cartilage to the tip of the jaw and is measured with the head extended.
  - A distance of less than 6.5 cm can be associated with a difficult view at laryngoscopy.
  - Traditionally measured with finger breadths, with a distance of less than three finger widths being associated with a poor view at laryngoscopy.
  - Recommended to be measured accurately with a ruler to avoid subjective results.
- **Jaw protrusion**
  - Assesses temporomandibular joint movement.
  - Patients can be asked to protrude their lower jaw or to ‘bite your upper lip’.
  - Inability to protrude the lower jaw can be associated with a poor view at laryngoscopy.
- **Neck movement**
  - Examines the patient’s ability to achieve the optimal position for airway management, both for intubation and mask ventilation.
  - The ‘sniffing position’ is achieved by cervical flexion and atlanto-axial extension.
  - With the neck fully flexed, the patient should be able to lift their head more than 15 degrees, demonstrating normal occipito-axial movement.
- **Dentition**
  - Presence of any loose teeth, prominent teeth including single maxillary incisors, dentures, and any loose dental work.

### Scoring Systems
#### Wilson's Score
- A scoring system assessing multiple components of airway assessment:
  - Obesity
  - Restricted head and neck movements
  - Restricted mandibular movements
  - Receding mandible
  - Prominent upper incisors
- Risk factors are assigned a score of 0, 1, or 2, with a score greater than 2 predicting more than 75% of difficult intubations.
- Scoring systems have an increased positive predictive value compared with single tests but have a high incidence of false-positives.

## Medical Co-morbidities
### Hypertension
- Increased risk of an exaggerated fall in systolic blood pressure on induction of anaesthesia (especially in uncontrolled hypertension) and an exaggerated sympathetic response to stresses such as laryngoscopy and pain.
  - Can potentially precipitate myocardial ischaemia and cerebrovascular accidents.
- Review for end-organ damage and control.
- Review ECG.
- Treatment of hypertension returns vascular reactivity towards normal levels, improving cardiovascular stability in the peri-operative period. Patients with severe hypertension (diastolic BP >110 mmHg) require control prior to elective surgery.

### Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)
- Well-controlled, stable angina need not delay elective surgery.
- Unstable angina, which occurs at rest, or angina increasing in frequency or severity, may require further investigation and cardiologist review to optimize medical treatment.

### Myocardial Infarction
- Patients who have had a recent myocardial infarction need a thorough discussion of the risks of surgery with both the anaesthetic and surgical teams.
- Recommendations suggest waiting more than 60 days before undergoing elective surgery following a medically managed myocardial infarction, with risks decreasing over time.

#### Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
- Elective non-cardiac surgery should be:
  - Delayed 14 days after balloon angioplasty.
  - Delayed 30 days after bare metal stent (BMS) insertion.
  - Optimally delayed 1 year after drug-eluting stent (DES) insertion.
- Elective non-cardiac surgery should not be performed in patients where dual antiplatelet therapy will need to be discontinued perioperatively within 30 days of BMS implantation or 12 months after DES insertion due to increased risk of in-stent thrombosis.

### Valvular Heart Disease
- Valvular heart lesions significantly increase cardiac risk.
- Patients with suspected moderate or severe valvular stenosis or regurgitation should have a preoperative echocardiogram if there hasn't been one in the past year or if there has been a significant change in clinical status or physical examination since the previous echocardiogram.

### Implantable Cardiac Devices
- Cardiac pacemakers are used in the presence of an abnormal cardiac conduction system.
- Devices are categorized by a code (chambers paced, chambers sensed, response to sensing, rate modulation, multisite pacing).
  - O = none, A = atrium, V = ventricle, D = dual, I = inhibited, R = rate modulation.
- Devices are checked annually, and results should be reviewed, focusing on percentage paced and underlying rhythm.
- Increasing use of left ventricular assist devices and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) for end-stage heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias.
- ICDs need to be deactivated for surgery; liaison with cardiology should begin early in the pre-assessment process.

### Stroke
- Patients with cerebrovascular disease are at risk of further events peri-operatively and may be intolerant of swings in blood pressure.
- Detailed account of pre-existing neurological impairment should be noted.
- Little evidence available to guide decisions regarding optimal timing of elective surgery following a stroke. Risks are most elevated in the first three months but remain elevated beyond this period. A balance of risks should be considered.

### COPD
- Severity of airflow limitation classified by FEV1 % predicted:
  - Mild: >80%
  - Moderate: 50-79%
  - Severe: 30-49%
  - Very severe: <30%
- Increasing severity is associated with higher risk of postoperative respiratory complications.
- Full history is essential, focusing on functional status (e.g., "how many stairs can you climb before stopping to catch your breath?").
- Details on the frequency and timing of exacerbations, steroid use, hospital admissions, and previous ventilation needs.
- Consider presence of pulmonary hypertension in long-standing COPD patients.
- Smoking increases the risk of postoperative complications; cessation advice should be given early, with maximum benefit seen if stopped at least 8 weeks before surgery.

#### Pre-op Wheeze Management
- Active treatment with bronchodilators.
- Consider presence of respiratory tract infection (RTI).
- Duration of treatment is unclear.
- Decision made in context with patient's severity and urgency of operation.
- Use of perioperative steroids is also unclear.

### Respiratory Tract Infection
- Patients with symptoms and signs of lower respiratory tract infection on the day of surgery should be treated and postponed until symptom-free.
- Viral upper respiratory tract infection can cause bronchial reactivity persisting for 3-4 weeks. Unless urgent, such patients should be postponed for 4 weeks to minimize postoperative respiratory infection risk.

### Diabetes
- Diabetic patients are at higher risk of medical and surgical adverse events, including cardiac and septic complications.
- Assess diabetic control through sugar levels and HbA1c.
  - If HbA1c >69 mmol/mol (8.5%) or patients have hypoglycaemic unawareness, consider referral to diabetic services.
- Consider underlying complications such as renal impairment and latent cardiac disease.
- Strategy for perioperative diabetic control should be established at the pre-assessment clinic (PAC) appointment.
  - Diabetic patients should ideally be first on the surgery list and promptly return to normal oral intake and usual diabetic regimen.

 Follow NHS Diabetes guidelines for perioperative management of diabetic patients undergoing elective surgery, stressing the need for a coordinated patient pathway.

### Obesity
- Obesity, a significant public health issue, is of particular relevance to anaesthetic practice due to associated co-morbidities:
  - Diabetes, CAD, gastro-oesophageal reflux, difficult airway, sleep apnoea, challenges with regional anaesthesia.
- The Society for Obesity and Bariatric Anaesthesia (SOBA) provides guidelines for the bariatric patient (BMI >35 kg/m2) including preoperative evaluation and recommendations for preoperative continuous positive airway pressure.

### Anaemia
- Anaemia limits tissue oxygenation and is poorly tolerated in patients with CAD or ventricular failure.
- Anaemia is a strong predictor of adverse surgical outcomes. If identified at the PAC, categorize iron deficiency anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease, or primary haematological cause.
  - Unexpected iron deficiency should be investigated to exclude malignancy.
  - Decision on surgery based on priority and anaemia severity.
  - Commence iron replacement therapy in parallel with investigations.

### Frailty
- Increasingly common with an ageing population.
- No standard method to measure frailty, various research tools available.
  - Factors include low muscle mass and cognitive decline.
  - Recent weight loss or nutritional concerns should generate a dietetic service referral.
- Preoperative exercise and strengthening evidence is limited.
- Issues of capacity and consent should be explored before admission.

### Rheumatoid Arthritis
- Multisystem inflammatory disorder with many anaesthetic implications.
- Significant cervical spine or temporomandibular joint involvement may require awake intubation technique.
- Severe disease may include pericardial effusions, pulmonary fibrosis, and renal impairment.
- Often associated with anaemia of chronic disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use.
- Medication protocols should be in place in consultation with the rheumatology service.
- Skin fragility and chronic pain management should be considered, and medications should ideally be continued perioperatively.
# Functional Assessment
## American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification

- The American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) scoring system was devised in 1963 for the standardized reporting of preoperative functional status.
- This consists of five categories, with a sixth added later (Table 2).
- The ASA classification is widely used, although should not be used as a stratification tool.
- The ASA grade is often criticized for a high rate of inter-observer variability and uses no information regarding the proposed surgical intervention.
- A suffix ‘E’ is used for emergency surgery.

### Problems with ASA
- Subjective
- Lots of user variability (especially in specific patient groups - obstetrics and paediatrics)
- Incomplete assessment of the patients statuscan be combined with other scores to generate prediction of patient outcome (e.g. NSQIP)
- No assessment of functional capacity.
- In trauma patients there is no indication of their current state, other than the designation "E". Which could reflect an stable pt with an open fracture or a patient who is periarrest.

## Metabolic Equivalents (METs)

- Functional status can be used as a predictor of perioperative events.
- Metabolic equivalents allow estimation of an individual’s functional capacity.
- One metabolic equivalent is the resting oxygen consumption of a 40-year-old 70-kg man (3.5 ml kg/min).
- Simplified MET score systems using routine activities are available and should be used in preoperative assessment (Figure 1).
- In general, perioperative cardiac risks are increased in patients with a MET lower than 4.
- It must be remembered that this score is subjective and patients may overestimate or underestimate their exercise tolerance.
### Simplified MET Score System

1. Walking around at home
2. Eating/Dressing
3. 200 yards on flat ground
4. 1 flight of stairs
5. 1 flight of stairs (continued)
6. Brisk walking
7. 2 flights of stairs
8. Jogging
9. Jogging (continued)
10. Brisk swimming
## Risk Assessment
### Surgery Grade

|Grade|Example|
|---|---|
|Grade 1 (minor)|Excision of skin lesion, drainage of breast abscess|
|Grade 2 (intermediate)|Knee arthroscopy, primary inguinal hernia repair, excision varicose veins|
|Grade 3 (major)|Total abdominal hysterectomy, endoscopic resection of prostate, lumbar discectomy, thyroidectomy|
|Grade 4 (major complex)|Thoracic surgery, colonic resection, radical neck dissection, elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair|

### Cardiac risk
- Revised Cardiac Risk Index.
	- high-risk type of surgery (supra-inguinal vascular, intraperitoneal or intrathoracic surgery)
	- history of ischaemic heart disease
	- history of congestive heart failure
	- history of cerebrovascular disease (stroke or transient ischaemic attack)
	- insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus
	- preoperative serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl.
### Predicted Risk of Cardiac Complications Using the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)

|Number of Risk Factors Present|Rate of Cardiac Complications (%)|
|---|---|
|0|0.5|
|1|1.0|
|2|5.0|
|3|10.0|
|4|15.0|

# Pre-operative Testing

## Electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Indicated for patients with a history of cardiovascular disease such as CAD, arrhythmia, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, or structural heart disease.
- Consider in asymptomatic patients with no history of CAD if undergoing intermediate or high-risk surgery.
- Not required in patients with no history of CAD undergoing low-risk surgery.

## Echocardiogram
- To assess left ventricular (LV) function if patients are known to have LV dysfunction and no echocardiogram has been performed within a year.
- For patients with known heart failure with increasing dyspnoea or a change in their clinical status.
- Reasonable to perform preoperative evaluation of LV function in patients with dyspnoea of unknown cause.
- For patients with clinically suspected moderate or greater degrees of valvular stenosis or regurgitation if there has been no echocardiogram within 1 year or a significant change in clinical status or physical examination since their last echocardiogram.

## Exercise Tolerance Test
- Consider in patients with increased risk and unknown functional capacity if it will change management.
- Consider in patients with increased risk and poor/unknown functional capacity along with cardiac imaging to assess for myocardial ischaemia.
- Not indicated for patients with increased risk if they have moderate to excellent functional capacity (>4-10 METs).

### Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET)
- CPET offers a global assessment of a patient’s cardiorespiratory response to exercise.
- Provides information regarding oxygen consumption at the onset of anaerobic metabolism (AT, anaerobic threshold), aiding risk stratification and management strategy planning.
- CPET is not widely available and there is uncertainty regarding the optimal CPET-derived variables and thresholds to use.
- Consider CPET in patients for high-risk procedures where functional capacity is unknown.
## Disease-Specific Approach to Preoperative Special Investigations

|Patient Criteria|Investigations|
|---|---|
|Active, no documented medical illness, no medications|Finger prick Hb only|
|Hypertension|Formal Hb, Creatinine, Na/K if using digoxin, diuretics, ACEIs or ARBs, ECG|
|Diabetes|Formal Hb, Finger prick glucose in all, HBA1C, Creatinine, Na/K if using digoxin, diuretics, ACEIs or ARBs|
|Ischemic Heart Disease|Formal Hb, Creatinine, Na/K if using digoxin, diuretics, ACEIs or ARBs, ECG. Decision to perform an echo (formal or screening) should be decided on a case by case basis in consultation with an Anaesthetist|
|Heart Failure|Formal Hb, Creatinine, Na/K if using digoxin, diuretics, ACEIs or ARBs, ECG. Decision to perform an echo (formal or screening) should be decided on a case by case basis in consultation with an Anaesthetist|
|Respiratory Disease: Well controlled, compliant, asymptomatic|Nil|
|Respiratory Disease: Poorly controlled/uncharacterized dyspnea or exercise intolerance that is unexplainable, Symptomatic COPD or asthma, Admission for respiratory aetiology or oral steroid use in last year|Lung function tests|

## Fasting
- Prolonged fasting should be avoided as this is associated with dehydration, increased postoperative nausea and vomiting, electrolyte imbalance and patient distress.
- Local fasting guidelines should be referred to at the pre-assessment visit and the patient clearly informed, reinforced with written instructions.
- In general clear fluids should be encouraged up to 2 hours preoperatively. Patients undergoing surgery within an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) programme are allowed clear carbohydrate-loading drinks 2 hours prior to induction of anaesthesia.
## Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prophylaxis
- A prophylaxis strategy should then be recommended. This should include both pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods where appropriate.
## Antiplatelet Medication
- Clopidogrel should be stopped 7 days prior to surgery and conversion to aspirin should be considered in patients with high cardiac risk
## Anticoagulation
- In patients receiving oral anticoagulation bleeding risk must be balanced against the benefit of continuing anticoagulant therapy.
- Patients with prosthetic valves or recurrent thrombo-embolic events who are taking warfarin therapy require bridging therapy with either low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin.
- Factor Xa inhibitors (e.g. rivaroxaban) cannot be reversed and in the elective setting should be withheld for 48 hours.
