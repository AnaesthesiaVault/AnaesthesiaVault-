# Approach to Any Emergency

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311160330.png)

# Emergency Evacuation

**Anaesthetised or sedated patient requires unplanned transfer because of environmental hazard (e.g., flood, fire, smoke, structural collapse, noxious gas).**

## Start

1. **Evaluate Safety:** Determine if the patient can be safely moved. If not, see Box A.
2. **Cease Procedures:** Stop any operative procedure as soon as safe. Pack and cover wounds.
3. **Transfer Patient:** Transfer patient to bed or trolley. Operate on the table in extremis.
4. **Evacuate Non-Essential Staff:** Consider calling for help but be aware their safety may preclude attendance.
5. **Airway Management:** Consider tracheal intubation to improve airway security if time allows.
6. **Breathing/Ventilation Options:**
	- Minimise oxygen usage: use the lowest flows possible.
	- Use a self-inflating bag with or without supplemental oxygen.
	- Use a mechanical ventilator or C-circuit which require higher flows.
7. **Circulation Management:**
	- Ensure adequacy and security of intravenous access.
	- Take adequate supplies of fluid and infusion sets.
	- Use vasopressors and/or resuscitation drug box.
8. **Maintenance of Anaesthesia:**
	- Intermittent bolus of propofol is the simplest and quickest method.
	- Infusion if time allows–remember mains cable for pump if available.
	- Consider taking stocks and pump to make infusion later.
	- Take blankets and/or warming devices if possible.
9. **Drug Assembly:** If time allows, assemble an adequate supply of drugs (see Box B).
10. **Monitor and Power:** Take existing monitoring and mains cabling.
11. **Communication:** Agree and communicate staff and patient muster points (see Box C).

### Box A: Unable to Move Patient

- Ensure adequate depth of anaesthesia.
- Ensure adequate reserve: 100% oxygen, low flow, fill vaporiser.
- Ensure adequate neuromuscular blockade if relevant.
- Evacuate all staff, including anaesthetist when indicated.
- Inform rescue services and theatre coordinator.

### Box B: Drugs

- **Aim to take:**
	- Oxygen
	- Propofol/other hypnotic
	- Neuromuscular blockade
	- Vasopressor(s)
	- Analgesics
	- IV fluids
	- Neuromuscular reversal if extubation anticipated

### Box C: Muster Point

- **Able-bodied:** Move to an adjacent safe zone.
- **Anaesthetised/Sedated patient:** Move to an area with appropriate access to oxygen and medications, e.g., theatre, recovery, or critical care area in a safe zone.
- Inform rescue services and relevant coordinator of location.

### Box D: Route

- Ensure route avoids the original hazard and any consequent ones.
- Exercise caution using lifts, especially in a fire.

### Anaphylaxis Vs Anaphylactoid Reactions

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311100629.png)

### Pathogenesis

Anaphylaxis is a Type I hypersensitivity reaction.

#### Immunologic (IgE Dependent)

- **Initial exposure to antigen (Ag) (sensitization):**
	- APCs present Ag to T_H cells.
	- T_H cells stimulate B-cells to differentiate into plasma cells & produce IgE against Ag.
	- IgE binds to FcεRI receptors on mast cells, sensitizing them to the Ag.
	- On re-exposure, Ag causes cross-linkage of IgE/FcεRI on mast cells.

#### Immunologic (IgE Independent)

- **Ag-Ab complexes:**
	- Indirect complement activation.
- **Direct complement activation:**
	- Generation of anaphylatoxins (complement peptides C3a, C4a, C5a).
- **Common Triggers:**
	- **Foods:** Insect stings/bites, latex.
	- **Drugs:** Penicillin, NSAIDs, ACEi, radiocontrast dye.
	- **Exercise and Environment:** Heat/cold, sunlight.

#### Non-immunologic (Physical Stimuli)

- Triggers can include exercise and environmental factors.

### Mechanism

#### Immediate Phase (Seconds-Minutes)

- **Mast Cell Degranulation:**
	- Release of preformed mediators such as:
		- **Histamine**
		- **Lipid Mediators:** Prostaglandins, leukotrienes.
		- **Other Mediators:** PAF, tryptase, TNF.

#### Late Phase (Minutes-Hours)

- **Additional Production of Inflammatory Mediators:**
	- Cytokines, chemokines.

### Inflammatory Mediators' Effects

- **Vasodilation**
- **Increased Vascular Permeability**
- **Smooth Muscle Contraction in Airways**
- **Increased Mucus Secretion**
- **Recruitment of Inflammatory Cells**
- **ANS Activation**

### Result

- **Anaphylaxis:** A systemic life-threatening allergic hypersensitivity response.
### Investigations

#### Tryptase
- **Timing:**
  - Taken within 60-120 minutes, using a red top tube.
  - Baseline level: 2 days post-reaction.
- **ISPAR Group Recommendations:**
  - 1st sample: 1 hour post-onset.
  - 2nd sample: 2-4 hours post-onset.
  - Baseline: > 24 hours post-onset.
- **Abnormal Increase:**
  - Peak tryptase is more than \[(1.2 x baseline tryptase) + 2 ng/mL\].
  - A level > 11.4 ng/mL is diagnostic.

#### Skin Testing
- **Intradermal**
- **Skin Prick Tests**

#### Blood Test
- **RAST (Radioallergosorbent Test):**
  - Patient's serum is exposed to the drug in vitro.
  - Highly specific but has low sensitivity.

#### Drug Provocation Tests
- Conducted under controlled conditions to confirm a drug allergy.

### Types of Hypersensitivity Reactions

#### Type 1: Anaphylactic Immediate Type
- **Mechanism:**
  - Requires prior exposure.
  - Antigen binds to IgE on mast cells, causing degranulation and release of mediators such as histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and bradykinin.
- **Response:** Can be biphasic.
- **Manifestations:**
  - Local (e.g., asthma, hay fever).
  - Systemic (e.g., anaphylaxis).

#### Type 2: Cytotoxic
- **Mechanism:**
  - Antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxic sensitivity reaction.
  - Mediated by IgM and IgG binding to a cell surface antigen.
  - Results in complement activation, opsonization (phagocytosis), and mobilization of NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils.
- **Examples:**
  - Hemolytic reactions.
  - Myasthenia gravis.
  - Rheumatic fever.

#### Type 3: Immune Complex-Mediated Reaction
- **Mechanism:**
  - Deposition of antigen-antibody complexes in host tissues causes tissue damage.
- **Examples:**
  - Farmer's lung.
  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

#### Type 4: Delayed Hypersensitivity
- **Mechanism:**
  - Cell-mediated.
  - Antigen binds to T lymphocytes, leading to cytokine release and activation of cytotoxic T cells and macrophages.
- **Examples:**
  - Tuberculosis (TB) walled off in a granuloma.

  - If intubating, use non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (NDMR)
- Administer lidocaine IV prior to extubation
## Hypercarbia

![](Pasted%20image%2020240312130838.png)

## Hypocapnia

![](Pasted%20image%2020240312151202.png)

## Tension Pneumothorax

### Background

- **Definition:** A tension pneumothorax occurs when air in the pleural space builds up enough pressure to reduce venous return, leading to hypotension, tachycardia, and severe dyspnea.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Patients receiving mechanical ventilation are more likely to progress to cardiovascular collapse.

### Signs

- UPS: Uninterrupted supply (blue socket) for instantaneous and continuous protection. This supply is limited therefore avoid using UPS sockets unless absolutely necessary.
- Devices’ internal battery backup: this may not supply all functions of the device and duration may be variable.
### Steps to Follow in Power Outage

#### Background

- **One Electrical Backup System (Generator/UPS):**
	
	- Current elective cases should be completed as soon as possible.
	- All other elective cases should be postponed.
	- Emergency cases can be continued.
- **Second Backup Power Supply (Generator/UPS) Available:**
	
	- Confirm that the second power source has adequate capacity for the duration of the power outage.
	- Elective cases can then continue.
- **Note:** Battery backup is not considered a reliable second backup power supply.
## Mains Oxygen Failure

**Complete failure of wall or pendant oxygen supply. Failure may be theatre-specific, zone-specific or hospital-wide.**

### START

1. **Inform the theatre team of the problem, including theatre coordinator (Box A).**
	
2. **Call for help, but be aware failure may be widespread.**
	
3. **Switch to cylinder oxygen supply.**
	
4. **Check remaining cylinder content (Box B):**
	
	- Ensure at least one further cylinder always available.
5. **Prolong duration of cylinder oxygen supply:**
	
	- Use circle system.
	- Use lowest possible fresh gas flow.
	- Use lowest possible FiO2.
	- Check FiO2 alarms.
6. **Minimise auxiliary gas usage:**
	
	- Some ventilator systems are gas-driven. If so, switching to manual ventilation will prolong oxygen cylinder supply.
7. **Evaluate moving to nearby area if oxygen supply there preserved.**
	
8. **Continue to monitor and ensure adequacy of inspired oxygen and volatile agent.**
	
9. **Workflow:**
	
	- Do not start any new case unless clinical priority absolutely requires it.
	- Expedite conclusion of current case if clinically appropriate.
	- Consider recovering the patient in theatre if recovery also affected (Box C).
10. **Disconnect from failed outlets and do not re-connect until safe to do so (Box D).**

#### Box A: ORGANISATIONAL ISSUES

- Theatre coordinator or equivalent should:
	- Ensure no new case is started unless clinical priority absolutely requires it.
	- Ascertain the extent of the failure throughout the hospital.
	- Ascertain the reserve supplies of oxygen.
	- Evaluate implications for ongoing supply.
	- Ensure any other relevant emergency plans are initiated.
	- Coordinate delivery of further oxygen cylinders in good time.
	- Ensure individual theatres are kept informed.

#### Box B: OXYGEN CYLINDER: REMAINING CONTENTS

| % full (pressure) | CYLINDER SIZE |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| 100% (137 bar)    | 170 L         |
| 50% (69 bar)      | 85 L          |
| 25% (34 bar)      | 43 L          |

#### Box C: RECOVERY

- Recovery area must be appropriately supplied with cylinder oxygen if also affected.
- Identify patients who do not require supplemental oxygen.

#### Box D: RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVICES

- Disconnect equipment from failed wall/pendant outlets.
- When re-established, output may not initially be 100% oxygen.
- Do not re-use outlet until gas composition and quality

## Compartment Syndrome

### Background

- Fascial membranes in the human body surround muscle groups.
- Compartment syndrome: increased pressure in fascial compartments compromises circulation and tissue function.
	- Positive feedback cycle: ischemia → necrosis → edema → increased compartment pressure.

### Epidemiology

- Commonly occurs after trauma, especially long bone fractures.
- Incidence: 7.3/100,000 in men and 0.7/100,000 in women.
- Most common sites:
	- Fibular and extensor compartments in the lower leg.
	- Extensor compartment in the forearm.

### Risk Factors

- Sustained fracture or soft-tissue injury:
	- Tibial diaphyseal, distal radius, and diaphyseal forearm fractures.
- Increased age.
- Comminuted fractures.
- High-energy mechanisms.

### Considerations

- High degree of suspicion in at-risk patients.
- **3 P’s** (low sensitivity, high specificity):
	- **Pain**: Main clinical sign, classically "out of proportion" to injury.
	- **Paresthesia**: Late clinical sign.
	- **Paresis**: Even later clinical sign.

### Diagnosis

1. Clinical signs/symptoms (3 P’s).
2. Measure compartment pressure; normal ~8 mmHg.
3. Calculate Critical Δ Tissue pressure = Diastolic BP - compartment pressure.
	- > 30 mmHg: Normal.
		
	- < 30 mmHg: Indication for fasciotomy (100% sensitivity and specificity).

### Management

- Adequate pain control with the lowest possible dose to avoid delayed diagnosis.
- Consider compartment syndrome with any sudden increase in pain.
- Avoid epidurals in at-risk patients:
	- Theoretical increased risk of delayed diagnosis.
	- If used, opt for low-concentration solutions.
- Peripheral regional anesthesia is safe and does not delay diagnosis:
	- Use dilute concentrations and minimal adequate dose.
- Liberal indication for fasciotomy.

# Iatrogenic
## Extravasation Injuries

### Management of Vasopressor Extravasation

1. **Immediate Actions**
	
	- Stop injection/infusion immediately; leave catheter in place.
	- Obtain substitute IV access; resume vasopressors.
	- Slowly aspirate as much of the drug as possible.
	- Elevate the area and apply warm compresses for 48 hours.
	- Consult plastic surgery and vascular surgery for ongoing management.
2. **Reversal**
	
	- **First-line**: Phentolamine subcutaneously.
		- Dilute 5 mg phentolamine in 10 mL 0.9% sodium chloride.
		- Dose: 0.1-0.2 mg/kg (up to 10 mg) injected through the catheter and subcutaneously around the site using a 25 g or smaller needle.
		- Additional injections if blanching returns.
		- Watch for systemic hypotension.
	- **Other options**:
		- Topical nitroglycerin 2%: 1-inch strip applied to the site of ischemia (redose q8h PRN).
		- Terbutaline subcutaneously: 1 mg in 10 mL NS, injected locally.
3. **Additional Interventions**
	
	- Consider sympathetic block (e.g., stellate ganglion).
	- **Saline Washout Method**:
		- Effective for removing drug and reducing tissue injury.
		- Under sterile conditions with local/general anesthesia, make 4-6 stab incisions around the extravasation area.
		- Insert a blunt-ended cannula through one incision and flush saline through subcutaneous tissues, exiting through other incisions.
	- **Liposuction**:
		- Use blunt-ended liposuction cannula to aspirate fat and extravasated material.
		- Less effective than saline washout.

### Prevention

- Avoid IVs in the hand/wrist.
- Avoid unreassuring IVs.
- Perform protocolized extremity checks.
- Keep antidotes and worksheet in the room with the patient.
- Phentolamine mesylate (10 mg) can be added to each liter of solution containing norepinephrine (vasopressor effect of norepinephrine is not affected).
## Dental Injury

### Considerations
- **Commonly Affected Teeth**: Upper central incisors are most frequently injured.
- **Patient Communication**: Inform patients of the risk of dental damage whenever manipulating the airway.
- **Causes**:
	- Intubation
	- LMA placement
	- Suctioning
	- Extubation
	- Post-extubation (e.g., biting down on OPA)
- **Risk Factors**:
	- Difficult intubation
	- Poor dentition
	- Previous dental work
- **Major Morbidity**: Tooth fragments aspirated into the airway pose significant risks.

### Management
1. **Handling Dislodged Teeth**:
   - Place dislodged teeth in saline.
2. **Fragment Retrieval**:
   - Ensure all tooth fragments are located and removed.
3. **Consultation**:
   - Consult dentistry for further evaluation and management.

### Prevention
- **Technique**: Employ careful technique during airway manipulation.
- **Device Choice**:
	- Opt for videolaryngoscopy (VL) over direct laryngoscopy (DL).
- **Protective Measures**:
	- Consider using a mouth guard during DL/VL.
	- Use muscle relaxants to minimize patient movement.
	- Implement a bite block to prevent post-extubation biting injuries.
