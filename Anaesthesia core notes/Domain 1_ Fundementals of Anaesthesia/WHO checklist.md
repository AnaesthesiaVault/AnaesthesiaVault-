# Checklist
## Surgical Safety Checklist

|Is the anaesthesia machine and medication check complete?|Yes|
|Is the pulse oximeter on the patient and functioning?|Yes|
|Does the patient have a:||
|Known allergy?|No / Yes|
|Difficult airway or aspiration risk?|No / Yes, and equipment/assistance available|
|Risk of >500ml blood loss (7ml/kg in children)?|No / Yes, and two IVs/central access and fluids planned|

### Before Skin Incision

_With nurse, anaesthetist, and surgeon_

|Question|Response Options|
|---|---|
|Confirm all team members have introduced themselves by name and role.||
|Confirm the patient’s name, procedure, and where the incision will be made.||
|Has antibiotic prophylaxis been given within the last 60 minutes?|Yes / No / Not applicable|
|Anticipated Critical Events||
|To Surgeon:||
|- What are the critical or non-routine steps?||
|- How long will the case take?||
|- What is the anticipated blood loss?||
|To Anaesthetist:||
|- Are there any patient-specific concerns?||
|To Nursing Team:||
|- Has sterility (including indicator results) been confirmed?||
|- Are there equipment issues or any concerns?||
|Is essential imaging displayed?|Yes / No / Not applicable|

### Before Patient Leaves Operating Room

_With nurse, anaesthetist, and surgeon_

| Nurse Verbally Confirms:                                                  |     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| - The name of the procedure                                               |     |
| - Completion of instrument, sponge, and needle counts                     |     |
| - Specimen labelling (read specimen labels aloud, including patient name) |     |
| - Whether there are any equipment problems to be addressed                |     |
| To Surgeon, Anaesthetist, and Nurse:                                      |     |
| - What are the key concerns for recovery and management of this patient?  |     |
|                                                                           |     |

## Surgical Safety Checklist Stages

### 1. Sign-In

_Before administration of anaesthesia_

- Confirm patient identity, surgical site, procedure, and consent
- Ensure the site is marked
- Complete anaesthesia machine and medication check
- Ensure pulse oximeter is on the patient and functioning
- Check for known allergies, difficult airway or aspiration risk, and risk of significant blood loss

### 2. Time-Out

_Immediately before the surgical incision_

- Confirm all team members have introduced themselves by name and role
- Verify the patient’s name, procedure, and incision site
- Ensure antibiotic prophylaxis has been given within the last 60 minutes
- Review anticipated critical events:
  - Surgeon: critical/non-routine steps, case duration, anticipated blood loss
  - Anaesthetist: patient-specific concerns
  - Nursing team: sterility confirmation, equipment issues
- Ensure essential imaging is displayed

### 3. Sign-Out

_At the end of operation before the patient is removed from the operating theatre_

- Nurse verbally confirms:
  - Procedure name
  - Completion of instrument, sponge, and needle counts
  - Specimen labeling
  - Any equipment problems to address
- Discuss key concerns for recovery and management of the patient

## Expanded 5-Step Process

1. **Briefing**
   - Team introductions
   - Introduction of each patient on the list
   - Discussion of any concerns

2. **Sign-In**
   - Before induction of anaesthesia
   - Confirmation of patient identity, procedure, and consent

3. **Time-Out**
   - Pause and final check before surgery starts

4. **Sign-Out**
   - Before all staff leave the theatre
   - Verification of swab count and equipment

5. **Debriefing**
   - At the end of the list
   - Discussion and reporting of issues

## Benefits of the Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC)

- Improves safety and reduces harm from potential errors
- Ensures confirmation of patient identity, surgical site, and important characteristics
- Significant reductions in:
  - Complications (from 11% to 7%)
  - In-hospital mortality (from 1.5% to 0.8%)
  - Rates of unplanned reoperation
  - Surgical site infections (SSI)

## Implementation

### Organizational Factors

### Tips for WHO Checklist Implementation

#### Leaders / Local Champions
- Engage administrative staff
- Support juniors
- Provide reasons to engage

#### Resources
- Conduct audits
- Provide feedback

#### Data Collection
- Track antibiotics administration before knife-to-skin
- Ensure checklist completion
- Collect audit samples
- Provide regular feedback

#### Documentation
- Record in patient notes or computer system

#### Training
- Form an implementation team
- Ensure multidisciplinary involvement
- Provide focused training for new practices

#### Communication
- Use names
- Ensure everyone is listening

#### Briefing and Debriefing

---

## Requirements for Successful Implementation

- Training and learning materials
- Organizational priority and leadership
- Checklist as a clinical governance goal
- Local champions and discussion groups/forums
- Clarify roles of each professional group
- Conduct regular audits and feedback sessions
- Support local measurement of effectiveness
- Encourage local adaptations
- Create evidence of success in improving patient safety

---

## Barriers to Checklist Implementation

### Pragmatic Challenges
- Duplication with existing checklists causing irritation and 'checklist fatigue'
- Time-consuming and inconvenient processes
- Inappropriate timing
- Poor communication
- Unfamiliarity and confusion about who should prompt items
- Absence of key team members
- Perception of checklist as a 'tick box exercise'

### Resources
- Lack of resources such as marker pens, antibiotics, and pulse oximeters

### Attitudes
- Denial that routine tasks can be forgotten
- Dismissive attitudes and lack of engagement
- Hierarchical structures discouraging open communication
- Embarrassment about introductions
- Lack of support from leaders or managers

### Underlying Processes of Care
- Lack of antibiotic policies and protocols
- No routine swab, needle, or instrument counts

## WHO 10 Essential Steps

1. Operate on the correct patient at the correct site
2. Use methods to prevent harm from anaesthetics and protect from pain
3. Recognize and prepare for life-threatening loss of airway or respiratory function
4. Prepare for risk of high blood loss
5. Avoid inducing allergic or adverse drug reactions
6. Minimize risk of surgical site infection
7. Prevent inadvertent retention of instruments and sponges
8. Secure and accurately identify all surgical specimens
9. Communicate and exchange critical information for safe operation conduct
10. Establish routine surveillance of surgical capacity, volume, and results
