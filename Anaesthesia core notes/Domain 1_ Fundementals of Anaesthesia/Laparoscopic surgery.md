# Laparoscopy

## Introduction
### Benefits
- Overall reduction in medical cost
- Less intraoperative bleeding
- Fewer postoperative pulmonary complications
- Reduced postoperative wound infection
- Decreased metabolic derangement
- Improved postoperative respiratory function

### Why CO₂?
#### The Ideal Gas for Insufflation
- Minimal peritoneal absorption
- Minimal physiological effects
- Rapid excretion of any absorbed gas
- Inability to support combustion
- Minimal effects from intravascular embolization
- High blood solubility

#### Comparison with Other Gases
- **Air and Oxygen**: Support combustion.
- **Helium and Nitrogen**: Insoluble, more serious cardiovascular effects, and expensive.
- **Argon**: Causes unwanted cardiovascular effects.
- **N₂O**: Does not suppress combustion.
- **CO₂**: Clears more rapidly, minimizing postoperative discomfort.

**Drawback**: Significant vascular absorption across the peritoneum, leading to hypercapnia and intravascular embolization.

## Pathophysiological Changes

### Cardiovascular System (CVS)
- **Intra-abdominal Pressure (IAP) below 15 mmHg**: Increases cardiac output (CO) due to venous return augmentation (blood is squeezed out of the splanchnic venous bed and returned to the heart) and sympathetic stimulation (hypercapnia) leading to increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and raised blood pressure (BP).
- **IAP greater than 15 mmHg**: Decreases CO due to decreased venous return from inferior vena cava (IVC) compression.
- **Bradyarrhythmias**: Vagal-induced.
- **Tachyarrhythmias**: Caused by high CO₂ and catecholamines.

*Management*: Induction of pneumoperitoneum in the horizontal position and maintain IAP around 12 mmHg.

### Respiratory System
- Reduced lung volumes, compliance, and functional residual capacity (FRC)
- Increased pulmonary artery pressure (PAP)
- Atelectasis and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch with more shunting
- Increased PaCO₂/PACo₂ gradient, resulting in hypoxia and hypercarbia
- Risk of endobronchial intubation and barotrauma

### Neurological Effects
- Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraocular pressure (IOP)
- Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) due to hypercapnia, Trendelenburg position, increased SVR, and IAP

### Renal System
- Reduced renal perfusion
- Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)
- Increased angiotensin II (AG2) causing vasoconstriction
- Further reduction in blood flow and risk of pre-renal injury

### Splanchnic Circulation
- Reduced flow to the kidneys and liver secondary to reduced CO and increased IAP
- Significant impact on patients with compromised renal and hepatic function

### Patient Positioning
- Risk of nerve injury

## Anaesthetic Considerations for Patients with Raised IAP
- **Liver Dysfunction**:
  - Lactate is no longer a reliable indicator of perfusion.
  - Alters drug handling.
- **Pharmacodynamics/Pharmacokinetics**:
  - Altered volume of distribution.
- **Haemodynamics**:
  - Hypovolemia and sensitivity to cardiodepressant effects of anaesthetic drugs.
  - Sudden decrease in afterload and reperfusion injury may result in hypotension, arrhythmia, or cardiac arrest.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Invasive monitoring may be required.
- **Ventilation**:
  - Monitor carefully during the release of IAP.

## Monitoring
- ECG, NIBP, SpO₂
- Airway pressure: Adjust controlled ventilation to maintain EtCO₂ at approximately 35 mmHg, requiring a 15%-25% increase in minute ventilation.
- Peripheral nerve stimulation
- Arterial line for patients with cardiopulmonary disorders to assess the gradient between PaCO₂ and PECO₂ due to V/Q mismatch. Perform ABG to assess the extent of the gradient.

## Risks
### Surgical Risks
- Visceral and vascular damage
- Venous gas embolism
- Smaller selection of instruments
- Difficult control of bleeding

### Positioning Risks
- Anti-Trendelenburg: Hypotension
- Extremes of position: Potential to slip on the table; secure with straps
- Steep Trendelenburg: Cerebral edema and upper airway edema

### Other Risks
- Tracheal tube migration
- Well-leg compartment syndrome:
  - Impaired arterial perfusion to raised lower limbs
  - Reduced femoral drainage secondary to pneumoperitoneum
  - Compression of venous vessels by lower limb supports
  - Signs: Disproportionate limb pain, myoglobin-associated renal failure, rhabdomyolysis
  - Risk reduction: Intermittent compression stockings, regular lower limb movement, pulse oximetry on toe
  - Risks: Obesity, prolonged surgery, muscular legs, peripheral vascular disease, hypotension, steep Trendelenburg

### Altered Physiology Secondary to Pneumoperitoneum

## Contraindications
### Absolute Contraindications
- Shock
- Markedly increased ICP
- Severe myopia and/or retinal detachment
- Inadequate surgical equipment
- Inadequate monitoring devices

### Relative Contraindications
- Bullous emphysema
- History of spontaneous pneumothorax
- Pregnancy
- Life-threatening emergencies
- Prolonged laparoscopy (more than 6 hours) associated with acidosis and hypothermia
- New laparoscopic procedures

## Complications
- Inadvertent extraperitoneal insufflation
- Direct intravascular gas insufflation: Tear in an abdominal wall or peritoneum vessel leading to gas embolism (rare but potentially lethal)
  - Symptoms: Profound hypotension, cyanosis, dysrhythmias, asystole
  - Initial increase in EtCO₂ concentration, followed by a decrease due to cardiovascular collapse and reduced pulmonary blood flow
  - Mill-wheel murmur may be auscultated
- Pneumothorax
- Pneumomediastinum/Pneumopericardium
- Vascular/GIT and GUT injuries

## Pregnancy
### Guidelines by the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons
- Monitor fetal and uterine status, as well as end-tidal PCO₂ and maternal arterial blood gases.
- Use an open technique to enter the abdomen.
- Avoid aortocaval compression.
- Use low pneumoperitoneum pressures (between 10 and 15 mmHg).
## Recommendations for Safe Laparoscopy in Pregnant Patients

1. **Timing of Procedure**
   - Laparoscopy should be performed **before 32 weeks gestation** to avoid the risk of preterm labor and to allow adequate surgical access. The **second trimester** is the preferred period if possible.

2. **Abdominal Access**
   - Abdominal access should be **open** and trochars should be placed **away from the uterus** to minimize the risk of uterine injury.

3. **Mechanical Ventilation**
   - Mechanical ventilation should be adjusted to maintain **physiologic maternal alkalosis**, ensuring appropriate maternal and fetal gas exchange.

4. **Tocolytics**
   - **Prophylactic tocolytics** are unnecessary but should be available to manage preterm labor if it occurs.

5. **Fetal Monitoring**
   - The fetus can be adequately monitored using **transvaginal ultrasound**.

6. **Body Positioning**
   - The body positioning should avoid **inferior vena cava compression**, which can impair venous return and reduce cardiac output.

7. **Insufflation Pressure**
   - Abdominal insufflation pressure should be kept as **low as possible** to minimize the risk of compromising maternal and fetal hemodynamics.
