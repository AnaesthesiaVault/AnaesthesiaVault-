# Positioning in Anaesthesia

## General Considerations

1. **Cardiovascular Changes:**
   - Preload → Cardiac output

2. **Respiratory Changes:**
   - Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)
   - Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) ratio

3. **Cerebral Effects:**
   - Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF)
   - Intracranial Pressure (ICP)

4. **Pressure Points:**
   - Areas of potential pressure-induced injury

5. **Nerve Injuries:**
   - Caused by pressure or stretch

6. **Ocular Injury:**
   - Risk of perioperative visual loss (POVL)

7. **Musculoskeletal:**
   - Effects on lumbar and sacroiliac (SI) joints

8. **Gastro-Oesophageal Junction (GOJ) Barrier Pressure:**
   - Increased reflux risk

9. **Equipment Issues:**
   - Airway, lines, monitors, invasive blood pressure (IBP) monitoring

10. **Reversal to Normal Position:**
	- Physiological effects of repositioning

**Note:** Specific complications can occur with particular positions.

## Equipment

Accessory equipment used to ensure optimal and safe patient positioning may include:

- Head-ring or head support system
- Arm supports and boards
- Gel pads and sandbags
- Leg supports or stirrups
- Fixed supports that attach to the operating table (e.g., hip post)
- Foam mattress and foam facial support devices (e.g., ProneView™)
- Table straps
- Vacuum positioning systems
- Ample soft material for padding

## Risks

### Common Contributing Factors to Mechanical Injury

**Patient Risk Factors:**
- Gender (M > F)
- Age
- Obesity
- Frailty
- Diabetes
- Neuropathy
- Smoking
- Steroids
- Vascular disease

**Physical Factors:**
- Compression
- Stretch
- Sharp trauma
- Shear
- Temperature (burns)

**Physiological Factors:**
- Hypoxia
- Hypotension
- Dehydration
- Hypothermia
- Electrolyte disturbance
- Perioperative nerve injury is the second most common class of injury associated with anaesthesia, accounting for 22% of malpractice claims.
- The exact incidence of perioperative nerve injury is difficult to define but occurs in an estimated 0.028% to 1.5% of patients undergoing surgery.
- The ulnar nerve, brachial plexus, and lumbosacral nerve roots are associated with the majority of malpractice claims.

## Aetiology

- The aetiology of perioperative nerve injury is not well understood and is likely multifactorial, including nerve compression, stretch, metabolic derangement, and ischaemia.
- An identifiable mechanism of injury is found in less than 10% of cases.
- Symptoms of peripheral nerve injury may be evident immediately but are more commonly present between 1 and 7 days after surgery.
- If nerve damage is suspected after surgery, early neurological referral is recommended. Investigations including electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in detecting and evaluating injuries.
- Over half of peripheral neuropathies resolve within a year, with many improving within 6 weeks.

## Grading of Nerve Injury

- **Grade I (Neurapraxia):** Focal segmental demyelination (myelin sheath only)
- **Grade II (Axonotmesis):** Damaged axon with intact endoneurium
- **Grade III (Axonotmesis):** Damaged axon and endoneurium with intact perineurium
- **Grade IV (Axonotmesis):** Damaged axon, endoneurium, and perineurium with intact epineurium
- **Grade V (Neurotmesis):** Complete nerve transection

## Considerations

- Very rare event (incidence ~0.03%)
- Ultrasound (U/S) use in regional anaesthesia does not reduce the risk of nerve injury
- Important to document pre-existing neurological deficits

**Mechanisms:**
- Direct nerve damage from trauma
- Stretch and compression
- Ischemia
- Toxicity from injected solutions
- Second-hit on a nerve with pre-existing injury

**Risk Factors:**
- Neurological, cardiac, gastrointestinal, and orthopedic surgery
- Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking
- Pre-existing peripheral neuropathies
- General anaesthesia, epidural
- Decreased fluid status, hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, hypothermia

**Signs/Symptoms:**
- Depend on the specific nerve injured
- Anaesthesia, paraesthesia, hypo/hyperaesthesia, pain, motor deficit

## Prevention

- Despite poor understanding of the aetiology of nerve injury, it is recommended the anaesthetist pays careful attention to patient positioning, ensures vulnerable areas are well protected, that nerves are not stretched or compressed, and that intraoperative hypotension, hypothermia, and dehydration are avoided.
- This approach is crucial for all patients, especially those with predisposing risk factors and those undergoing prolonged procedures.
- Understand which nerves are at risk with each procedure/position.
- Avoid hypotension, hypothermia, dehydration.
- Careful positioning and judicious padding.
- Avoid contact of susceptible nerves with hard surfaces.

**Regional Techniques:**
- Use less toxic local anaesthetics and vasoconstrictors (e.g., ropivacaine).
- Avoid injecting during pain or paraesthesia (likely perineurial injection).

**Lower Limb Nerves:**
- Adequate padding when patient is in lithotomy, prone, or lateral positions (hip flexion > 120 degrees).

## Management

- Clinical exam/history to localize the lesion and identify pre-existing lesions.
- Document sensory/motor deficits and severity for prognosis.
- Consult neurology.
- Request EMG and nerve conduction studies to determine:
  - Complete vs incomplete lesion
  - Localization of lesion
  - Severity and age of lesion
  - Guide prognosis and recovery course
- MRI +/- high-resolution ultrasound may help further localize ambiguous lesions.

### Algorithm for Management of Nerve Injury Associated with Regional Anaesthesia

1. **Suspected Nerve Injury Defined As:**
   - New onset of pain, weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, or other abnormal sensation.
   - Effects lasting beyond the usual duration of the specific block (e.g., if a single-shot peripheral nerve block (PNB) lasts >48 hours).

2. **Initial Review:**
   - Review relevant medical and surgical history.
   - Review operation and anaesthetic records, drug chart, and observations chart.
   - Clinical examination including neurological examination by the responsible surgical team.

3. **Special Note:**
   - In case of suspected space-occupying lesion (SOL) associated with central neuraxial blocks, treat as emergency and follow local Guidelines for management of Epidural Analgesia.

4. **Symptom Management:**
   - **Mild or Resolving Symptoms or Persistent Sensory Deficit:**
	 - Reassure the patient and review in 4 weeks.
   - **Persistent Symptoms:**
	 - **Neurological Referral Consider:**
	   - MRI and other imaging.
	   - Nerve conduction tests (NCT).
	   - Electromyography (EMG).
   - **Complete or Progressive Neurological Deficit or Presence of Motor Deficit:**
	 - Inform the responsible surgical and anaesthetic team and, if applicable, Acute Pain Service.
	 - Consider surgical cause (e.g., hematoma, cut, stretch injury, etc.) and appropriate intervention (decompression, reconstruction, etc.).
	 - Consider further imaging (particularly, if space-occupying lesion is suspected) and emergency decompression if needed.
	 - Immediate neurological referral.
	 - Nerve conduction tests (NCT).
	 - Electromyography (EMG).
	 - **Definitive Diagnosis:**
	   - Conservative treatment (drugs, physiotherapy, etc.) or surgical intervention as above.
	   - Keep the patient and responsible team informed.
	   - Follow up as appropriate.

## Specific Nerve Injury

### Upper Limb

**Ulnar Nerve Injury (C7, C8-T1):**
- **Common:** Most common due to superficial location near the medial condyle.
- **Mechanism:** Direct pressure on the ulnar groove; prolonged forearm flexion.
- **Signs/Symptoms:** Tingling/numbness along the pinky finger; weakness in finger abduction/adduction; hyperextension of MCP joints; flexion at distal/proximal IP joints of ring/little finger.
- **Prevention:** Mandatory padding; keep forearm in supine/neutral position; maintain flexion/extension of elbow < 90 degrees.

**Brachial Plexus Injury (C5-T1):**
- **Common:** Superficial structure running between intervertebral foramen and axillary sheath.
- **Mechanism:** Compression (e.g., retraction during median sternotomy); stretching (e.g., arm abduction and external rotation); direct trauma during regional technique.

- **Prevention:** General considerations as described above.

### Lower Limb

**Sciatic Nerve Injury (L4-S3):**
- **Common:** Men > women; T2DM.
- **Mechanisms:** Lithotomy, frog leg, and seated positions (hyperflexion of the hip, abduction, and extension of the leg); direct damage during regional techniques and hip replacement surgery.
- **Signs/Symptoms:** Hamstring muscle paralysis; weak knee flexion; foot drop; numbness below the knee except the medial aspect of the leg and foot.
- **Prevention:** Adequate padding when patient is in lithotomy, prone, or lateral positions (hip flexion > 120 degrees).

**Femoral Nerve Injury (L2-4):**
- **Mechanisms:** Pelvic brim injury due to retractors in abdominal/pelvic surgery; ischemia during aortic cross clamp; lithotomy position (extreme abduction of the thigh and external rotation of the hip); direct damage during vascular surgery involving femoral vessels and hip replacement.
- **Signs/Symptoms:** Numbness in the anterior thigh and medial leg; weakness in hip flexion and knee extension; absent knee jerk reflex.
- **Prevention:** Adequate padding when patient is in lithotomy, prone, or lateral positions (hip flexion > 120 degrees).

**Superficial Peroneal Nerve Injury (L4-S2):**
- **Common:** Compression against the fibular head.
- **Mechanism:** Direct trauma during knee arthroplasty; lithotomy/lateral position.
- **Signs/Symptoms:** Weakness in dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot; numbness in the anterolateral leg and dorsum of the digits.
- **Prevention:** Adequate padding when patient is in lithotomy, prone, or lateral positions (hip flexion > 120 degrees).

### Skin and Tissue Damage

- Pressure-induced injury may occur over bony prominences, especially when pressure has been applied for a long period of time.
- Reduction in tissue perfusion can lead to ischaemia and necrosis. The elderly, frail, and those with poor nutritional status are especially at risk.
- Careful positioning, padding, and regular assessment are important to prevent the development of pressure areas.

### Eye Injury

- Eye injury may occur in any surgical position. The incidence of corneal abrasion under anaesthesia has been estimated at 0.034% to 0.17%.
- Causes include injury to the cornea from drapes, facemasks, hard materials, or chemicals such as surgical skin cleansing agents.
- Corneal abrasions can occur in the unclosed and non-blinking eye due to reduced tear flow, resulting in dry eyes, and loss of the protective blink reflex.
- Commonly, tape is applied to the eyelids to close the eye and protect the patient from corneal abrasions. Taping the eye closed is more protective than applying ointment.
# Repositioning
## Repositioning Checklist

**A. Airway**

- Endotracheal tube/LMA: Patent and in correct position

**B. Breathing**

- Ventilation: Pulmonary compliance satisfactory
- Auscultation: Both axillae
- Monitoring: SaO₂, Capnograph trace and shape

**C. Circulation**

- Monitoring: HR/BP/ECG still functioning and readings stable
- Intravascular lines: All still in situ, patent, and accessible

# Complications by Position

## Supine Position

- **Cardiovascular:**
  - 🔻 Decreased Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) -> hypoxaemia; worse in pregnancy and obesity
  - Aortocaval compression in pregnant patients -> hypotension
- **Pressure Points:**
  - Pressure on heels and calves -> use preformed gel heel supports and a soft pillow behind the knees
  - Pressure on occiput -> use head pillow or soft padding
- **Musculoskeletal:**
  - Knee pillow lessens flattening of the lumbar lordosis on a firm operating table and prevents overextension at the knee
- **Nerve Injuries:**
  - Ulnar nerve: Avoid direct pressure at the superficial condylar groove at the elbow and overextension
  - Radial nerve: Avoid compression lateral humerus
  - Brachial plexus: Keep arm abducted less than 90 degrees, hand pronated, and head in a neutral position (or turned towards the abducted arm)

## Lateral Position

- **Airway and Head:**
  - Limited access to manipulate head and neck -> secure airway with ETT
  - Keep head neutral to prevent brachial plexus stretching
- **Support and Padding:**
  - Use axillary roll to protect brachial plexus
  - Position arms forward and flexed
  - Place all IV cannulas, BP cuffs, and pulse oximeters on the upper arm if possible
  - Check and pad pressure points
  - Place pillow between knees to prevent common peroneal and saphenous nerve injury
  - Stabilize in lateral position with supports/straps
  - Be cautious if table is flexed or "broken"
- **Respiratory and Circulatory:**
  - Reduced venous return and hypoventilation to dependent lung -> V/Q mismatch

## Lithotomy Position

- **Nerve Injuries:**
  - Common peroneal nerve injury most common: Avoid excessive knee flexion and prolonged lithotomy
  - Sciatic, femoral, saphenous, and obturator nerve injuries from excessive hip flexion
- **Musculoskeletal:**
  - Compartment syndrome of calf: Prolonged procedure, excessive dorsiflexion, tight leg straps
- **Circulatory and Respiratory:**
  - Increased venous return and cardiac output (reversed when legs are lowered)
  - Reduced FRC -> hypoxaemia and hypoventilation
  - Increased intra-abdominal pressure -> risk of regurgitation; use ETT in at-risk patients
- **Prevention:**
  - Move patient's legs simultaneously up into or down from the lithotomy position
  - Use padded leg supports to allow circulation
  - Monitor and protect hands and fingers
## Trendelenburg and Reverse Trendelenburg

### Definition
- Tilted 15 degrees or greater head down.

### Complications
- **Respiratory:**
  - Reduction in FRC -> cephalad movement of diaphragm, small airway collapse, respiratory compromise
  - Atelectasis -> decreased respiratory compliance, risk of barotrauma
- **Head and Neck:**
  - Facial and laryngeal oedema (assess prior to extubation with a cuff leak test)
  - Endotracheal tube tip may move caudad -> risk of endobronchial intubation
  - Increased ICP, IOP, IAP -> risk of regurgitation
- **Circulatory:**
  - Increased venous return
- **Safety:**
  - Secure patient to prevent sliding and falling from arm boards
  - Worse complications with greater degree of tilt, especially in obese patients
- **Reverse Trendelenburg:** Opposite effects

## Sitting or Beach Chair Position

- **Circulatory:**
  - Decreased venous return and hypotension -> reduced cerebral perfusion
  - Place transducer at level of tragus for accurate readings
  - Hip flexion to 100 degrees, leg elevation, bending knees, compression stockings -> reduce venous pooling
- **Air Embolism:**
  - Venous air embolism risk -> hypoxia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest (25-75% in neurosurgery cases)
- **Cerebral and Ocular:**
  - Decreased ICP and IOP
- **Positioning:**
  - Avoid excess head flexion -> risk of tongue swelling
  - Support arms in padded gutters to avoid brachial plexus and shoulder traction injuries
  - Ensure airway access -> use ETT and check with flexion for movement of ETT

### Contraindications for Sitting Position
- **Absolute:**
  - Ventriculo-atrial shunt
  - Right-to-left heart shunt
- **Relative:**
  - Patent foramen ovale
  - Uncontrolled hypertension
  - Extremes of age
  - Severe autonomic neuropathy

### Loss of Blood Pressure Differential and Management
- **VAE:** Cover field with saline-soaked swabs, lower field below heart, administer oxygen, stop N₂O, support CVS with fluid/inotropes, perform chest compressions if arrest occurs, use CVP to aspirate air from right atrium, apply Durant manoeuvre (partial left lateral position)
- **PNS-Mediated:** Stop manipulating, administer anticholinergic
- **LAST:** Administer intralipid

## Prone Position

- **Table Setup:**
  - Use a mattress to allow body support
- **Head, Neck, and Airway:**
  - Keep head and neck neutral
  - Avoid head and neck rotation, flexion, extension to prevent vascular occlusion
  - Use gel mask for face: eyes, nose, and mouth free
  - Use armoured COETT for limited access
  - Monitor for facial and neck swelling and oedema
  - Raised ICP
- **Abdomen:**
  - Keep abdomen free for ventilation, avoid abdominal compression -> reduces venous return and increases bleeding risk
  - Give 5-10 ml/kg fluid bolus to counteract drop in CO due to decreased venous return through IVC after proning
- **Extremities:**
  - Pad limbs, pre-patellar, pre-tibial, dorsum of foot, ASIS
  - Use pillow under feet to avoid hyperextension of knees
  - High risk of ocular compression
  - Ensure soft tissue protection (male genitals and breasts)
- **Safety:**
  - Secure and monitor IV lines and other equipment to avoid tangling

### Considerations of the Prone Position
**Head, Eyes, and Neck:**
- Maintain head and neck in a neutral position
- Pad pressure points, particularly over the ears, forehead, and chin
- Ensure eyes are free of external pressure and closed to prevent corneal abrasions
- The endotracheal tube should be secured before turning prone to avoid kinking and airway oedema with prolonged surgery

**Chest:**
- Protect pressure points on the chest wall
- Reduced compliance of the chest wall may impair ventilation

**Abdomen:**
- Avoid abdominal compression as it results in organ dysfunction, epidural venous engorgement, and increased bleeding

**Limbs:**
- Ensure careful positioning to avoid nerve injury
