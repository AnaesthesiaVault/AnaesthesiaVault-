# 4 D's of Fluid Management

# Solutions

## Fluids/Type

### Balanced

**Intravenous “balanced” solutions** include crystalloids and colloids with minimal effect on the homeostasis of the extracellular compartment, and in particular on acid–base equilibrium and electrolyte concentrations.

#### Physiology

**Two main categories**:

1. Fluids causing a minimal effect on acid–base equilibrium, having an electrolyte content with an in vivo strong ion difference (SID), i.e., the SID after metabolism of the organic anion, close to 24–29 mEq/L.
2. Fluids having a normal or sub-normal Cl<sup>−</sup> content (Cl<sup>−</sup> ≤ 110 mEq/L).

**Three variables regulating pH of biological fluids**:

1. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO<sub>2</sub>).
2. The concentration of non-volatile weak acids (ATOT).
3. The strong ion difference (SID), defined as the difference between the sum of all strong cations and the sum of all strong anions.

These principles clearly suggest that intravenous fluids may affect pH due to:

1. The specific electrolyte content characterizing the solution, therefore altering the SID of the extracellular compartment.
2. The dilution effect due to the volume infused, thus reducing the concentration of ATOT.

The ideal balanced solution should have an in vivo SID equal to the baseline concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>:

- If the SID of the infused fluid is greater than plasma HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, plasma pH will tend toward alkalosis.
- If the SID of the infused fluid is lower than plasma HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, plasma pH will tend toward acidosis, as it is always the case for NaCl 0.9%.

**Balanced solution** also includes a category of isoand near-isotonic fluids with a low Cl<sup>−</sup> content (equal to or lower than 110 mEq/L):

- Final composition of such a fluid will depend on:
  1. Tonicity.
  2. Electrical neutrality.
  3. SID.

An isotonic balanced solution leaving unaltered acid–base equilibrium (i.e., with an SID close to 24 mEq/L) will necessarily have a Cl<sup>−</sup> content > 110 mEq/L (as in Sterofundin-ISO).

- In contrast, a fluid with an SID of 24 mEq/L and a lower Cl<sup>−</sup> content will necessarily be slightly hypotonic (as with Lactated Ringer’s).
- An isotonic fluid with a low Cl<sup>−</sup> content will necessarily have a higher SID (as with PlasmaLyte), with a consequent alkalizing effect.

#### Case for Chloride-rich NaCl 0.9%

**Acidosis and Hyperchloraemia**:

- Contraction of vascular smooth muscles leading to reduced renal perfusion.

**Increased ADH and hypertonicity**:

- Slower renal excretion, resulting in more fluid being retained in the interstitial space.
- Abdominal discomfort in healthy people.

**Clinical Evidence**:

- PlasmaLyte® versus NaCl 0.9% on the first day of major abdominal surgery led to significantly less renal failure requiring dialysis.

**SMART and SPLIT trials**:

- No significant difference in the main outcome, i.e., incidence of acute kidney injury.
- No reduction of in-hospital mortality.
- Neither the incidence of renal replacement therapy nor the incidence of persistent renal dysfunction was statistically significant.
- Problem with trials is that very minimal fluid has been given.

#### Summary

- Avoid fluid-induced metabolic acidosis and excessive chloride loading by simply using balanced solutions. There is increasing evidence that excessive chloride administration may have a detrimental effect on renal function, even at low doses.
- Use of balanced solutions, particularly in patients who potentially need a significant amount of intravenous fluids, seems to be a reasonable pragmatic choice.
- Saline may be an intuitive choice for patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia or hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.
- The patient’s serum chloremia is an important factor in determining the appropriate type of fluids.

## Albumin

### Albumin

**Normal plasma protein content**: 35-55 g/L, comprising 50% of plasma protein.

**Oncotic property**:

- Plays a role in the regulation of microcirculatory fluid dynamics, also applies to the endothelial glycocalyx layer.
  - The gel-like layer lining the luminal side of the endothelium is thought to comprise 20% of the intravascular volume.
  - Holds many compounds necessary for endothelial function, mediates several key physiological processes, such as maintaining the vascular barrier, hemostasis, prevention of cell adhesion to the endothelium, and transmission of shear stress.
  - Shedding of the glycocalyx occurs in the presence of reactive oxygen species, hyperglycemia, cytokines, and endotoxin.
  - Loss of barrier function induced by glycocalyx shedding is associated with the formation of edema.
  - The amount of glycocalyx shedding was proportional to the volume of fluid given in septic shock patients.

### Case for Albumin

**ALBIOS study**:

- Investigated whether albumin administration improves outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock.
- Some beneficial physiologic effects observed (lower heart rates, higher mean arterial pressure, and lower daily net positive fluid balance over the first 7 days).
- No difference observed in mortality at 90 days (41.1% vs. 43.6%) or in overall organ failure scores.

### Case against Albumin

- Colloids should remain in the intravascular space longer than crystalloids, provided the endothelial barrier is intact, which is often not the case.
- No randomized controlled trial has shown any significant benefit of fluid resuscitation using albumin over other types of fluids, including crystalloids.
- To date, the theoretical benefits of albumin are not supported by sound clinical evidence, and the case for albumin remains controversial.

The primary aim of perioperative fluid management is to avoid both fluid overload and under-hydration, while maintaining patients’ fluid balance as close as possible to zero. Patients develop postoperative complications when fluid retention exceeds 2.5 L. Results regarding a preload strategy have been discouraging.

## Fluid Management Intraoperative

- **Restrictive Regimen:**
  - Associated with better outcomes following colorectal surgery.
  - The regimen was restrictive compared with a standard of care that was excessive (e.g., 5 L positive balance due to high crystalloid volumes).
  - It is conceivable that the group with a better outcome benefited more from the avoidance of fluid excess than from fluid restriction.
- **Fluid Administration Post-Induction:**
  - Fluid given after the induction of anaesthesia mainly increases “unstressed” blood volume, due to vasodilatation as a consequence of anaesthesia.
  - Additional fluid administration is needed to optimize stroke volume, i.e., to add to the “stressed” intravascular volume.
  - Many clinicians still consider this “wet” approach as the gold standard for intraoperative fluid therapy, although intravascular volume expansion has potential dangers.
	- In response to a rapid infusion of crystalloids, ANP levels increase 2to 3-fold.
	- Myocardial work and cardiac pressures increase when infused fluids exceed the degree of anesthesia-induced vasodilatation.
	- Fluid overload reduces colloid osmotic pressure, which, together with raised cardiac pressures, might promote pulmonary edema. These issues are particularly relevant in patients with poor cardiovascular status.
- **Recommended Protocols:**
  - Infusion of balanced crystalloids at 1–3 ml/kg/h.
  - Additional boluses of fluid to match needs judged by either measured volumes lost during surgery or the assessment of peripheral perfusion (such as according to the so-called ‘Goal-Directed Fluid Restriction).

### Liberal vs. Restrictive Fluid Regimen

**RELIEF Trial (2018):**
- In patients at increased risk for complications while undergoing elective major abdominal surgery, a restrictive fluid regimen was not associated with a higher rate of disability-free survival than a liberal fluid regimen one year after surgery.
- However, the restrictive regimen was associated with a higher rate of acute kidney injury.

**Conclusion:**
- A modestly liberal fluid regimen is perhaps preferred, reinforcing the Goldilocks principle–not too much, not too little, but an amount that’s just right.

#### Resuscitation Phase (R) or Salvage Phase (S)
- **Objective**: Manage hemodynamic shock and restore perfusion.
- **Actions**:
  - Administer a rapid fluid bolus (typically 3–4 mL/kg over 10 to 15 minutes), repeating as necessary, in conjunction with vasopressors.
  - Perform emergency procedures.
  - Initiate hemodynamic monitoring.
  - Ensure a positive fluid balance.

#### Optimization Phase (O)
- **Objective**: Stabilize hemodynamics and maintain adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation.
- **Characteristics**: The patient is no longer in overt hypovolemia but remains hemodynamically unstable.
- **Actions**:
  - Administer fluids based on individual needs, reassessed regularly using the fluid challenge technique.
  - **Fluid Challenge Technique (TROL)**:
	- **Type of Fluid**: Use balanced crystalloids (e.g., PlasmaLyte).
	- **Rate**: Administer 100–200 mL over 10 minutes.
	- **Objective**: Achieve goals such as normal arterial pressure or heart rate.
	- **Limits**: Avoid high central venous pressure levels.
  - Monitoring involves multiple modalities (e.g., arterial catheter, echocardiography, central venous pressure, arteriovenous blood gas) to detect markers of hypoperfusion (e.g., lactate levels, prolonged capillary refill time, mottling score).

#### Stabilization Phase (S)
- **Objective**: Maintain fluid balance to support ongoing losses and provide organ support.
- **Actions**: Target a zero or slightly negative fluid balance.

#### Evacuation Phase (E) or De-escalation Phase (D)
- **Objective**: Remove excess fluid.
- **Actions**: Encourage spontaneous diuresis as the patient recovers. Use ultrafiltration or diuretics if necessary.

### Recommendations Regarding Fluid Resuscitation in Severe Burns' Patients

| Type of fluid               | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Normal saline**           | Given the fact that fluid resuscitation in burn management requires large volumes, the use of saline cannot be recommended in a burn resuscitation protocol                                                                                                       |
| **Balanced crystalloid**    | Based on the available evidence, balanced crystalloid solutions are a pragmatic initial resuscitation fluid in the majority of acutely ill (and burn) patients                                                                                                    |
| **Semi-synthetic colloids** | Given the recent data concerning the use of semi-synthetic colloids (and starches in particular), their use in critically ill patients, including burn patients, cannot be recommended                                                                            |
| **Albumin**                 | Based on the available evidence the use of albumin 20% can be recommended in severe burns, especially in the deresuscitation phase guided by indices of capillary leak, body weight, (cumulative) fluid balance, fluid overload, extravascular lung water and IAP |
| **Hypertonic solutions**    | To this day, there is insufficient evidence to reach consensus regarding the safety of hypertonic saline in burn resuscitation. Whenever using hypertonic saline in clinical practice, however, close monitoring of sodium levels is highly advised               |

# Fluid Responsiveness

## Fluid Responsiveness

### Definition
- **Fluid Responsiveness**: An increase in cardiac output (CO) by 10-15% following administration of a fluid bolus.
- Approximately 50% of hemodynamically unstable patients in the ICU and theatre respond to a fluid challenge, indicating that 50% of patients receiving a fluid bolus may not benefit from the therapy.
- A weight gain of >10% above preoperative baseline is associated with increased morbidity, ICU length of stay, and mortality.
- Tissue edema has deleterious effects, including:
  - **Respiratory**: Post-operative respiratory failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema.
  - **Gastrointestinal (GIT)**: Decreased motility and ileus due to GIT edema, contributing to anastomotic breakdown, acute ascites, and abdominal compartment syndrome.
  - **Coagulation**: Dilutional coagulopathy.
  - **Wound Healing**: Impaired wound healing due to marked tissue edema.

### Physiology
- **Cardiac Output (CO) Equation**: \(\text{CO} = \text{SV} \times \text{HR} \)
  - **Stroke Volume (SV)**: Determined by myocardial contractility, afterload, and preload.

#### Preload
- **Definition**: Intraluminal pressure that stretches the right or left ventricle to its end diastolic dimensions, related to the diastolic length of the cardiac myocyte.
- **Starling's Law**: The force of cardiac myocyte contraction depends on the preceding diastolic length of ventricular fibers. This ensures the cardiac output of the right and left ventricles are matched.
- **Determinants**:
  - **Venous Return (VR)**: The main determinant of right and left ventricular preload (right ventricular end-diastolic volume, RVEDV).
	- **Equation**: \(\text{VR} = \frac{\text{MSFP} - \text{RAP}}{\text{SVR}} \)
	  - **MSFP**: Mean systemic filling pressure
	  - **RAP**: Right atrial pressure
	  - **SVR**: Systemic vascular resistance
	- **Factors Affecting VR**:
	  - Blood volume
	  - Posture
	  - Venous tone
	  - Intrapericardial pressure
	  - Thoracic pressure
	  - Muscle pump
  - **Heart Rate (HR)**: Higher HR reduces diastolic filling time.
  - **Atrial Contraction**: Essential for ventricular filling.
  - **Ventricular Compliance**: Affected by hypertrophy, tamponade, and fibrosis.
- Increasing blood volume and venous return is only one factor affecting CO. Preload can also be described as the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV).

#### Frank-Starling Mechanism
- As preload increases, left ventricular SV increases until optimal preload is achieved. Beyond this point, SV remains relatively constant.
- **Optimal Preload**: Point where there is maximal overlap of actin-myosin myofibrils.
- Operating near the 'flat' part of the Frank-Starling curve means fluid loading will minimally affect CO, increasing tissue edema and hypoxia.
- **Poor Contractility**: Reduces the slope of the ascending portion of the curve, limiting SV increase with preload.
- **Healthy Individuals**: Both ventricles operate on the ascending portion of the curve, providing functional reserve during acute stress.
- **Note**: Determining preload (LVEDV) does not indicate whether the patient is on the ascending part of the Frank-Starling curve and thus does not predict fluid responsiveness.

#### Mark-Phillips Curve
- **Depiction**: Illustrates the accumulation of extravascular lung water (EVLW), a measure of interstitial fluid volume, aiding in the assessment of volume overload.
- **Transpulmonary Thermodilution Techniques**: Used to calculate EVLW.
- **Fluid Responsiveness and EVLW**: As patients become less fluid responsive, EVLW increases markedly due to elevated cardiac filling pressures and hydrostatic pressures.
- **Endothelial Damage**: More pronounced in patients with conditions like sepsis and burns, where increased EVLW is a strong predictor of mortality.

## Static Variables in Fluid Responsiveness
- **Static variables** are weak indicators of fluid responsiveness, not sensitive, with poor inter-observer reliability and often reflect peripheral perfusion.

### Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate (HR)
- **BP and HR** are not indicative of the position on the Frank-Starling curve (FSC).

### Urine Output
- **Oliguria**: Urine output (UO) <0.5 mL/kg/hr is traditionally used as an indicator of hypovolemia.

### Lactate
- **Lactate**: Rising lactate levels can indicate reduced global tissue perfusion.

### Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation
- **SvO2**: Proportional to cardiac output, tissue perfusion, and oxygen delivery to tissues; inversely proportional to tissue oxygen consumption. SvO2 may not reflect changes in tissue perfusion during the perioperative period when oxygen consumption varies.

### Central Venous Pressure (CVP)
- **CVP**: An indirect measure of LVEDV.
  - Pressure-volume relationship is inaccurate due to changes in intrathoracic pressures (e.g., PEEP), venous tone, ventricular compliance, and geometry.
  - No association between CVP and circulating blood volume; hence, CVP is a poor indicator of right and left ventricular preload and does not predict fluid responsiveness.
  - **CVP Ranges**:
	- <6 mmHg: Increased likelihood of fluid responsiveness.
	- >15 mmHg: Increased risk of peripheral edema.
	- 6-15 mmHg: No correlation.
  - Trend might be useful.

### Pulmonary Artery Occlusion Pressure (PAOP)
- **PAOP**: Poor predictor of preload and volume responsiveness. Measures LVEDP as a surrogate for LVEDV, suffering similar limitations to CVP.

### Inferior Vena Cava Diameter (IVC)
- **IVC Diameter**: Diameter <1.5 cm (15 mm) can identify fluid responsiveness in hypovolemic patients.

### Left Ventricle Size
- **Hyperdynamic LV**: End-diastolic area <10 cm² or papillary apposition (kissing sign) indicates hypovolemia.
  - Can be misleading in LV hypertrophy, highly inotropic state, and vasodilatory state.

## Dynamic Variables in Fluid Responsiveness
- Superior to static variables in assessing response to a fluid challenge.
- **Criteria for Accurate Prediction**:
  1. Controlled mechanical ventilation with tidal volume >8 mL/kg predicted body weight.
  2. Regular heart rhythm.
  3. No spontaneous breathing.
  4. Closed chest.
  5. No mechanical assist devices (e.g., LVAD, IABP).
  6. No right ventricular dysfunction.
  7. No intra-abdominal hypertension.

### Physiology
1. **Reduction of RV Stroke Volume During Inspiration with PPV**:
   - PPV reduces RV preload and increases afterload due to increased transpulmonary pressure during inspiration.
   - Minimum RV stroke volume at end-inspiration.
2. **Lag of Two or Three Heartbeats**:
   - Due to pulmonary blood transit time.
3. **Reduction of LV Preload and SV During Expiration with PPV**:
   - Inspiratory reduction in LV filling leads to decreased LV stroke volume, minimum during expiration.
   - Greater cyclic changes in RV and LV stroke volumes when operating on the steep part of the Frank-Starling curve.

### Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV), Systolic Blood Pressure Variation (SPV), and Stroke Volume Variation (SVV)
- **Pulse Pressure (PP)**: \(PP = \frac{SV}{C} \) (Stroke Volume / Compliance).
- **Respiratory Variation**: In stroke volume causes respiratory variation in systolic pressure (SPV) and pulse pressure (PPV).
- **Systolic Pressure Variation (SPV)**:
  - Calculated by measuring the difference between maximal and minimal systolic blood pressure (SBP) values during a single respiratory cycle and a reference value (SBP during an end-expiratory pause).
  - SPV can be eyeballed with relative accuracy.
- **PPV**:
  - PPV = PPmax - PPmin / mean
  - PPV is not affected by airway and pleural pressure.
- **SVV**:
  - Measured by continuous cardiac output monitoring, esophageal Doppler, or echocardiography.
  - SVV = SVmax - SVmin / mean

### Plethysmographic Dynamic Indices
- **Plethysmographic Waveform**: Similar to arterial waveform, providing information on volume responsiveness.
- Good indicators in mechanically ventilated patients without cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or spontaneous activity. Cut-off value: 9.1–15%.

### Echocardiographic Dynamic Indices
- **IVC Respiratory Variation**:
  - Measured 1 cm distal to its junction with hepatic vein.
  - DMax -D-min/Dmin X 100%
	- 18% threshold: 90% sensitivity and specificity.
  - ΔDivc = (Dmax–Dmin) / (Dmax + Dmin) /2]
	- 12% threshold: Positive predictive value 93%, negative predictive value 92%.
- **IVC Collapsibility**:
  - Measured in spontaneously breathing patients.
  - IVC = (Dmax) - D{min) / D{min) x 100%
  - 40% threshold: Associated with fluid responsiveness; 15% threshold: 100% negative predictive value.
- **Stroke Volume (SV) and SV Variation**:
  - Measure VTI and LVOT diameter.
  - SV = VTI × CSA
	  - CSA = 𝝅𝒓𝟐 -
	  - CO = SV × HR
  - SVV >12%: Accurately predicts fluid responsiveness.
- **Aortic Peak Velocity and VTI Variation**:
  - Peak velocity variation >12% and VTI variation: Predictive of fluid responsiveness.
  - SVmax - SVmin / mean

## Functional Hemodynamic Tests
- Determine the heart's position on the Frank-Starling curve at the bedside.
- **Fluid Challenge**:
  - Standard: 500 mL or 6–8 mL/kg fluid bolus over 10-30 minutes. An increase of at least 10% identifies fluid responsiveness.
  - Mini: 100–150 mL over 10 minutes. A change in cardiac output of ~5% is sought.
- **Passive Leg Raise (PLR)**:
  - Passive leg raising for ~5 minutes results in an auto-transfusion of ~300 mL of blood.
  - Measure cardiac output before and after; an increase of at least 10% is sought.
  - Can also measure a change in pulse pressure.
- **End-Expiratory Occlusion Test (EEOT)**:
  - Performed using the expiration hold function of the ventilator for 20 seconds, allowing for increased venous return and a blood bolus to the right and left heart.
  - Continuous cardiac output monitoring technique required for measurement.
## Monitoring Changes in Cardiac Output

   - **Uncalibrated Cardiac Output Monitors**: Vigileo
   - **Calibrated**: Lidco

3. **Non-invasive (no vascular catheters needed)**
   - **Pulse Wave Transit Time**
   - **Pulse Contour Analysis with Pulse Oximetry Plethysmographic Waveform**
   - **Carbon Dioxide Rebreathing**
   - **Thoracic Electrical Bioimpedance/Bioreactance Devices**
   - **Echocardiography**: Measuring subaortic VTI

## Controlled Conditions in Theatre
- Conditions are more controlled in theatre, making PPV a relatively precise and easy method for determining fluid responsiveness.
- If PPV >13%, administer a fluid bolus.
- If PPV is 8-12%, use other methods (e.g., end-expiratory occlusion test, fluid bolus) to determine fluid requirement.

## Assessment and Management of Fluid Responsiveness

### Step 1: Assess Acute Circulatory Failure
- **Question:** Is there acute circulatory failure?
  - Low blood pressure or cardiac output?
  - Signs of tissue hypoperfusion?

  **If No:**
  - Do not consider volume expansion.

  **If Yes:**
  - Proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Assess Hypovolemia
- **Question:** Is hypovolemia obvious?
  - Obvious fluid loss?
  - Initial phase of septic shock?

  **If Yes:**
  - Perform volume expansion (no need to test preload responsiveness).

  **If No:**
  - Proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Assess Preload Responsiveness
- **Question:** Is there preload responsiveness?

  **If Yes:**
  - Consider volume expansion (depending on the risk of fluid overload).

  **If No:**
  - Proceed to Step 4.

### Step 4: Assess Limiting Conditions
- **Question:** Are the following conditions present?
  - Spontaneous breathing?
  - Cardiac arrhythmias?
  - ARDS with low tidal volume/lung compliance?

  **If Yes:**
  - Use tests such as:
	- Passive leg raising test
	- End-expiratory occlusion test
	- "Mini" fluid challenge

  **If No:**
  - Use tests such as:
	- Pulse pressure or stroke volume variation
	- Respiratory variation of IVC/SVC
	- Passive leg raising test
	- End-expiratory occlusion test
	- "Mini" fluid challenge

  **Decision:**
  - **If Positive:** Consider volume expansion (depending on the risk of fluid overload).
  - **If Negative:** Do not consider volume expansion.

## Point-of-Care Ultrasound Fluid Resuscitation Guide

### Step 1: Perform Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE)
- **Look for signs of overt hypovolemia and fluid challenge accordingly:**
  - "Kissing ventricles"
  - Small hyperkinetic left/right ventricles
  - Small collapsible IVC

### Step 2: Review for Limiting Conditions
- **Conditions:**
  - Arrhythmia
  - Valvular conditions
  - Right ventricular failure
  - Left ventricular failure
  - Diastolic heart failure
  - Low tidal volume <7 mL/kg
  - Spontaneous breathing

  **If One of These Conditions Present:**
  - Do not consider volume expansion.

  **If None of These Conditions Present:**
  - Proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Consider Fluid Challenge
- **Criteria for Fluid Challenge:**
  - SVV >12%
  - LVOT VTI/Velocity with respiratory variation >20%
  - LVOT velocity beat-to-beat >12%
  - IVC distensibility index >18%

  **If Fluid Indicated Clinically and Criteria Met:**
  - Consider mini fluid challenge: 100 mL over 1 min. If LVOT VTI >10%, follow with a full fluid challenge.

  **After Fluid Challenge:**
  - **Assess for Increased LV Filling Pressures:**
	- LVEDP
	- E/A >2
	- E/e' >13
	- S/D <1
  - **If Increased:**
	- Consider the risk of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

### Step 4: Repeat Steps if Necessary
- **Continue until Fluid No Longer Indicated:**
  - Based on clinical and/or TTE assessment.
  - Consider other causes of shock.
  - Consider vasoactive drugs.

### Step 5: Continuous Monitoring
- **Continuous Cardiac Output Monitoring:**
  - Thermodilution/lithium/oesophageal Doppler.
  - Repeat TTE with changes in monitoring trends or clinical course.

# Important Fluid Trails

## CHEST TRAIL

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311155011.png)

**6S = HES vs RL in septic patients.**

	Outcome: Increased mortality and need for RRT in HES group.

	But: Age average 65yrs, focus on septic patients.

**RELIEF = Restrictive vs liberal fluid for abdominal surgery.**

	Outcome: Restrictive not associated with a higher rate of disability free survival. And was associated with increased rate of acute kidney injury.

	But: Age average 65yrs, Fluid balance differences 6L vs 3.7L. 6L is more of a modestly liberal approach.

**CHEST = HES vs 0.9% N.Saline in critically ill patients.**

	Outcome: HES no clinical benefit and has increased risk of RRT.

**SAFE =** No difference between 4% albumin vs 0.9% N.saline for fluid resus in ICU

**ALBIOS =** Albumin replacement in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: 20% Albumin vs crystalloid.

Outcome: Safe and improved haemodynamics but no mortality benefit. Targeting Albumin >30g/dl = no survivial advantage.
