# Perioperative Organ Injury

### Magnitude of Perioperative Mortality

**Three Leading Causes of Death in the United States (2006)**

1. Diseases of the heart (n = 631,636)
2. Malignant neoplasms (n = 559,888)
3. Cerebrovascular diseases (n = 137,119)

# Perioperative CVA/Stroke

## Definition
- **World Health Organization:** Stroke is defined as “rapidly developed clinical signs of focal or global disturbance of cerebral function, lasting more than 24 h or until death, with no apparent non-vascular cause.”

## Incidence
- **Noncardiac and Non-neurologic Surgery:** 0.1-0.7%
- **Higher-risk Procedures:**
  - Coronary artery bypass surgery: 1.6%
  - Cardiac valve surgery: 2.2%
- **Mortality Levels:** 12–32.6%

## Pathophysiology
- **Nature:** Most strokes are ischemic due to acute occlusion of a blood vessel.
- **Vascular Sources:** Commonly include proximal large arteries (e.g., internal carotid, aorta) and paradoxical embolization from a venous source via a right-to-left cardiac shunt.
- **Watershed Infarcts:** Occur in distal perfusion territories of cerebral arteries due to hypoperfusion and microembolization.
- **Timing:** Most strokes occur after an uneventful emergence from anesthesia and present on postoperative day 2.
- **Intraoperative Events:** Hypotension or thromboembolism from aortic manipulation during cardiac surgery can cause intraoperative strokes that manifest immediately after anesthesia.
- **Delayed Stroke Pathophysiology:** Likely has a different pathophysiology from intraoperative strokes.

### Brain's Inflammatory Response to Postischemic Reperfusion
- **Innate Immune Response:** Involves polynuclear cells, macrophages, and resident cells activated through damage-associated molecular patterns from damaged host cells.
- **Adaptive Immune Response:** Antigen-specific actions by lymphocytes that require more time to develop and induce memory.

### Major Surgery-Induced Inflammatory Profile
- **Acute Stress Response:** Contributes to a hypercoagulable and neuro-inflammatory milieu, impairing neuroprotective mechanisms, potentially leading to stroke.
### Activation of Regulatory T-Cells

#### Characteristics
- **Subpopulation:** Immuno-modulatory T-cells
- **Markers:** CD4, CD25
- **Transcription Factor:** FoxP3

#### Activation Process
- **Induction:** Binding of interleukin (IL)-2 to CD25
- **Hypoxic Conditions:** Enhances FoxP3 expression which regulates immuno-modulatory functions.

#### Functions
- **Neuroprotective Effects:** Augmentation of T-cell proliferation, synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10, TGF-β)

#### Clinical Application
- **Therapeutic Activation:** Exogenous administration of IL-2 for studying neuroprotective effects of regulatory T-cells in perioperative stroke.

## Prevention
- **Risk Factor Modification:** Lifestyle changes and medical therapy for hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension.
- **Patients with History of Cerebral Ischemia:** Maintained on lifelong lipid-lowering and antiplatelet therapy.
- **Intraoperative Hypotension:** Associated with stroke, but defining optimal blood pressure targets remains challenging.
- **New Approaches:** Use near-infrared spectroscopy to delineate patient-specific limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. Insight into intraoperative cerebral perfusion may tailor hemodynamic management, though studies have not yet linked monitoring of cerebral oxygenation to reliable prevention of neurologic injury.

## Treatment
- **Current Guidelines:** Emphasize early diagnosis and transfer to a stroke unit, general supportive therapy (e.g., airway management, mechanical ventilation), and avoidance of further cerebral insults (e.g., prevention of hyperthermia).
- **Endovascular Therapy:** Enthusiasm dampened by two trials showing no benefit compared to systemic thrombolysis. However, endovascular stroke therapy may still hold promise for select cases of perioperative stroke.
- **Targeting Immunologic Response:** Administering cytokine therapy to foster neuroprotective effects mediated by regulatory T-cells may be valuable for perioperative organ protection in the future.

## Neuroprotection

[Neuroprotection](Neuroprotection.md)

# Perioperative Myocardial Infarction

## Perioperative Myocardial Infarction (MI)

### Definition

MI is defined as an increased plasma cardiac troponin concentration that exceeds the 99th percentile of a normal reference population in conjunction with one of the following:

1. Symptoms of ischemia
2. ST-segment-T wave changes, new left bundle branch block, or development of pathological Q-waves on electrocardiogram
3. Evidence of new wall motion abnormalities or loss of viable myocardium on imaging
4. Detection of an intracoronary thrombus

### Incidence
- **Noncardiac Surgery:** The incidence of perioperative MI is 1–3%, associated with an increased risk for death.
- **30-Day Mortality:** A multicenter international cohort study of 8,351 surgical patients at risk for atherosclerotic disease reported a 30-day mortality of 11.6% in patients who suffered perioperative MI, compared with 2.2% in those who did not.

### Pathophysiology
- **Type 1 MI:**
  - Results from prolonged ischemia leading to cardiomyocyte death.
  - Typically due to acute intracoronary flow occlusion, usually secondary to the rupture of a fissured atherosclerotic plaque.
  - More commonly associated with intracoronary thrombus formation in nonsurgical MI.
  
- **Type 2 MI:**
  - Caused by a supply/demand mismatch not solely related to coronary artery disease.
  - Can result from conditions like anemia, arrhythmia, hypotension, or hypertension.
  - Common in the operating room and intensive care unit.
  - Angiographic studies show conflicting data on classification into type-1 versus type-2 MI.
  - Autopsy studies indicate plaque disruption in 46–55% of cases, but this may not represent the mechanism in the surviving majority of surgical patients.
  - Likely pathophysiology: A supply/demand mismatch in a hemodynamically unstable and hypercoagulable state, leading to cardiac ischemia, ST depression, cell death, and troponin increase.

### Prevention
- **Pharmacologic Approaches:** Include β-blockers, antiplatelet agents, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and nitrates.
- **Current Challenges:** Effective preemptive medical therapy for high-risk surgery patients is lacking. Perioperative β-blockade has not succeeded in decreasing postoperative mortality.

### Treatment
- **Invasive Options:** Catheter-based and operative revascularization techniques.
- **Support for Heart Failure:** Intra-aortic balloon pumps, ventricular assist devices, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) devices.
- **MI Progression:** Though severe heart failure in the immediate perioperative period is uncommon, myocardial injury leading to troponin increases is frequent and an independent predictor of mortality.
- **Cardio-protective Strategies:** Ongoing efforts to develop more effective strategies, including novel approaches using adenosine.

### Extracellular Adenosine Signaling and Its Termination

#### Source of Adenosine
- Enzymatic conversion of ATP and ADP to AMP via ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (CD39).
- Further conversion of AMP to adenosine through ecto-5’-nucleotidase (CD73).

#### Adenosine Receptors
- ADORA1 (A1)
- ADORA2A (A2A)
- ADORA2B (A2B)
- ADORA3 (A3)

#### Functional Role
- **Activation:** During intravenous administration of adenosine in supraventricular tachycardia.
- **Inflammation Attenuation:** By activation of A2A receptors in inflammatory cells like neutrophils and lymphocytes.

#### Therapeutic Evidence
- **Blockade of Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporters:** By dipyridamole increases extracellular adenosine concentration, protecting tissue from ischemia.

## Cardiac Protection

[Cardiac Protection](Cardiac%20protection.md)

# Perioperative-AKI

## Definition

Renal dysfunction is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. The KDIGO Classification Criteria for AKI are as follows:

**Stage 1:**

- **Serum [creatinine] increase:** 1.5–1.9 times baseline or ≥ 26.5 μmol·l^-1 (0.3 mg·dl^-1)
- **Urine output:** < 0.5 ml·kg^-1·h^-1 for 6–12 h

**Stage 2:**

- **Serum [creatinine] increase:** 2.0–2.9 times baseline
- **Urine output:** < 0.5 ml·kg^-1·h^-1 for ≥ 12 h

**Stage 3:**

- **Serum [creatinine] increase:** 3.0 times baseline or ≥ 353.6 μmol·l^-1 (4.0 mg·dl^-1)
- **Urine output:** < 0.3 ml·kg^-1·h^-1 for ≥ 24 h or anuria ≥ 12 h

## Major Risk Factors for Perioperative AKI

**Patient Factors:**

- Chronic diseases (Kidney, Heart failure, Hypertension)
- Peripheral arterial disease
- Obstructive pulmonary disease
- Diabetes mellitus
- Alcoholism
- Male gender
- Obesity
- Age > 65 years

**Surgery Factors:**

- Emergency surgery
- Non-renal solid organ transplant
- Cardiac bypass time
- Aortic cross clamp

**Other Factors:**

- Acute illness
- Sepsis
- Multi-organ dysfunction
- Nephrotoxic drugs (ACEi, ARB, Diuretics, Radio-opaque intravenous contrast)

## Diagnosis

**Problems with Perioperative Diagnosis:**

- **Preoperative Creatinine Concentration:** The diagnosis of acute postoperative kidney injury cannot be made without the pre-operative creatinine concentration. Calculations that estimate the preoperative creatinine concentration overestimate the prevalence of postoperative AKI.
- **eGFR Calculations:** The diagnosis of AKI is less reliable than the staging of chronic kidney disease; acute changes in serum creatinine concentrations inaccurately convert to eGFR. Critically ill patients have reduced muscle bulk, and septic patients generate less creatinine, leading to an overestimated glomerular filtration rate by standard equations.
- **Timing:** Kidney injury precedes increases in creatinine concentration.
- **Prognostic Interpretation:** The prognostic interpretation of changing serum creatinine concentration is context-sensitive. For example, a fall in creatinine was associated with poor outcomes in postoperative cardiothoracic patients.
- **Urine Output:** Diagnosis of AKI also incorporates urine output. Patients who meet both criteria for AKI do worse than patients who are not oliguric. In the postoperative period, oliguria is often secondary to normal physiological responses to tissue damage, pain, and mild hypovolemia or hypotension. Oliguria is common but not usually followed by raised creatinine.

## Pathophysiology

- **Arterial Hypotension:** Reduces the normal net pressure of 25 mmHg that drives ultrafiltrate through the glomerulus, decreasing with lower cardiac output.
- **Causes:** Reduced ultrafiltration is rarely the sole cause of AKI; inflammation, direct vascular injury, or tubular obstruction (e.g., cholesterol emboli, rhabdomyolysis) usually accompany perioperative kidney injury.
- **Cell Disruption:** Disruption of intercellular tight junctions leads to the shedding of cells into the tubular lumen and loss of transmembrane ion channel polarity.
- **Intratubular Pressure:** Elevated intratubular pressure decreases glomerular filtration and activation of tubule-glomerular feedback, leading to pre-glomerular vasoconstriction and further reduction in glomerular filtration.

### Activation of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)

**Mechanism:**

- **Hypoxic Conditions:** HIF-α and HIF-β translocate into the cell nucleus, binding to the DNA hypoxia response promoter element, inducing expression of hypoxia-sensitive genes.
- **Normoxic Conditions:** Prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) hydroxylate HIF-α, marking it for proteasomal degradation.

**Inhibition:**

- **Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors:** Prevent HIF-α degradation, activating hypoxia-activated signaling pathways even under normoxic conditions (e.g., FG-2216).

## Protective Strategies

#### Pre-operative

- Modify risk factors for kidney injury such as chronic hypertension, poor diabetic control, and nephrotoxic drugs to reduce individual risk.
- Enhanced recovery protocols should ensure a hydrated euvolemic patient before surgery.

#### Intra-operative

- Maintenance of cardiac output and renal perfusion may reduce perioperative renal injury.
- Brief episodes of mean arterial pressures less than 55 mmHg are associated with kidney injury.
- Goal-directed infusion of fluids, packed red cells, and inotropes to reach predetermined target hemodynamic goals, whether administered before, during, or after surgery, may prevent postoperative organ dysfunction.

# Perioperative Acute Gut Injury

## Incidence

- **Clinically Overt AGI:** After major nonabdominal surgery, such as cardiopulmonary bypass or lung transplantation surgery, the incidence ranges from 0.3–6.1%, with significant morbidity and a high mortality risk (18–58%).

## Pathophysiology

- **Specific Factors:** For example, the altered coagulation state after cardiopulmonary bypass may influence gastrointestinal bleeding.
- **Splanchnic Perfusion Abnormalities:** Central common pathophysiologic insult involving mucosal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.
- **Intestinal Mucosa Vasculature:** Supported by a complex vasculature; in low-flow states (e.g., shock, cardiopulmonary bypass), oxygen is shunted away from the villus tip via a countercurrent mechanism, exposing the epithelium to significant hypoxia.
- **Mesenteric Ischemia:** The most extensive form of intestinal hypoperfusion.

### Role of Paneth Cells and Intestinal Mast Cells in Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury

**Paneth Cell-Dependent Pathway:**

- **Location:** Base of small intestinal crypts.
- **Mediator:** Interleukin (IL)-17.
- **Effect:** Regulation of local injury and systemic inflammation following intestinal ischemia/reperfusion.

**Mast Cell Responses:**

- **Preformed Products:**
	- Proteases (tryptase)
	- Mast cell protease (MCP)-4
- **Lipid Mediators:**
	- Leukotrienes
	- Prostaglandins
- **Cytokines:**
	- Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α
	- IL-6

The Paneth cell-dependent pathway relies on IL-17 release, while mast cell responses involve various preformed and de novo synthesized products, playing crucial roles in managing local injury and systemic inflammation post-intestinal ischemia/reperfusion.

# Perioperative Lung Protection Strategies

1. **Epidural Anaesthesia:**
	
	- Reduces systemic opioid use and its associated complications.
	- Provides effective analgesia, which can improve respiratory mechanics and reduce pulmonary complications.
2. **Restrictive Fluid Strategy:**
	
	- Minimizes fluid overload, reducing the risk of pulmonary edema.
	- Maintains adequate organ perfusion while avoiding excessive fluid administration.
3. **Physiotherapy:**
	
	- Encourages deep breathing exercises and early mobilization.
	- Helps in preventing atelectasis and other pulmonary complications.
4. **Smoking Cessation:**
	
	- Reduces respiratory complications and improves overall surgical outcomes.
	- Ideally, should be initiated well before the planned surgery.
5. **Lung Protective Ventilation:**
	
	- Utilizes low tidal volumes and appropriate levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
	- Aims to reduce ventilator-associated lung injury.
6. **Avoiding Long-Acting Neuromuscular Blocking Agents (NMBA):**
	
	- Reduces the risk of prolonged muscle weakness and associated respiratory complications.
	- Prefer shorter-acting agents or agents that can be rapidly reversed.
# Peri-operative Liver Protection and Monitoring

## Perioperative Liver Protection and Monitoring

It is estimated that 10% of patients with advanced liver disease undergo surgery in the last two years of their lives. The presence of cirrhosis, even in non-hepatic surgery, increases mortality 4-5 fold (12% 30-day mortality) and has substantial morbidity (>30%), particularly cardio-respiratory.

### Assessment of the Patient for Liver Resection

Determining how much liver can safely be resected in a particular patient is challenging.

- **Healthy Patients:** Up to 80% liver resection may be tolerated with normal residual parenchyma. The absolute minimum residual volume is 300 ml/m² BSA.
- **Patients with Co-morbidities or Liver Dysfunction:** Even a 40% resection may not be tolerated.

#### Predictive Approach

A three-pronged approach is utilized:

1. **Assessment of Extra-Hepatic Co-morbidity:** Including advanced age and awareness of chronic liver disease co-morbidities (e.g., hyperdynamic circulation, cardiomyopathy, hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension, renal disease, coagulopathy).
2. **Accurate Tumor Assessment:** Using high-definition radiology to predict the extent of resection.
3. **Assessment of Residual Liver Function:** Elimination of reversible factors poses the greatest challenge. Prognostic factors include:
   - **Child-Turcotte-Pugh Category A:** Favorable levels of bilirubin and albumin, absence of encephalopathy and ascites, good nutrition, no bleeding with normal prothrombin time.
   - **Absence of Portal Hypertension:** No splenomegaly, varices, and normal platelet count, normal portal pressures on ultrasound.
   - **Normal Biopsy of Uninvolved Liver:** If there are concerns regarding its function.

Quantitative assessment of liver function includes:

1. **Liver Blood Flow:** Assessed by indocyanine green clearance assay.
2. **Liver Cell Function:** Assessed by MEGX clearance.

Despite the availability of these tests, clinical assessment remains paramount, and the incidence of liver failure post-resection is less than 2%.

### Reversible Factors

Correcting reversible factors may reduce surgical risk:

1. **Jaundice:** Associated with poor prognosis unless obstructive and remedied with preoperative stenting.
2. **Renal Dysfunction:** Multifactorial causes need addressing, including volume status and creatinine clearance.
3. **Coagulopathy:** Guided correction reduces surgical bleeding and allows neuraxial techniques.
4. **Ascites:** Managed to prevent interference with respiratory mechanics and renal failure.
5. **Encephalopathy:** Correction of preoperative encephalopathy reduces postoperative risk.

## Liver Protection and Physiology

### Blood Supply and Ischemia

The liver receives 1 ml/g of liver tissue blood flow, accounting for 25% of cardiac output. It has two blood supplies: the portal vein (75% of blood flow) and the hepatic artery (50% of oxygen supply).

#### Functional Zones
- **Zone 1:** Peri-portal hepatocytes specialized in oxidative metabolism and glycogen synthesis.
- **Zone 2:** Contains enzymes of the urea cycle.
- **Zone 3:** Involved in anaerobic metabolism and drug biotransformation, sensitive to ischemia and toxic intermediates.

#### Hepatic Arterial Buffer Response
- Compensates for a reduction of up to 30% in portal venous flow by dilating hepatic arterioles in response to increased adenosine production.

### Metabolic Responses to Ischemia

Hepatic ischemia often occurs during resection, particularly affecting zone 3 hepatocytes.

- **Metabolic Consequences:**
  - Reduced lactate clearance and drug metabolism.
  - Failure in synthetic function (decreased albumin, clotting factors, increased ammonia).
  - Failure in excretory function (increased bilirubin).
  - Membrane failure and hepatocyte necrosis.

### Perioperative Liver Monitoring

In the absence of direct hepatic function monitors, a combination of tests is used:

1. **Serum Lactate:** Indicator of reduced hepatocyte function.
2. **Ammonia:** Sensitive indicator of liver ischemia.
3. **Clotting Studies:** PT/INR and thromboelastogram.
4. **Blood Sugar:** Monitored for hypoglycemia.
5. **Transaminases:** Elevated after liver dysfunction.
6. **Infectious Markers:** CRP or PCT may elevate due to Kupffer cell malfunction.
7. **SvO₂:** Fall in value during resection indicates maximal liver O₂ extraction.

## Perioperative Liver Protection

### Strategies

1. **Maximize Residual Liver Volume:**
   - Up to 60% resection is generally safe unless underlying liver function is deranged.
   - Preoperative portal vein embolization can promote hypertrophy of residual liver.

2. **Adequate Oxygen Delivery:**
   - Maintenance of normal cardiac output and systemic blood pressure.
   - Reduce hepatic vascular resistance (e.g., manage CVP, avoid excessive PEEP).
   - Maintain normoxaemia/increased PaO₂ and appropriate hemoglobin concentration.

3. **Enhance Tolerance of Ischemia:**
   - **Surgical:** Intermittent clamping and unclamping (ischemic preconditioning).
   - **Pharmacological:** Agents like sevoflurane induce protective effects.
   - **Gene Therapy:** Experimental approaches to introduce protective genes.

4. **Avoid Hepatotoxins:**
   - Avoid drugs that require extensive hepatic biotransformation or are hepatotoxic.
   - Avoid paracetamol until normal liver function is confirmed postoperatively.
   - Use alternatives to known hepatotoxins, such as halothane.

### Specific Techniques
1. **Maintain Normal Cardiac Output and BP:** May require inotropic support.
2. **Reduce Hepatic Vascular Resistance:** Manage autonomic tone, ventilatory pressures, and temperature.
3. **Maintain Normoxaemia/Increased PaO₂:** Requires higher FIO₂ during resection.
4. **Maintain Hemoglobin Concentration:** Strategies to limit or compensate for surgical bleeding, such as local vascular clamping and bloodless dissection techniques.
