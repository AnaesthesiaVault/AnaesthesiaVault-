# Cerebral Oximetry

![](Pasted%20image%2020240712105129.png)

## Introduction
- Cerebral monitoring can serve as an early alert for impending organ dysfunction.
- The cerebral cortex is highly susceptible to oxygen supply and demand changes with limited oxygen reserves.
- Cerebral oximetry (CO) estimates regional tissue oxygenation via transcutaneous measurement through the cerebral cortex.

## Mechanism of Action
- Cerebral oximeters use adhesive sensors over the frontal lobes, emitting and capturing reflected light based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
- CO relies on light penetration through the skull to measure hemoglobin oxygenation in the brain tissue by the light absorption of hemoglobin.
- NIRS employs two photodetectors with each light source to sample tissue selectively beyond a specified skin depth.
- Near-field photodetection is subtracted from far-field photodetection for selective tissue oxygenation measurement.
- Tissue sampling is primarily venous (70–75%) rather than arterial (25%) blood.
- CO is independent of pulsatile blood flow.
- Unlike pulse oximetry monitoring arterial blood hemoglobin saturation (SpO2), cerebral oximetry monitors mixed arterial, venous, and capillary blood saturation in cerebral tissue (SctO2).

## Determinants of SctO2
- SctO2 depends on the ratio of arterial, venous, and capillary blood volumes in the illuminated brain region.
- SctO2 increases with a higher ratio of saturated arterial blood to desaturated venous blood and decreases with the opposite.
- Blood volume percentages vary interindividually, across different brain regions, and with hypoxia, hyper-/hypocapnia, neural excitation, and vasoconstrictor use.
- SctO2 also depends on the balance between cerebral oxygen supply and demand.
- Cerebral oxygen supply is determined by cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial blood oxygen content.
- In stable arterial blood content, increased CBF raises arterial blood volume, shifting the volume ratio towards arterial blood.
- Cerebral oxygen demand is determined by the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). An increase in CMRO2 shifts the volume ratio towards venous blood.
- When CMRO2, arterial blood content, and blood compartment volumes are stable, SctO2 serves as a surrogate for cerebral perfusion.

## Response to Low NIRS Readings
- If NIRS drops >20% from baseline: reduce elevation angle, increase end-tidal CO2, and consider vasopressors (note: phenylephrine may decrease rScO2 saturations).
- MAP >20% baseline: consider ephedrine over phenylephrine, or adrenaline.

## Clinical Applications
### Cardiac Surgery
- CO can indicate the adequacy of tissue perfusion and oxygenation in vital organs.
- The cerebral frontal cortex, sensitive to oxygen saturation changes, provides early warnings of compromised oxygen delivery.
- Maintaining preoperative saturation levels below 75% reduced ICU time and morbidity/mortality.
- CO can predict lower autoregulation limits during cardiopulmonary bypass.

### Cerebral Vascular, Geriatric, and Thoracic Surgery
- Pre-induction or intraoperative rSO2 decreases guide blood pressure management or elective shunting in carotid endarterectomy.
- Treating rSO2 values below 75% in general and geriatric surgeries improves Mini-Mental State Examination scores and reduces PACU stay.
- Early cognitive dysfunction post-thoracic surgery with single lung ventilation correlates with intraoperative rSO2 decline.

### Trauma
- NIRS cerebral oximetry correlates with cerebral blood flow in brain-injured trauma patients.
- It provides valuable information at the scene and en route to the hospital.
- CO may predict mortality and CPR adequacy post-cardiac arrest.

### Beach Chair Position
- CO can guide interventions to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion and oxygenation.

## Normal Values
- Normal SctO2 baseline values range from 60–80%. A decrease of >25% or >20% from baseline, or SctO2 <40%, indicates the need for intervention.

## Interventions
- **Increase oxygen delivery to the brain:**
	- Increase cerebral perfusion pressure (below autoregulation limits if intact, or regardless if impaired).
	- Augment cardiac output.
	- Avoid hyperventilation/hypocapnia; maintain PaCO2 ≥ 40 mmHg.
	- Administer cerebral vasodilators or inhalational anesthetics (<1 MAC).
	- Optimize head position for cerebral venous outflow.
	- Consider reverse Trendelenburg position.
- **Improve arterial blood oxygen content:**
	- Increase inspired oxygen fraction.
	- Consider red blood cell transfusion if necessary.
- **Reduce cerebral oxygen consumption:**
	- Deepen anesthesia to lower CMRO2 until EEG becomes isoelectric, avoiding excessive depth to prevent hypotension and loss of autoregulation.

## Specific Interventions
- **Cardiac Surgery:**
	- Correct patient/cannula positioning, increase BP, cardiac output or CPB flow (>2.5 L/m2/min), FiO2, PaCO2 (>40 mmHg), administer anesthesia/muscle relaxants, and consider RBC transfusion (hematocrit <20%).
- **Carotid Endarterectomy:**
	- Same as cardiac surgery except for CPB-related measures, plus elective shunting if rSO2 is low on one side.

## Errors and Limitations
- Factors affecting accuracy include blood flow abnormalities, hemoglobin issues, systemic vasoconstrictors, skin pigmentation, and anatomical variations like skull thickness and frontal sinus.
- Bilirubin (levels >370 mmol/L) and tissue pigment deposits can interfere with spectrophotometry.

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of cerebral monitoring, highlighting its mechanisms, clinical applications, normal values, interventions, and potential errors.

# EEG

## Introduction
- Electroencephalography (EEG) is a bilateral, multichannel recording displaying normal (i.e., nonpathologic) waveforms originating from the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex.
- Each EEG electrode captures electrical activity from the underlying 1-inch square cerebral cortex.
- Multiple electrodes recording several channels simultaneously are required to represent the brain's electrical activity accurately.
- EEG signals are classified into four frequency bands:
  - **Alpha**: 8–13 Hz
  - **Beta**: >13 Hz
  - **Theta**: 4–7 Hz
  - **Delta**: <4 Hz
- In a non-anesthetized individual, normal EEG can display waveforms in any of these categories. However, the location of the recording (e.g., posterior vs frontal), age of the individual, and conscious state are critical factors in determining the normalcy of a particular frequency band.

## How It Works
- EEG electrodes are placed on the scalp at precise locations based on their distance from standard landmarks, with the International 10–20 system being the most common method, employing 21 electrodes.
- Electrodes are labeled with a letter followed by a number. Letters indicate the scalp region: frontal (F), parietal (P), frontal polar (Fp), temporal (T), occipital (O), and central (C). Auricular (A) electrodes serve as reference points.
- Odd and even numbers following the letters indicate left and right-sided placement, respectively. Smaller numbers indicate closer proximity to the midline.
- Midline electrodes are labeled with a "z" instead of a number (e.g., Fz for "frontal midline").
- Labels of individual channels indicate the active (recording) electrode followed by the reference electrode. If both are active electrodes, it is a "bipolar" montage (e.g., Fp1-F7). If the reference electrode is non-cephalic, it is a "referential" montage (e.g., Fp1-A1).
- In a typical setup, there are 20 bipolar channels arranged as follows: 5 left-hemispheric (starting with Fp1-F7), 5 right-hemispheric (starting with Fp2-F8), 4 left-hemispheric (starting with Fp1-F3), 4 right-hemispheric (starting with Fp2-F4), and 2 midline (Fz-Cz and Cz-Pz) channels.
- Additionally, one EKG lead assists with artifact rejection, and two ocular electrodes document eye opening/closure, an essential factor for analysis.

## Waveforms
- **Beta and Alpha Frequencies**: Predominantly beta and alpha frequencies are present in normal EEG recordings.
  - **Beta Waves**: Low voltage with frequencies >13 Hz, commonly seen in frontal channels (e.g., Fp1-F7).
  - **Alpha Waves**: Higher voltage with frequencies of 8–13 Hz, typically observed in posterior channels (e.g., T5-O1).
- Ocular electrodes (last two channels) indicating closed eyes show a normal pattern (alpha dominance in posterior channels) in healthy adults who are awake with eyes closed.
- Symmetry between corresponding channels on the left and right hemispheres indicates a normal EEG.

#### Burst Suppression Pattern
- This pattern can result from high doses of certain anesthetic drugs (iatrogenic) or disease processes (pathologic).
  - **Inhalation Anesthetics**: Isoflurane and sevoflurane can cause burst suppression at higher doses, typically around 1.3 MAC, but even around 1 MAC in elderly or critically ill patients.
  - **Intravenous Anesthetics**: Barbiturates, propofol, and etomidate can induce burst suppression at high plasma concentrations.
- Short periods of burst suppression may be unintentionally observed during anesthesia but can be intentionally induced for brain protection during procedures where ischemic brain injury is possible, such as temporary clip application during cerebral aneurysm clipping, usually achieved by continuous infusion of an intravenous agent like pentobarbital.
- Burst suppression due to underlying pathology is typically an ominous sign, seen in critically ill patients with hypoxemia and hypotension.
# SSEP

## SSEP

### Introduction
- Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP) is a neuromonitoring technique involving the repetitive stimulation of peripheral nerves and recording responses at various points along the signal propagation pathway.
- Typically, recordings are obtained at three points: on the peripheral nerve at a proximal level, the brainstem, and the cerebral cortex.
- SSEP monitoring assesses the integrity of the peripheral nerve, sensory tracts of the spinal cord, and the sensory cortex.
- For perioperative monitoring, SSEP signals during surgery are compared to baseline signals obtained immediately before surgery. The most current tracings (green and yellow lines) are displayed with the baseline tracings (red and white) for comparison.
- Signals (peaks and troughs) are marked with a letter and a number:
  - **Letter**: Direction of the signal (N for negative, P for positive).
  - **Amplitude**: Height of the signal (in microvolts).
  - **Latency**: Duration (in milliseconds) from the stimulus delivery to signal detection.
- Example signals for the median nerve: N13 (brainstem) and N20 (cerebral cortex). For the tibial nerve: N9 (popliteal fossa), N28 (brainstem), and N45 (cerebral cortex).

### Motor Evoked Potential
- Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) tracing supplements SSEP monitoring for a comprehensive view of spinal cord function, particularly during complex spinal surgeries.
- MEPs are valuable in cerebral cortex monitoring and can decrease false negatives in detecting cortical ischemia during procedures like carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
- MEP monitoring involves transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex and eliciting muscle contraction.
- Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBs) can interfere with MEPs, so avoiding or carefully managing partial neuromuscular block (e.g., three-fourths in a train-of-four stimulation) is crucial.
- Anesthetic agents affecting MEPs are similar to those affecting SSEPs: volatile agents and nitrous oxide are detrimental, whereas total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and opioid is preferred.

### Types of Surgery for Using SSEPs
- SSEP can monitor any structure from the point of stimulus to the sensory cerebral cortex.
- Common applications:
  - **Cerebrovascular surgery**: To monitor the cerebral cortex.
  - **Spinal surgery**: To monitor the posterior one-third of the spinal cord (ascending sensory neurons).
  - **Thoracic aorta surgery**: To ensure spinal cord perfusion.
- Less common applications: Peripheral nerves and their plexi (e.g., median nerve/brachial plexus) can be monitored.
- For cerebral cortex monitoring, both upper and lower extremity nerves can be used, and the cortical signals on the ipsilateral side of the surgery are monitored for significant changes.
- For spinal cord monitoring, upper extremity stimulation detects issues above the C6 level, so lower extremity stimulation is the norm for comprehensive monitoring.

### Significant Change
- A significant change in an SSEP signal is defined as a >50% decrease in amplitude or a >10% increase in latency.
  - Example: N45 signal for the left tibial nerve SSEPs with an amplitude of 1 μV and latency of 45 ms. A significant change occurs if amplitude decreases to <0.5 μV or latency exceeds 49.5 ms.
- Upon detecting a significant change, the surgeon and anesthesiologist should be immediately notified to review potential causes and agree on an action plan before irreversible damage occurs.

### Anesthetic Agents and SSEP
- Anesthetic agents profoundly affect SSEP:
  - **Halogenated agents**: Decrease amplitude and increase latency dose-dependently.
  - **Nitrous oxide**: Has more profound effects than halogenated agents.
  - **Opioids and IV hypnotics (barbiturates, propofol, midazolam)**: May cause a small decrease in amplitude but do not affect latency.
  - **NMBs**: Do not directly affect SSEPs but improve signal quality by eliminating EMG-related artifacts.
  - **Ketamine and etomidate**: Increase cortical SSEP signal amplitude, useful when baseline signals are low.
- TIVA is the preferred technique for facilitating SSEP monitoring. Avoid nitrous oxide and use the smallest possible doses of halogenated agents if preferred. Maintain stable anesthetic agent concentrations during critical parts of surgery to avoid masking or mimicking surgical insult changes.

### Physiological Variables Affecting SSEPs
- Amplitude of SSEP signals, especially cortical, decreases with age, making it challenging to obtain good baseline signals in the elderly.
- **Hypothermia**: Every 1 °C decrease in body temperature increases cortical signal latency by 0.75–1 ms.
- **Hypotension**: Decreases amplitude and increases latency. Systolic blood pressure above 80 mmHg generally does not cause changes, but some individuals may need higher pressures to preserve signals.
- Maintain stable temperature and blood pressure during critical parts of SSEP monitoring to avoid confounding effects.
# Bispectral Index

## Introduction
- The bispectral index (BIS) monitor is a processed EEG tool designed to objectively monitor the effects of anesthetic medications.
- A single EEG channel is obtained through skin electrodes on the forehead and analyzed by the monitor.
- The BIS computation involves several steps: artifact detection, power spectrum analysis, suppression detection, and fast Fourier transformation.
- The result is the BIS value, a unitless number between 0 and 99. The monitor also displays the signal quality index (SQI), a semiquantitative EMG display, and a real-time EEG graph.
- The suppression ratio (percentage of isoelectric EEG over a unit time) can be displayed by enabling this variable.
- A moving trend of BIS is displayed at the screen's lower part for an overview. Although the algorithm filters EMG signals, their presence can introduce artifacts and falsely elevate BIS values.

## Zones of Clinical State
- BIS values (0–99) can be divided into zones reflecting different clinical states of alertness and sedation:
  - **92–99**: Awake individual EEG waveform.
  - **High 80s to low 90s**: Light sedation.
  - **Mid-80s**: Conscious sedation (responds to loud calling of their name).
  - **High 70s to low 80s**: Deep sedation (responds to shaking, potential airway obstruction).
  - **Below mid-70s**: Anesthetized state.
- There is interindividual overlap between BIS ranges and sedation degrees.
- **45–60**: General anesthesia. BIS specifically measures the hypnotic component of anesthesia through cerebral cortical electrical activity. Movement in response to surgical stimulus is mediated by the spinal cord, so immobility is not guaranteed even at the lower end of this range.
- **<60**: Highly unlikely to experience explicit recall regardless of anesthetic regimen.
- **<45**: Deep hypnotic state, associated with side effects such as hypotension and prolonged recovery, and increased long-term mortality with prolonged BIS <45.
- **30**: Burst suppression pattern onset, with suppression ratio increasing to 100% as BIS decreases to 0. BIS is useful for cerebral protection via induced burst suppression.

## Effects of Drugs
- BIS is useful for monitoring the hypnotic effect of volatile anesthetics (isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane), propofol, and etomidate.
- Dexmedetomidine's effects on BIS are also reflected.
- Nitrous oxide and opioids' effects on hypnotic agents are not reliably shown on BIS.
- Ketamine can paradoxically increase BIS; lower doses may not affect BIS.

## Indications
- BIS is not routinely indicated for all general anesthesia patients.
- It is useful for monitoring the hypnotic component of general anesthesia with volatile anesthetics and total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol.
- BIS use may reduce the risk of awareness, decrease anesthetic consumption, and modestly improve recovery profiles (time to eye opening, extubation, orientation).

## Conditions Affecting BIS
- EMG activity (30–200 Hz) is faster than EEG (0.5–30 Hz). Facial muscle EMG activity can create artifacts, leading to erroneously higher BIS values. Reviewing the EMG display helps rule out this artifact. NMBs can eliminate this artifact for accurate BIS measurement.
- Electrocautery units (ECU), especially unipolar devices used for >5 seconds, can render meaningful BIS measurements impossible, reflected by decreased SQI values. Interpretation should be postponed until SQI improves.
- Beta-receptor agonists (e.g., isoproterenol) and antagonists (e.g., esmolol) can increase or decrease BIS values, respectively, though clinical implications are unclear.
- Hypotension and hypothermia decrease BIS, likely due to decreased cerebral metabolic rate.
- Baseline BIS values are often lower in children with cerebral palsy (75–90) and elderly with dementia. Anesthetic administration decreases these values further, complicating interpretation since algorithms are validated in individuals without brain pathology.
# Cardiac Output Monitors

## Cardiac Output Monitors

### Minimally Invasive CO

#### Introduction
- The figures above depict a patient with low urine output before and after a fluid challenge. The cardiac output/cardiac index increased, while the stroke volume variation (SVV) decreased from 19% to 6%.
- The patient’s urine output improved, indicating better kidney perfusion following the fluid challenge.

#### Importance of Monitoring CO
- Monitoring cardiac output (CO) is essential in anesthesia and critical care for assessing cardiac function, tissue perfusion, and oxygen delivery.
- CO is used as a marker of oxygen delivery to tissues, calculated as:
	- **DO2 = CO × (1.39 × [Hb] × SaO2 + (0.003 × PaO2))**
	- **DO2**: Rate of oxygen delivery
	- **CO**: Cardiac output
	- **Hb**: Hemoglobin concentration
	- **SaO2**: Hemoglobin oxygen saturation (fraction)
	- **PaO2**: Partial pressure of oxygen in blood
- CO measurement can identify patients at risk for morbidity and/or mortality.
- It guides treatment with fluid resuscitation and/or vasoactive/inotropic drugs.

#### Advantages of FloTrac
- FloTrac/EV1000 system advantages:
	- No central line required
	- Any arterial line location can be used, easy to set up
	- No external calibration required
	- Software corrects for vascular tone and arterial cannulation site every 60 seconds
	- Waveform analysis every 20 seconds, eliminating extrasystoles and small artifacts
	- Optional central venous pressure attachment for SVR/SVRI calculation and PreSep catheter for continuous ScvO2 monitoring
	- Calculates stroke volume variation (SVV) to assess volume status

#### Estimation of SV
- FloTrac system uses pulse contour analysis with patient demographics and physical characteristics for arterial impedance estimation and stroke volume (SV) calculation.
- The principle is the linear relation between pulse pressure and SV.
- SV is estimated using:
	- **SV = SDap × X**
	- **SDap**: Standard deviation of 2000 data points (reflects pulse pressure)
	- **X**: Conversion factor (depends on arterial compliance, mean arterial pressure, waveform characteristics, adjusted by software every 60 seconds)
- SV is multiplied by heart rate to calculate CO.

#### Limitations
- Accuracy of FloTrac/EV1000, especially for SVV monitoring, may be compromised in:
	- Poor signal
	- Intra-aortic balloon pump
	- Ventricular assist device
	- Open chest, spontaneous breathing
	- Small tidal volumes
	- Arrhythmia
	- Poor lung compliance
	- High PEEP
	- Severe obesity
	- Medications (norepinephrine, vasodilators, beta-blockers)

#### Other Monitors
- Minimally invasive CO monitors using pulse contour analysis:
	- **Uncalibrated**: FloTrac, PulsioFlex, LiDCOrapid, PRAM, Nexfin, esCCO
	- **Calibrated**: PiCCO plus, LiDCOplus
- Other principles: pulse Doppler technology, applied Fick principle, bioimpedance/bioreactance

##### Calibrated Monitors
###### PiCCO plus
- Uses pulse contour analysis and transpulmonary thermodilution for intermittent calibration.
- Involves cold injectate in superior vena cava and detection by thermistor in aorta/major arterial branch.
- Measures global end-diastolic volume, intrathoracic blood volume, extravascular lung water, pulmonary vascular permeability index.

###### LiDCOplus Monitor
- Uses lithium dilution technique for intermittent calibration, generating a curve for CO calculation based on pulse power analysis.
- Uses PulseCO algorithm for pulse pressure analysis.

##### Uncalibrated Monitors
###### PulsioFlex
- Uses ProAQT sensor connected to peripheral arterial catheter, analyzing arterial waveform 250 times per second with patient biometrics.

###### LiDCOrapid
- Uses LiDCOplus technology but with nomograms for CO calculation.

###### PRAM
- Uses mathematical assessment of arterial line pressure signal for SV and CO estimation.

###### Nexfin Monitor
- Uses an inflatable cuff around the finger to generate a pressure waveform, constructing a brachial artery waveform for continuous CO calculation.

###### esCCO Monitor
- Derives CO using pulse wave transit time (PWTT) obtained from pulse oximetry and ECG signals, completely noninvasive.

##### Other Methods
###### Pulse Doppler Technology
- Uses esophageal or transthoracic Doppler probes to estimate CO by multiplying aorta cross-sectional area by blood flow velocity.

###### Applied Fick Principle
- Used in the NICO system, calculating CO2 production and elimination every 3 minutes to estimate CO.

###### Electrical Bioimpedance
- Uses electric current stimulation to identify thoracic/body impedance variations induced by blood flow changes per heartbeat, continuously estimating CO.
- Electrodes can be placed on skin or endotracheal tubes.
- Bioreactance technique requires further validation studies.

### SVV
- Stroke volume variation (SVV) estimates fluid responsiveness in ventilated patients with low preload, guiding fluid resuscitation.
- Cyclic changes in intrathoracic pressure during positive pressure ventilation induce SV and pulse pressure variation (PPV).
- SVV represents SV variability during a respiratory cycle, increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration (opposite in spontaneous ventilation).
- Calculated as:
	- **SVV = (SV max–SV min) / SV mean**
	- SVV >13% (10–15%) suggests potential preload responsiveness.
- Increased intrathoracic pressure initially increases preload, decreases afterload, and improves left ventricular compliance, followed by a decrease in venous return and SV.
- In the ascending limb of the Frank-Starling curve, pronounced SVV indicates low preload (fluid responsiveness). In the shallow part, small SVV indicates no fluid responsiveness.
# Peripheral Nerve Stimulator

[Neuromuscular monitoring](https://onepagericu.com/bistof)

## Peripheral Nerve Stimulators

### Introduction
- Neuromuscular monitoring should be used alongside other clinical signs of muscle recovery, such as grip strength, sustained head lift, and respiratory mechanics.

### Types
- Neuromuscular function is monitored intraoperatively by evaluating the muscular response to supramaximal stimulation of a peripheral motor nerve. Two types of stimulation are used:
  - **Electrical Nerve Stimulation**: Most commonly used clinically.
  - **Magnetic Stimulation**: Less painful and does not require body contact but is impractical due to equipment bulk and difficulty in monitoring train-of-four (TOF) responses.
- **Electromyography (EMG)**: Measures the action potential in a nerve.
- **Mechanomyography (MMG)**: Electrodes measure evoked muscle response, mainly used in research.
- **Acceleromyography (AMG)**: Measures acceleration of a digit using Newton's second law (force = mass × acceleration).
- **Kinemyography**: Uses piezoelectric crystals in the groove between thumb and index finger to sense voltage.
- **Phonomyography (PMG)**: Measures sounds of muscle contraction.

### Ideal Nerve Stimulator
- Should provide a constant current, generate supramaximal stimulus, and have a monophasic square/rectangular waveform.
- Must maintain appropriate stimulus duration, be portable, have multiple modes, default to lower current settings for regional nerve stimulation, and have warnings for undelivered current.
- Should include a polarity indicator with the negative electrode placed distally for the best response.

### How It Works
- The reaction of a single muscle fiber to an electrical stimulus is all-or-none. The muscle response decreases with more blocked fibers in response to neuromuscular blocking agents.
- A supramaximal stimulus (20-25% above the maximal response) ensures a consistent response, even though it is painful.
- A current of uniform amplitude (20–60 mA) at a short duration (0.1–0.2 ms) is applied to a peripheral nerve, and the motor response is observed at common sites like the facial and ulnar nerves.
- Tactile or visual muscle twitch assessment is practical but subjective and less accurate compared to objective methods like EMG, AMG, and MMG.

### Patterns
#### Single-Twitch Stimulation
- A single supramaximal electric current is applied at a frequency ranging from 1.0 Hz (one per second) to 0.1 Hz (one every 10 seconds).

#### Train-of-Four (TOF)
- Four stimuli at 2 Hz are applied (four in 2 seconds), repeated every 10-12 seconds if needed.
- The ratio of the fourth response to the first response (T4/T1 ratio) assesses neuromuscular blockade.
- In the absence of blockade, the ratio is 1.
- Nondepolarizing blocks decrease the ratio proportionally to the degree of the block, while depolarizing blocks decrease all responses equally, maintaining a TOF ratio of 1.
- A TOF value of 0.70 indicates impaired respiratory muscle function, hypoxia, and aspiration risk postoperatively. Neostigmine is given when the TOF count spontaneously returns to three or four responses. Sugammadex dose is adjusted based on TOF and post-tetanic stimulation responses.

#### Tetanic Stimulation
- A stimulus of 30, 50, 100, or 200 Hz is applied for 5 seconds. Normal neuromuscular transmission and depolarizing blocks sustain the response, while nondepolarizing and phase II depolarizing blocks show a decrease (fade).
- Post-tetanic facilitation occurs when muscle response increases immediately after tetanic stimulation due to acetylcholine mobilization and synthesis.
- Degree of post-tetanic potentiation depends on neuromuscular block extent.
- Tetanic stimulation is painful and only applicable in anesthetized patients.

##### Post-Tetanic Count Stimulation
- Used when TOF and single-twitch responses are absent due to intense neuromuscular block.
- A tetanic stimulation (50 Hz for 5 seconds) is followed by single-twitch stimulation at 1 Hz starting 3 seconds after tetanic stimulation. The first response to post-tetanic twitch stimulation signals the beginning of block dissipation.

#### Double-Burst Stimulation (DBS)
- Consists of two short bursts of 50-Hz tetanic stimulation separated by 750 ms, with each burst's impulse duration being 0.2 ms.
- Commonly used DBS has three impulses in each burst. In nondepolarizing block, the second response is weaker than the first.
- DBS is more sensitive for detecting residual blockade during emergence and postoperative periods. DBS response is more easily felt than TOF.

### Muscles Used for Stimulation
- Common sites: ulnar and facial nerves; other sites include common peroneal and posterior tibial nerves.
- **Ulnar nerve**: Electrodes placed on the volar wrist, response recorded from adductor pollicis.
- **Facial nerve**: Negative electrode placed over the nerve, positive electrode over the forehead, response recorded from orbicularis oris and corrugator supercilii.

### Muscle Response
- The diaphragm is the most resistant to neuromuscular blockade but recovers fastest compared to hand muscles. The most sensitive muscles include abdominals, extremities, and upper airway muscles.
- Facial nerve stimulation mimics laryngeal muscle response but is not a reliable indicator for extubation due to possible residual peripheral muscle block.
- Ulnar nerve response ensures diaphragm and larynx muscle recovery. An absent response during intubation may not ensure appropriate intubating conditions.

### Quantitative Measures
- Tactile and visual responses are subject to human error, especially when TOF ratio > 0.4.
- Quantitative monitoring provides precise neuromuscular blockade assessment during emergence and neostigmine administration.
- Techniques include:
  - **AMG**: Measures isotonic muscle acceleration using a piezoelectric transducer.
  - **PMG**: Measures low-frequency muscle contraction sounds.
  - **MMG**: Measures muscle contraction force.
- These techniques, though quantitative, cannot be reliably compared to each other. Quantitative monitoring ensures TOF > 0.9 and reduces postoperative residual paralysis incidence.

# Anaesthesia Circuits

![](Pasted%20image%2020240630153042.png)

## Anesthesia Circuits

### Introduction
- The primary types of anesthesia circuits include the Mapleson systems (A, D, E, F) and the circle system.
- Mapleson systems are also known as carbon dioxide washout or flow-controlled breathing systems, as they rely on fresh gas flow (FGF) to eliminate carbon dioxide.

### Components
1. Fresh gas flow
2. Breathing tube (corrugated for flexibility and kink resistance)
3. Mask
4. Reservoir bag (antistatic or low-charged, monitors respiration, accommodates FGF during expiration, protects from excessive pressure)
5. Connectors (increase dead space and resistance)
6. Adaptors
7. Adjustable pressure-limiting (APL) valve (also known as pop-off valve, exhaust valve, overspill valve, pressure relief valve, scavenger valve, or expiratory valve)

### Mapleson A

#### Advantages
- Optimal for spontaneous respiration with minimal FGF waste.
- APL valve opens during spontaneous respiration, requiring FGF equal to minute ventilation (75–100 ml/kg/min) for maximal efficiency.
- Excess FGF forces alveolar gas to vent through the APL valve.

#### Disadvantages
- Not suitable for controlled ventilation.
- Carbon dioxide monitoring is necessary during controlled ventilation.
- Increased FGF waste.
- Poor scavenging as the APL valve is near the patient.
- Higher operating room/atmospheric pollution.

### Mapleson D
- During spontaneous breathing, with the APL valve open, the patient inhales mostly FGF from the anesthesia machine, and alveolar gases are vented at the APL valve during exhalation.
- For controlled ventilation, the APL valve is partially closed, FGF is set at 1.5–2 times minute ventilation, and alveolar gases are vented during inspiration.
- The major disadvantage is higher FGF required to avoid rebreathing, making it less efficient and causing more pollution than the Mapleson A system.

### Mapleson E
- With an open end, it is the most difficult system for scavenging gases.
- FGF depends on the patient's respiratory rate and minute volume, and the capacity of the expiratory limb.
- If the capacity equals tidal volume, an FGF rate of 2.5 times minute volume is sufficient; otherwise, FGF should be increased.

### Mapleson F (Jackson-Rees)
#### Advantages
- Suitable for neonates.
- Inexpensive.

# CBP

## Components
1. **Venous reservoir**
2. **Membrane oxygenator bundle**
3. **Venous and arterial blood line/cannula**
4. **Arterial filter purge line**
5. **Arterial line filter**
6. **Venous blood pump** (also called the arterial pump head; forces venous blood through the membrane oxygenator and returns arterialized blood to the patient’s aortic root)
7. **Cardiotomy suction pump**
8. **Ventricular vent** (left ventricular vent)
9. **Cardioplegia pump**
10. **Crystalloid cardioplegia**
11. **Water inlet line**
12. **Water outlet line**
13. **Gas inlet line**

## Functions
1. **Oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination**
2. **Circulation of blood**
3. **Systemic cooling and rewarming**
4. **Diversion of blood from the heart to provide a bloodless surgical field**

## Extracorporeal Circulation or Extracorporeal Life Support
- Mechanical cardiopulmonary support.
- In the operating room for cardiac surgery: **Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB)**
- For respiratory support with extrathoracic cannulation: **Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)**
- For renal support: **Hemodialysis**

## Types of Oxygenators
1. **Bubble Oxygenators**
   - Simple, low-cost, greater efficiency, lower priming volumes, easy to assemble.
   - Disadvantages: Production of microemboli, increased blood cell trauma due to turbulence and foaming.
   
2. **Membrane Oxygenators**
   - Gas exchange through a thin membrane, minimal cellular trauma.
   - Disadvantages: Requires greater surface area, larger priming volume, expensive, difficult to clean.

## Filters
1. **Depth Filters**
   - Packed fibers of Dacron, significant thickness, no defined pore size.
   - Filtration depends on the thickness and tightness of the material.
   - Efficient in removing gaseous emboli and microemboli.
   - Disadvantages: Removes many platelets.

2. **Screen Filters**
   - Woven mesh of polyester fibers, defined pore size.
   - Removes fewer platelets, less efficient in removing gaseous emboli and microemboli.

## Partial Bypass
- Partial bypass occurs when only a portion of systemic venous blood drains to the pump oxygenator, while the rest passes through the right heart and lungs to be ejected by the left ventricle.
- Employed in descending thoracic aortic surgery to provide perfusion to distal organs while the aorta is cross-clamped, minimizing the risk of neurologic complications (e.g., paraplegia).

## Left Ventricular (LV) Venting
- LV venting via the cardioplegia cannula in the aortic root prevents distension of the left ventricle and air embolism.
- Prevents mechanical damage to the myocardium, reduces myocardial oxygen demand, facilitates subendocardial perfusion, and prevents pulmonary venous hypertension.

## Types of Flow
1. **Pulsatile Flow**
   - Improves microcirculation quality, prevents systemic inflammatory response.
   - However, only a small amount of pulsatile energy is delivered to the patient’s arterial system.

2. **Nonpulsatile Flow**
   - Commonly used during CPB, simpler to manage.

## Complications
1. Aortic dissection, best diagnosed by TEE or epi-aortic scanning.
2. High arterial line pressure.
3. Massive air embolism and microthrombi causing postoperative confusion and delirium.
4. Oxygenator failure, requiring replacement or separation from CPB.
5. Arterial pump failure (electrical or mechanical), necessitating hand crank use.
6. Clotting of the circuit from inadequate anticoagulation or inadvertent protamine administration.
7. Obstruction of venous return and air lock.
8. Electrical failure, with backup battery or hand cranking as alternatives.
9. Hemolysis from cell trauma, increased with prolonged pump runs.
10. Exsanguination due to tubing disconnection while on bypass.

## Causes of High Pressure on the Arterial End
1. Systemic hypertension in the patient.
2. Occlusion or malposition of the aortic cannula.
3. Dissection of the aortic wall.
4. Inadvertent clamp or kink in the line.
5. Obstructed arterial line filter.

# Line Isolation Monitor

![[image-429-x28-y320.png]]

## Introduction

A line isolation monitor (LIM) works with an isolation transformer to ensure safe electrical power transmission between circuits without direct connection. The main power supply, which is grounded, loops around the primary coil of the isolation transformer. The current in the primary coil generates a magnetic field, inducing an electrical potential difference in the secondary coil. This setup allows current flow from the primary to the secondary coil without direct electrical connection, preventing faults on one side from affecting the other. The isolation transformer transmits only the potential difference, not the absolute voltage. Hence, a fault in a device connected to the isolated power supply does not lead to an electric shock since it is not grounded.

### Leakage Currents
- **Definition:** Leakage currents are unintended currents that may pass from exposed metal parts of equipment to ground or other parts of the instrument, even in perfectly working electrical equipment.

### What is a LIM?
- **Function:** A LIM detects electrical potential and leakage currents between the two lines of the isolated secondary system and ground. It alarms with audible and visual warnings when the system degrades to a level where a 5 mA or greater electric shock could occur with the next fault.
- **Key Points:**
  - An alarm indicates that the system has partially grounded and needs correction but does not imply imminent danger. Ongoing procedures need not be halted.
  - The LIM does not interrupt electrical service; ungrounded systems continue to function.
  - An active alarm suggests that a current of at least 5 mA could flow to ground if a path is provided. A second fault is needed for a hazardous condition to exist. The last device plugged into the system is likely the cause and should be checked.

### Locations Where Used

Electrically isolated systems are required in wet locations such as:

- Intensive Care Units (ICUs)
- Coronary Care Units (CCUs)
- Emergency Departments
- Special Procedure Rooms
- Electrophysiology Laboratories
- Dialysis Locations
- Various other wet locations involved in patient care, such as GI labs

### Effects of Different Current Strengths
- **Human Body as Resistor:** The body resists current flow, which varies with mass and moisture content.
- **Macroshock:**
  - 1 mA: Threshold of perception, slight tingling.
  - 5 mA: Maximum harmless current.
  - 10–20 mA: Muscle contracture may prevent release of an electrode.
  - 50 mA: Pain, fainting, exhaustion.
  - 100 mA: Likely ventricular fibrillation (VF).
- **Microshock:** As little as 100 μA can cause VF.

### Enhanced Risk
- Patients undergoing thoracic surgery or using cardiac catheters and dye injectors are at high risk due to potential direct leakage of current into the circulatory system.
- Highest risk occurs when the heart is exposed to a conducting agent like diagnostic catheters or pacing wires.
- Anesthetized or immobilized patients, or those with restraints or on drug therapy, are more susceptible to electrical hazards because they cannot disconnect themselves during an electric shock.
- Risk factors include electrolyte imbalance, hypoxemia, elevated catecholamine levels, and drugs like digitalis. Infants are also at higher risk due to smaller body mass.

## Difference from Home Electrical System
- **Isolation Transformer:** The isolated circuit has no potential relative to earth, eliminating the risk of electrocution upon contact with the electrical supply.
- **Fault Handling:** If a fault occurs, the system reverts to the usual power supply. A LIM detects potential differences with earth and alarms without cutting off electricity. In contrast, a ground fault circuit interrupter cuts off electricity during a fault, which could be disastrous in an operating theatre or ICU.

## Electrical Equipment Classification
### ISO Classification
1. **Earthed Equipment:** 3-pin power supply, conductive case.
2. **Non-Earthed Equipment:** 2-pin plug, non-conductive outer case.
3. **Not Earthed Equipment:** Usually battery-operated, safe extra low voltage (<25V AC or <60V DC).

### Type Designation (Protection from Electrocution)
- **B:** Leakage current < 100 μA. Risk of microshock, should not connect to the heart.
- **BF:** Leakage current < 100 μA. Uses isolation transformer, no direct connection to mains.
- **CF:** Leakage current < 10 μA. Uses isolation transformer, providing the safest equipment.
# HME Filter

## Properties Required
### Efficiency and Testing

- **Saline Test:** Must be tested using the saline test according to ISO 9360-1:2000.
- **Efficiency:** Must have 99.97% efficiency at 30 L/min.

### Pressure Limit

- **P Limit:** 60 cmH₂O (or 20 cmH₂O above the breathing circuit).

### Minimum Humidity

- **Ventilated <10h:** Minimum humidity of 20 g/m³.
- **ICU Ventilated >10h:** Minimum humidity of 33 g/m³.

### Dead Space and Filter Type

- **Dead Space:** Should be appropriate for tidal volume (TV) if low flows.
- **Filter Type:** Should be a hydrophobic, pleated filter (not electrostatic) to ensure viruses, bacteria, and liquids do not pass through.

### Pediatric Considerations

- **Lower Weight Limits:**
	- HME: 5 kg
	- Just Filter: 3 kg
## Disadvantages
- Bacterial infections (bacterial filter can be added) = HMEF
- Less effective in hot temperatures
- Less effective at high TV
- Dead space
- Resistance
- 50-80% efficacy
- Clogging with vomit or secretions
- Not reusable
