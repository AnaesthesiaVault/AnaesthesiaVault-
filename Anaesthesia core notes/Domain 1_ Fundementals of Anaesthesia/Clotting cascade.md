# Clotting Cascade

## Interplay between Coagulation, Anticoagulation, and Fibrinolysis

### Coagulation Pathways

1. **Extrinsic Tenase Complex:**
   - TF (Tissue Factor)
   - VIIa (Activated Factor VII)
   - Leads to activation of **X (Factor X)** to **Xa (Activated Factor X)**
2. **Intrinsic Tenase Complex:**
   - IXa (Activated Factor IX)
   - VIIIa (Activated Factor VIII)
   - Converts **X (Factor X)** to **Xa (Activated Factor X)**
3. **Prothrombinase Complex:**
   - Xa (Activated Factor X)
   - Va (Activated Factor V)
   - Converts **II (Prothrombin)** to **IIa (Thrombin)**
4. **Thrombin (IIa):**
   - Converts **Fibrinogen (FGN)** to **Fibrin**
   - Activates **XIII to XIIIa**, facilitating cross-linking of fibrin.
### Anticoagulation Mechanisms

1. **Antithrombin III (ATIII):**
   - Inhibits thrombin (IIa) and factor Xa.
2. **Protein C (PC) and Protein S (PS):**
   - Inhibits factors Va and VIIIa when activated by Thrombin-Thrombomodulin (TM) complex.
3. **TFPI (Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor):**
   - Inhibits TF/VIIa complex and factor Xa.
### Fibrinolysis

1. **Plasminogen:**
   - Activated to **Plasmin** by **tPA (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)** and **uPA (Urokinase)**
   - Degrades fibrin into fibrin degradation products (FDPs) and D-dimers.
2. **TAFI (Thrombin Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor):**
   - Inhibits fibrinolysis by removing lysine residues from fibrin.
## Primary Hemostasis: Normal Physiology, Disorders, and Clinical Findings

**Normal Physiology:**
1. **Injury to Blood Vessels:**
   - Exposes collagen and microfibrils, leading to platelet adhesion.
2. **Platelet Adhesion:**
   - vWF binds to collagen and interacts with glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) on platelets.
3. **Platelet Activation:**
   - Mediated by agonists (ADP, thrombin, collagen).
   - Platelets change shape and release granule contents.
4. **Platelet Aggregation:**
   - Fibrinogen binds to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa on activated platelets, forming platelet plug.
### Platelet Function

**Platelet Activation:**
- **Thromboxane A2 (TXA2):**
  - Cyclooxygenase system releases arachidonic acid, forming TXA2.
  - TXA2, a potent vasoconstrictor, activates platelets via TP receptor, initiating phospholipase C pathway, forming DAG and IP3, increasing cytoplasmic calcium, activating protein kinase C, and promoting degranulation.
- **Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP):**
  - ADP binds to P2Y12 (Gi coupled, inhibiting adenylate cyclase, reducing cAMP, releasing calcium) and P2Y1 receptors (Gq coupled, activating phospholipase C, causing degranulation).
- **Thrombin:**
  - Binds to PAR-1 and PAR-4 on platelets, activating PLC pathway, leading to further platelet activation and degranulation.

**Activated Platelet:**
- Releases α-granules, dense granules, and lysosomal enzymes.
- Phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins changes platelet shape, aiding aggregation.
- Forms a scaffold for the coagulation cascade, leading to a 'thrombin burst' converting fibrinogen to fibrin.

**Platelet Aggregation:**
- Shape change in response to ADP, thrombin, or TXA2 activation.
- Activation and surface expression of GP IIb/IIIa receptor, with fibrinogen bridging platelets.
- Aggregated platelets crucial for clot retraction and stabilization.

**Monitoring Platelet Function:**
- **Bleeding Time:** Not practical.
- **Optical Light Transmission Platelet Aggregometry:** Gold standard, lab-based, time-consuming.
- **TEG:** Monitors GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, not sensitive for thienopyridines or salicylates.
- **Modified TEG:** Sensitive for thienopyridine and salicylates.

## Cell Based Model of Coagulation

#### Initiation
- **Process:** Tissue Factor (TF) exposure activates Factor VII to form the **extrinsic tenase complex (TF/VIIa)**.
- **Action:** This complex activates Factor X, which in turn activates a small amount of prothrombin (Factor II) to thrombin (Factor IIa).
#### Amplification
- **Process:** The small amount of thrombin produced in the initiation phase activates Factors V, VIII, IX, XI, and von Willebrand factor (vWF).
- **Action:** These activations lead to platelet activation.
#### Propagation
- **Process:** Activated platelets play a crucial role in activating Factors XII, XI, and IX.
- **Action:** Activated Factor VIII (from the amplification phase) combines with activated Factor IX to form the **intrinsic tenase complex (VIIIa/IXa)**.
- **Effect:** This complex is a powerful activator of Factor X. Activated Factor X (Xa) combines with activated Factor V (Va) to form the **prothrombinase complex (Xa/Va)**, which catalyzes prothrombin activation by 300,000-fold.
#### Clot Formation
- **Process:** Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin.
- **Action:** Factor XIIIa consolidates the fibrin into a stable fibrin clot.
### Summary

- **Initiation:**
	- Formation of the extrinsic tenase complex activates Factors IX and X, leading to a small amount of thrombin production.
- **Amplification:**
	- Thrombin activates Factors VIII, V and IX.
- **Propagation:**
	- Factor VIII and IX form the intrinsic tenase complex, which generates large amounts of Factor X.
	- Factor X combines with Factor V to form the prothrombinase complex.
## Classic Pathway

![](Pasted%20image%2020240220133040.png)

#### Amplification
- **Process:** Thrombin plays a central role in the amplification of the coagulation cascade.
- **Action:** Thrombin activates multiple factors:
  - Factor V
  - Factor VII
  - Factor VIII
  - Factor XI
  - Factor XIII
#### Negative Feedback
- **Process:** Thrombin also mediates negative feedback mechanisms to regulate coagulation.
- **Actions:**
  1. **Antithrombin Activation:**
	 - Thrombin activates antithrombin, which inhibits Factor X and thrombin itself.
  2. **Thrombomodulin Complex Formation:**
	 - Thrombin forms an inactive complex with endothelial thrombomodulin.
	 - This complex activates Protein C, which works with Protein S to inactivate Factor Va and Factor VIIIa.
### Summary

- **Amplification:** Thrombin activates Factors V, VII, VIII, XI, and XIII to enhance the coagulation cascade.
- **Negative Feedback:**
  - Thrombin activates antithrombin to inhibit Factor X and thrombin.
  - Thrombin forms a complex with thrombomodulin, which activates Protein C. Activated Protein C, with Protein S, inactivates Factors Va and VIIIa.
## Conditions Affecting Clotting
### Acidosis / Coagulopathy / Hypothermia (The Trauma Triad)
**i) The Lethal Triad** Hypothermia inhibits platelet function and coagulation, and activates fibrinolysis. Acidosis accelerates fibrinogen consumption without influencing fibrinogen production. In addition, patients lose clotting factors through bleeding and undergo haemodilution during resuscitation.
### Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPS)
**DAMPS:** Histones trigger DIC, activate platelets, inhibit Protein C (by binding to Thrombomodulin). Inflammatory cytokines induce TF.
### Vasopressin

vWF secretagogue → enhances platelet function → haemostatic

## Fibrinolysis

![](Pasted%20image%2020240627165557.png)

- **Thrombin has the following negative feedback effects:**
	a) Activates Antithrombin III which inhibits both Factor Xa as well as Thrombin itself  
	b) Combines with Thrombomodulin to form the thrombin-thrombomodulin-complex which activates Protein C → which inhibits factor Va and VIIIa
- **Inhibitors of fibrinolysis**: tPA inhibitor 1 & 2; α₂-antiplasmin
- **Effects of fibrin degradation products:** Anti-thrombin effects, interfere with platelet activity
### Fibrinolysis Pathway

1. **Plasminogen Activation:**
	- **tPA (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)** and **Urokinase** convert plasminogen to plasmin.
2. **Plasmin Action:**
	- Degrades fibrin into fibrin degradation products.
	- Inhibited by **α2-antiplasmin** and **α2-macroglobulin**.
3. **Thrombin-Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI):**
	- Inhibits fibrinolysis.

# Termination of Clotting
- Limits the clot to the area of injury.
- Naturally occurring anticoagulants:
- Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) = inactivates TF/VIIa complex and Xa
- Protein C & S = destroys factor 5 & 8
- Anti-thrombin III = inhibits thrombin (IIa) and X
- C1 inhibitors = inhibit factor 7 & 11
- Factor Z = Degrades Xa
