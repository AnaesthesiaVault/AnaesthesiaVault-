# Neuromuscular Disorders

Neuromuscular disorders are a heterogeneous group of diseases affecting skeletal muscle via abnormalities of the motor nerves, neuromuscular junction, cellular matrix, ion channels, and metabolic derangements.

## Basic Principles

## Pre-Operative Assessment

### Organ Systems

#### Respiratory
- Dysmorphic features suggesting a difficult airway
- Obstructive sleep apnoea
- Restrictive lung disease from scoliosis
- Respiratory insufficiency secondary to respiratory and pharyngeal muscle involvement

#### Cardiovascular
- Autonomic dysfunction
- Cardiomyopathy
- Conduction abnormalities due to abnormal conducting tissue or metabolic derangements

#### Metabolic
- Na, K, Mg, Cl, Ca may be deranged
- Sustained muscle contraction may cause rhabdomyolysis; a pre-operative baseline urine myoglobin is useful to ascertain postoperatively if there has been any increase.

### Investigations
- Arterial blood gases, pulmonary function tests, chest X-ray, ECG, and echocardiogram are all extremely helpful in this population.

### Premedication
- Many commonly used premedicating drugs should be used with caution in patients with NMD.
- Anxiolytic agents can be advantageous in those patients in whom crying and fear can precipitate muscle spasm due to the release of catecholamines.
- If administered, agents causing central respiratory depression or reduced respiratory muscle tone should be given at a reduced dose with close, continuous monitoring.

## Pre-Operative Management
- Aim for a stress-free anaesthetic. Increased neuromuscular and catecholamine activity can trigger myotonic reactions and decompensate a dysfunctional cardiorespiratory system.
- **Monitoring:** Oxygen saturation, NIBP, ECG, capnography, minute ventilation, peripheral nerve stimulator, and temperature monitoring are all mandatory. Invasive blood pressure monitoring is invaluable in those with an element of autonomic dysfunction.
- **Regional Techniques:** After thorough neurological assessment, regional anaesthesia may be invaluable in this patient population in whom respiratory depression with opiates is disadvantageous.

## Drugs

### Neuromuscular Blocking Drugs
- The effect of neuromuscular blocking agents depends on the disease process, but suxamethonium should be avoided in all NMD except myasthenia gravis, where the dose may need to be doubled.
- The use of non-depolarising muscle relaxants can often be avoided by judicious use of intravenous induction agents. However, if required, it should be given in reduced doses (10-20%) due to increased sensitivity. Atracurium is a popular choice due to its spontaneous Hoffman degradation, but the key to muscular blockade is careful titration and close monitoring with a peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS). Neuromuscular block should be checked with a PNS before administration of any muscle relaxants.

## Considerations
- **Macroglossia (Duchenne's):** Difficult airway
- **Kyphoscoliosis:** Restrictive lung disease
- **Respiratory Muscle Weakness:** Recurrent lung infections, post-op ventilation (check for bulbar weakness/OSA)
- **Cardiac Dysfunction:** Cardiomyopathy (tachycardia/dysrhythmia). Assess: Cardiac MRI/dobutamine stress test echo. Optimize: ACEI. Intraoperative invasive monitoring, meticulous fluid monitoring (hypovolemia = cardiac arrest) + inotropes ready. Intra-op: titrate anesthetic agents slowly! Avoid falling behind with fluid.
- **Increased Bleeding Risk (Duchenne's):** Tranexamic acid & blood products ready.
- **Risk of AIR:** Trigger-free anaesthetic & "clean" ventilator. Some have intellectual disability. Risk of hypothermia. Autonomic dysfunction.

## Complications

### Rhabdomyolysis
- Depolarising muscle relaxants can lead to rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia in almost all neuromuscular diseases, especially in denervated, dystrophic, and metabolically altered muscle. Extrajunctional or foetal isoforms of the acetylcholine receptor lead to widespread membrane depolarisation, hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, and potentially cardiac arrest. Sustained release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum can also cause hypermetabolism and muscle cell damage and this may be potentiated by volatile anaesthetic agents.

### Respiratory Complications
- Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in patients with NMD. Complications are related to:
  - Involvement of bulbar muscles causing repeated aspiration and chronic insufficiency
  - Respiratory and pharyngeal muscle involvement
  - Higher incidence of OSA in affected children
  - Progressive spinal deformities causing restrictive defects
- Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases may be very useful preoperatively to assess the level of dysfunction. Administration of respiratory depressants in the perioperative period can lead to acute decompensation, and respiratory insufficiency in recovery is not uncommon. Premature extubation must be avoided, especially in those with a difficult airway secondary to anatomical abnormalities. Intensive care may be required postoperatively to allow time for respiratory depressants to be eliminated.

### Cardiac Complications
- Cardiomyopathy and cardiac conduction abnormalities are common in many neuromuscular disorders, with death secondary to cardiac arrest being the second most common cause of death in this patient group.

### Autonomic Dysfunction
- Autonomic dysfunction is not uncommon in NMD and can be responsible for severe hypotension on induction or after regional anaesthesia. Gastric stasis may also present as aspiration if not anticipated.

### Myotonic Reactions
- Myotonic contraction is caused by repetitive action potentials leading to a permanent sodium influx or reduced chloride efflux across the muscle membrane, rendering the membrane hyperexcitable. Myotonic reactions can be caused by:
  - Suxamethonium
  - Anticholinesterases
  - Opioids
  - Alterations in temperature
  - Acidosis
  - Shivering
  - Change in osmolality
- Preventative measures for myotonias may include maintaining a serum potassium of 4.0-4.5 mmol/l and a diet generous in complex carbohydrates to lessen stiffness. In hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, thiazides, acetazolamide, and sodium restriction may be therapeutic. In the event of a myotonic reaction, the precipitant should be sought and corrected. Drugs that cause a use-dependent block of sodium channels (class one antiarrhythmics) are the treatment of choice.

### Malignant Hyperthermia
- Some suggest that just three myopathies; Evans myopathy, King Denborough syndrome, and Central Core Disease are predisposed to MH, while others believe all myopathies are at increased risk. Irrespective of the pathophysiology of the muscle injury, close monitoring as described earlier is recommended in all patients with NMD and prompt treatment of electrolyte disturbances, acidosis, hyperthermia, and myoglobinuria is essential. Dantrolene has been used for hypermetabolism not associated with MH to good effect.

## Post-Operative Care
- Extubation should not occur until the patient is able to maintain adequate tidal volumes and airway reflexes have returned, as respiratory failure and aspiration are common.
- Hypoxia, hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, electrolyte disturbance, and hypothermia can all have catastrophic consequences in the post-operative period and should be monitored closely. A urine dip for myoglobin or serum CK may be sent to assess the level of muscle injury.

## Anaesthetic Considerations Summary

### Drugs and Myopathies

Many drugs are associated with myopathies:

- Statins
- Vincristine
- Cyclosporine
- Gold
- Chloroquine
- colchicine
- Labetalol
- Nifedipine
- Cocaine
- Zidovudine
- *NB! Beware of the combination of high dose corticosteroids (particularly fluorinated compounds such as dexamethasone) and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants–this can cause an acute, quadraparetic myopathy.*
# Specific Diseases Overview

## Motor Neurone Disease

Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a degenerative impairment of the motor neurones. It is most commonly sporadic, but can also be hereditary or infectious in origin. MND can affect the lower motor neurones, upper motor neurones, or both, leading to denervation of the skeletal muscle resulting in spasticity or atrophy depending on the location of the abnormality.

**Anaesthetic Considerations:**
- **Respiratory Insufficiency:** Poor cough and bulbar dysfunction leading to aspiration.
- **Hyperkalaemia Risk:** Over-expression of the extra-junctional or foetal acetylcholine receptor can occur over the surface of skeletal muscle, resulting in life-threatening hyperkalaemia if suxamethonium is used.
- **Sensitivity to Non-Depolarising Muscle Relaxants:** Increased sensitivity may be noted.
- **Spasticity Control:** Baclofen, diazepam, and dantrolene can be used perioperatively.
  - Baclofen should not be withdrawn abruptly as it may precipitate a malignant hyperthermia-like crisis.

## Peripheral Neuropathies

Peripheral neuropathies are an extremely diverse group of neuromuscular disorders associated with conditions such as diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disorders (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome), critical illness, toxic substances, infections, and hereditary disease.

**Anaesthetic Considerations:**
- **Cardiac and Autonomic Dysfunction:** Cardiovascular lability may be augmented by cardiodepressant anaesthetic agents. A higher degree of atrioventricular blocks may require temporary pacemaker insertion perioperatively.
- **Preoperative Documentation:** Meticulous documentation of preoperative disability and discussion with the patient is mandatory if a regional technique is used.

## Disorders of Neuromuscular Transmission

Disorders of neuromuscular transmission include conditions such as Myasthenia Gravis, Eaton-Lambert Syndrome, and Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome.

**Anaesthetic Considerations:**
- **Myasthenia Gravis:** May require increased doses of muscle relaxants, careful monitoring of respiratory function, and avoidance of depolarising agents.
- **Eaton-Lambert Syndrome:** Sensitivity to both depolarising and non-depolarising agents, with potential autonomic dysfunction.

## Muscular Dystrophies

Muscular dystrophies are a group of progressive genetically determined degenerative myopathies, the most commonly known being Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD).

### Myotonic Disorders

There are three syndromes: Myotonic Dystrophy, Myotonia Congenita, and Paramyotonia Congenita. Myotonic Dystrophy is the most common and is characterised by incomplete muscle relaxation (myotonia).

**Extramuscular Features:**
- Cardiomyopathy
- Conduction abnormalities
- Restrictive lung disease
- Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)
- Delayed gastric emptying
- Dysphagia
- Hypothyroidism
- Diabetes mellitus

### Muscular Dystrophies

**Pathophysiology:**
- **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD):** Absence of dystrophin gene, leading to progressive deterioration of muscle.
- **Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD):** Abnormal dystrophin gene.

**Anaesthetic Considerations:**
- **Functional Assessment:** Essential as respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms correlate poorly with muscle symptoms.
- **Cardiac Involvement:** Intra-atrial conduction abnormalities; cardiomyopathy by age 14 in DMD.
- **Respiratory Insufficiency:** Due to respiratory muscle weakness, sensitivity to respiratory depressant drugs.
- **Risk of Hyperkalaemia and Rhabdomyolysis:** Over-expression of extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors; avoid suxamethonium and anticholinesterases.
- **Smooth Muscle and Platelet Dysfunction:** May cause increased blood loss.
- **Hypovolaemia:** Poorly tolerated due to stiff myocardium; invasive monitoring may be necessary.
- **Female Carriers:** Mild myopathic changes and cardiomyopathy; treat with caution.

## Metabolic and Mitochondrial Myopathies

### Pathophysiology

The pathophysiologies behind metabolic and mitochondrial myopathies are manifold. Muscle metabolism should be supported by the administration of substrates depending on the disorder (e.g., glucose, amino acids).

**Anaesthetic Considerations:**
- **Metabolic Monitoring:** Aggressive monitoring in the perioperative period is essential.
- **Acid Maltase Deficiencies:** Can cause respiratory insufficiency, aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, macroglossia, cardiomegaly, and hepatomegaly.
- **Lipid Storage Myopathies:** Susceptible to hypoglycaemia, acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiac failure.
- **Mitochondrial Myopathies:** Most anaesthetic drugs have a depressant effect on mitochondria and should be used with care. Tight glycaemic control is necessary to avoid lactic acidosis.
  - Suxamethonium should be avoided; atracurium appears safe at low doses.
  - Risk of third-degree heart block; consider preoperative pacemaker implantation.

## Non-Dystrophic Myotonias and Periodic Paralyses

Non-dystrophic myotonias and periodic paralyses are characterized by muscle hyperexcitability and episodic muscle weakness.

**Anaesthetic Considerations:**
- **Depolarising Muscle Relaxants:** Contraindicated due to risk of triggering muscle contractures.
- **Induction:** Both inhalational and intravenous induction with thiopentone are acceptable, followed by non-depolarising neuromuscular agents.
- **Reversal Agents:** Avoid acetylcholinesterases due to the danger of triggering muscle contractures.

### Background
- MS is a heterogeneous disorder with variable clinical and pathologic features. Inflammation, demyelination, and denervation are the major pathologic mechanisms causing the clinical manifestations. The cause is unknown, but the most widely accepted theory is of an inflammatory immune-mediated disorder.

### Considerations
- **Multisystem Effects of Demyelination**:
  - Aspiration risk (bulbar dysfunction)
  - Respiratory failure/insufficiency (central hypoventilation and neuromuscular weakness)
  - Autonomic dysfunction with possible hemodynamic instability
- **Altered Response to Neuromuscular Blocking Drugs (NMBs)**:
  - Succinylcholine contraindicated due to hyperkalemia risk (denervation, misuse myopathy)
  - Sensitivity to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (NdMRs), but can also exhibit resistance
- **Potential Perioperative Exacerbation of Disease**:
  - Neuraxial technique (spinal > epidural) is controversial; some sources suggest regional/neuraxial is acceptable
  - Avoid hyperthermia
- **Immunosuppressive Medications**:
  - Steroids, interferon, methotrexate

### Goals
- **Minimize Aspiration Risk**: Consider prophylaxis, rapid sequence induction (RSI)
- **Maximize Respiratory Function**: Avoid paralysis, ensure full NMB reversal, manage secretions, and pain
- **Maintain Hemodynamic Stability**
- **Prevent Postoperative Exacerbations**: Avoid triggers (hyperthermia, stress, +/- neuraxial)
- **Patient Communication**: Inform patient of potential perioperative aggravation of symptoms

### Conflicts
- **Neuraxial Technique vs. Disease Exacerbation**:
  - Spinal traditionally considered contraindicated, but controversial
  - Low-dose epidural most likely safe; have discussion with the patient
  - Peripheral nerve block is safe as those nerves are not involved
- **RSI vs. Hemodynamic Stability**
- **RSI vs. Avoid Succinylcholine**

### Pregnancy Considerations
- Neuraxial (both epidural and spinal) is NOT contraindicated
- Discuss risk with the patient regarding potential postoperative/post-delivery relapse, regardless of anesthetic technique

Ensure thorough documentation, preoperative discussions with patients, and careful monitoring throughout the perioperative period to mitigate risks and manage symptoms effectively.

## Guillain-Barre

### Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240312124158.png)

### Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS): Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

**Triggers**:
- Minor: surgery, trauma, bone marrow transplant
- Major: GI/respiratory infection (1-3 weeks prior) - Campylobacter jejuni, cytomegalovirus, HIV, Epstein-Barr Virus

**Pathogenesis**:
- **Immune Response**:
  - Initiation of immune response (unknown mechanism)
  - Molecular mimicry: shared ganglioside antigens between peripheral nerve and pathogen coat proteins
  - Increased permeability of blood-nerve barrier at the level of proximal nerve roots
- **Antibody Attack**:
  - IgG antibodies to ganglioside antibodies in serum
  - Demyelination: antibodies attack Schwann cells
  - Axonal damage: antibodies attack nodes of Ranvier
  - Increased protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)

**Clinical Features**:
- **Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP)**:
  - 80-90% of cases
  - Demyelination: decreased conduction velocity, conduction block
  - Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)
  - Acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN)

**Symptoms**:
- **Sensory Deficits**:
  - Pain and paresthesia (in back and extremities)
- **Motor Deficits**:
  - Limb weakness (legs usually affected first)
  - Universal areflexia (loss of deep tendon reflexes)
- **Autonomic Dysfunction**:
  - Dysautonomia: disruption of the autonomic nervous system responsible for involuntary functions
  - BP fluctuation/orthostatic hypotension: drop of blood pressure from seated/lying to standing
  - Tachycardia and dysrhythmias (needs cardiac monitoring)
  - Sudden death
- **Other Features**:
  - Urinary retention (transient, late-course)
  - Phrenic nerve involvement: diaphragm paralysis
  - Cranial nerve (CN) involvement
  - Bulbar palsy (CN IX, X, XI, XII)
  - Eye movement abnormalities (Miller Fisher Syndrome - rare form of regionally-restricted AIDP)

### Definition
- **Acute**:
  - Monophasic
  - Rapidly progressing (2 weeks)
  - Symmetrical
  - Immune-mediated
  - Polyneuropathy
  - Caused by preceding illness
- **Resulting in**:
  - Weakness and paralysis (requiring intubation and ventilation in 30%)
  - Autonomic dysfunction (70%)
  - Pain

### Background
- Acute inflammatory demyelinating peripheral polyneuropathy usually secondary to immunologic response to viral or bacterial infection
- Ascending progressive muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and areflexia
- Respiratory compromise:
  - 25% will require mechanical ventilation
  - Forced vital capacity < 20 mL/kg, maximum inspiratory pressure < 30 cmH2O, or maximum expiratory pressure < 40 cmH2O → high risk of impending respiratory failure, urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation

### Considerations
- **Aspiration Risk**: Due to bulbar dysfunction
- **Perioperative Respiratory Insufficiency**: Due to muscle weakness (anticipate need for postoperative ventilation)
- **Autonomic Dysfunction**: Possible hemodynamic instability and autonomic hyperreflexia-type reactions
  - Arrhythmias, cardiac arrest
  - Physical stimulation can precipitate hypertension and tachycardia
- **Altered Response to Neuromuscular Blocking Drugs (NMBs)**:
  - Succinylcholine contraindicated due to hyperkalemia risk
  - Sensitivity to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants (NdMR)
- **Increased Risk of Venous Thromboembolism**
- **Neuropathic Pain**: Common (40-50%)
- **Treatment**: Includes IVIG and plasma exchange; steroids NOT recommended

### Goals
- **Minimize Aspiration Risk**: Consider prophylaxis, rapid sequence induction (RSI)
- **Maximize Respiratory Function**: Avoid NMBs or use reduced dose of NdMR with full reversal, manage secretions, and provide pain management
- **Maintain Hemodynamic Stability**

### Conflicts
- **RSI**: Versus avoiding succinylcholine, maintaining hemodynamic stability
- **Neurologic Deficits and Regional Techniques**

### Pregnancy Considerations
- Controversy regarding neuraxial but probably safe; document pre-existing deficits
- If general anesthetic is chosen: avoid succinylcholine and use minimal NdMR

### Summary

GBS is an acute, monophasic, rapidly progressing, immune-mediated polyneuropathy typically triggered by preceding illness, characterized by weakness or paralysis and autonomic dysfunction. Respiratory muscle weakness often necessitates mechanical ventilation in about 30% of cases, and autonomic dysfunction is present in 70%. It is crucial to anticipate and manage perioperative complications, including respiratory failure, aspiration risk, and hemodynamic instability, while considering altered responses to neuromuscular blocking drugs and increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Treatment typically involves IVIG and plasma exchange, with careful monitoring and management to optimize patient outcomes.

  2. **Non-Depolarizing Muscle Relaxants (NDMRs)**: Effects may be prolonged.
  3. **Maintenance**: Use intravenous (IV) or volatile anesthetics.
  4. **Post-Operative Ventilation**: May be needed due to respiratory compromise.
  5. **Neurological Deficits**: Carefully document before considering neuraxial techniques.

**Goals**:
- Minimize risk of hyperkalemia by avoiding succinylcholine.
- Adjust dosing of NDMRs to account for potential prolonged effects.
- Ensure smooth induction and maintenance with IV or volatile agents.
- Be prepared for potential post-operative respiratory support.
- Thoroughly assess and document neurological deficits pre-operatively to guide neuraxial anesthesia decisions.

### Summary

Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease is a hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by progressive muscular weakness and sensory loss. Diagnosis involves decreased nerve velocity and sural nerve biopsy. Treatment focuses on supportive care, physiotherapy, and surgical interventions to manage symptoms. Anaesthetic management requires careful avoidance of certain drugs and readiness for post-operative ventilation due to the risk of respiratory compromise. Thorough pre-operative assessment is essential to ensure safe anesthetic care.

### Myotonic Dystrophy: Background and Clinical Considerations

**Background**:
- Myotonic Dystrophy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder with two major forms: Type 1 (DM1) and Type 2 (DM2).
- It is a multisystem disorder characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and myotonia, cardiac conduction abnormalities, cataracts, testicular failure, hypogammaglobulinemia, and insulin resistance.

#### Considerations

**Multisystem Disease**:

- **Airway**:
  - Bulbar dysfunction & risk of aspiration
  - Central sleep apnea
- **Respiratory**:
  - Restrictive lung disease (weak respiratory muscles)
  - Possible pulmonary hypertension
  - Decreased ventilatory response to hypoxia/hypercarbia
- **Cardiac**:
  - Cardiomyopathy
  - Dysrhythmias & heart blocks
- **GI**:
  - Delayed gastric motility
- **Endocrine**:
  - Hypothyroid
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - Adrenal insufficiency

**Altered Sensitivity to Anesthetic Agents**:
- **Succinylcholine**: Contraindicated due to risks of hyperkalemia & myotonic contractures
- **CNS Depressants**: Increased sensitivity (e.g., propofol, opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates)
- **Cholinesterase Inhibitors**: May trigger myotonic contracture, avoid neostigmine

**Risk of Perioperative Myotonic Crisis**:
- **Triggers**:
  - Drugs (e.g., succinylcholine, neostigmine)
  - Surgical manipulation, electrocautery, nerve stimulator
  - Hypothermia/shivering
- **Treatment**:
  - Phenytoin, procainamide, quinine, IM lidocaine, increased volatile anesthetic
	- Phenytoin/procainamide: 18 mg/kg over 20 min
	- Quinine 300-600 mg IV
  - Muscle relaxants & IV anesthetics do NOT work

### Goals/Optimization
- **Multidisciplinary Discussion**: In elective cases, discuss plans for surgery with a multidisciplinary team.
- **Aspiration Prevention**: Administer aspiration prophylaxis.
- **Hemodynamic Stability**: Avoid hemodynamic instability.
- **Prevent Myotonic Crisis**: Avoid precipitants and be prepared to treat if required.
- **Post-Operative Monitoring**: Arrange appropriate disposition, consider need for post-operative monitoring and ventilation.

### Conflicts
- **Aspiration Prevention (RSI)**: Need to prevent aspiration vs. contraindication to succinylcholine and high-dose rocuronium (reversal with neostigmine contraindicated).

### Pregnancy
- **High-Risk Pregnancy**:
  - Increased muscle weakness/myotonia, heart failure, uterine atony, postpartum hemorrhage
- **Neuraxial Anesthesia**: Preferred for labor and vaginal or cesarean delivery.

### Summary

Myotonic Dystrophy is a multisystem disorder with significant anesthetic implications. Key considerations include avoiding succinylcholine and cholinesterase inhibitors, managing the risk of perioperative myotonic crisis, and ensuring thorough preoperative planning and monitoring. Special attention is required for airway management, respiratory function, and cardiovascular stability. In pregnancy, neuraxial anesthesia is preferred due to the high risk of complications. Multidisciplinary coordination is essential for optimizing patient outcomes.

### Duchenne

### Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD): Pathophysiology and Clinical Features

#### Pathophysiology
- **Genetics**: X-linked recessive condition
- **Mechanism**:
  - Lack of Dystrophin, a protein that stabilizes the muscle cell membrane, protecting the sarcolemma from contraction-induced stress.
  - Absence of Dystrophin leads to membrane tears, muscle damage, and increased membrane permeability.
  - Increased intracellular Ca²⁺ due to increased release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or increased Ca²⁺ permeability.
  - Repeated cycles of muscle damage and regeneration in the early phase lead to upregulation of fetal and adult ACh receptors, similar to chronic denervation.
  - Use of succinylcholine or volatile anesthetics can cause sustained muscle contraction and a surge in intracellular Ca²⁺, resulting in the release of myoglobin, CK, and K⁺, leading to hyperkalemic arrest.
  - In the later phase, regenerative capacity of muscle is exhausted, and tissue is gradually replaced by adipose and connective tissue.

#### Clinical Features

**Characteristics**:
- Shoulders and arms held back awkwardly when walking
- Swayback with weak butt muscles (hip straighteners)
- Knees may bend back to take weight
- Thick lower leg muscles (mostly fat, not strong)
- Tight heel cord (contracture), child may walk on toes
- Belly sticks out due to weak belly muscles (poor at sit-ups)
- Thin, weak thighs (especially front part)
- Poor balance, frequent falls
- Awkward and clumsy gait
- Weak muscles in front of leg cause 'foot drop' and tiptoe contractures

**Progression**:
- **First Decade**:
  - Rapid replacement of muscle mass with fatty infiltration, leading to pseudohypertrophied calf muscles.
- **Second Decade**:
  - Muscle breakdown decreases as viable muscle becomes exhausted.
  - Onset of cardiac involvement:
	- Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMO) present in 100% by age 18, often undiagnosed due to a sedentary lifestyle.
	- ECG abnormalities: Q-waves in lateral leads, ST-segment elevation, poor R-wave progression, resting tachycardia, and conduction defects.
	- Typical lesion on ECHO: subepicardial fibrosis in the inferolateral wall.
  - Proximal muscle weakness leading to Gower's sign.
  - Progressive decrease in muscle strength, mobility, and increase in contractures and obesity.
  - Progressive truncal motor weakness resulting in scoliosis (60-90%).
  - Respiratory complications due to restrictive lung disease, progressively decreasing FVC.

#### Anaesthesia Considerations
1. **Trigger-Free Anesthesia**:
   - Avoid succinylcholine (risk of hyperkalemic arrest).
   - Use a clean, volatile-free machine (flush for 10 minutes at ≥ 10 L/min for older machines, 100 minutes for newer ones; replace soda lime and circuit).
2. **Careful Use of Opioids**: Increased sensitivity.
3. **Careful Use of Non-Depolarizing Muscle Relaxants (NDMRs)**: Increased sensitivity due to decreased muscle mass or extrajunctional receptors.
4. **Increased Risk of Blood Loss**: Due to platelet dysfunction; consider antifibrinolytics in high bleeding risk procedures such as scoliosis surgery.

### Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) and Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD)

#### Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD)
- **Presentation**: Milder form of DMD, predominantly affecting males in the second decade.
- **Pathophysiology**: Decreased dystrophin levels lead to slower progression of muscle weakness.
- **Cardiac Involvement**: Rare before age 16.

#### Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD)
- **Presentation**: Progressive proximal muscle weakness starting around age 10.
- **Pathophysiology**: Due to defective production of essential proteins.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Distinguished by cardiac conduction defects that can lead to syncope and may require pacemaker implantation.
  - Cardiomyopathy is not common.

### Summary

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) are X-linked recessive disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness due to the lack or deficiency of dystrophin. DMD presents early with severe progression, while BMD has a milder course. Anesthesia management requires avoiding triggers for hyperkalemic arrest, careful use of opioids and muscle relaxants, and consideration of respiratory and cardiac complications. Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy involves muscle weakness and cardiac conduction defects, often requiring pacemaker intervention.

## Metabolic and Mitochondrial Myopathies

### General Anesthetic Approach
1. **Assess Cardio-Respiratory Involvement**: Thorough preoperative evaluation.
2. **Machine Preparation**: Purge all volatile agents.
3. **Establish Risk of MH/AIR**: Most myopathies require avoiding volatiles. Use Propofol except for mitochondrial myopathies where volatiles are preferred.
4. **Avoid Succinylcholine**: Contraindicated due to resultant hyperkalemia.
5. **Non-Depolarizing Muscle Relaxants (NDMRs)**: Increased sensitivity and duration of action (DOA) necessitate reduced dose and strict monitoring of twitches. Use sugammadex for reversal if needed, as neostigmine may have paradoxical reactions.
6. **Opioids**: Increased sensitivity due to upregulation of endorphin receptors. Minimize use, prefer regional techniques, and monitor postoperatively.

**Safe Anesthetic Options**:
- Propofol (except mitochondrial myopathies)
- Ketamine
- Dexmedetomidine
- Etomidate
- N₂O
- Local and regional techniques

### Mitochondrial Myopathies
1. **Pathophysiology**:
   - Defect in mitochondrial metabolism (substrate transport, utilization, Krebs cycle, electron transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation).
   - Genetic basis: 83% of proteins involved are derived from nuclear DNA, and 13% from mitochondrial DNA, which has a high rate of spontaneous mutations and is maternally inherited.

2. **Clinical Groups**:
   - **Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia**
   - **MELAS**: Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes.
   - **Myopathy Resembling Muscular Dystrophy**: Includes cardiomyopathy and myoclonic seizures. Ragged red fibers are seen on muscle biopsy. Common symptoms include easy fatigue and poor stamina.

3. **Anesthetic Considerations**:
   - **Avoid Propofol**: Risk of Propofol Infusion Syndrome (Prise).
   - **Avoid Succinylcholine**: Risk of rhabdomyolysis.
   - **Exaggerated Metabolic Response**: To stress (pain, fasting, fever, shivering, hypoxia).
   - **Avoid**: Tourniquets and lactated fluids.
   - **Avoid Respiratory Acidosis**:
	 - Prevent lactic acidosis by avoiding stressors.
	 - Manage pain with neuraxial or regional blocks to avoid respiratory depression.
	 - Premedicate with Clonidine or have parental presence for children.
	 - Use IV glucose-containing fluids preand intraoperatively (2% dextrose, monitor blood sugar regularly).
	 - Maintain normal hemoglobin (transfusion trigger 10 g/dL).
	 - Support ventilation to prevent respiratory acidosis and hypoxia.

### Myotonia Anesthetic Considerations
**Spasms**:
- Myotonia: Sustained myotonic contractions triggered by pain, cold, stress, muscle stimulation, and drugs like Suxamethonium and neostigmine.
- Risk of masseter, intercostal, and diaphragmatic spasm.
- Muscle relaxants do not stop spasms; volatiles may reduce spasms. Treat underlying cause, e.g., temperature control. If resistant, use lignocaine (Sodium channel blocker).

**Weakness**:
- Sensitivity to NDMR: May require postoperative ventilatory support.

**Sensitivity to Opioids and Sedatives**:
- Prefer opioid-sparing approach (use regional techniques where possible).

**Arrhythmias**:
- Keep electrolytes steady to avoid arrhythmias.

**Aspiration Risk**:
- Avoid Suxamethonium.

### Non-Dystrophic Myotonias

**Considerations**:
- Avoid triggers that can cause myotonic crises.
- Use safe anesthetic techniques as mentioned above.
- Thorough preoperative planning and monitoring are essential.

### Myositis
#### Background
- Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies characterized by proximal skeletal muscle weakness and evidence of muscle inflammation.
- Dermatomyositis is associated with characteristic skin manifestations, unlike polymyositis.

#### Considerations
- **Airway**: Potential difficulty due to restricted temporomandibular joint and cervical spine mobility.
- **Aspiration Risk**: Due to esophageal dysfunction.
- **Respiratory**:
  - Interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis.
  - Potential postoperative respiratory muscle failure and need for ventilation.
- **Cardiovascular**:
  - Myocardial fibrosis, myocarditis, conduction defects, and arrhythmias.
- **Altered Response to Succinylcholine and NDMRs**:
  - Avoid Succinylcholine (risk of hyperkalemia), consider reduced dose of rocuronium.

#### Treatment
- Steroids, immunosuppressants, IVIG, monoclonal antibodies.

#### Conflicts
- RSI for aspiration risk vs. difficult intubation.
- RSI for aspiration risk vs. avoid Succinylcholine.
- RSI for aspiration risk vs. cardiac induction.

### Pregnancy Considerations
- Avoid Succinylcholine if RSI for general anesthesia is required.
- Caution with neuraxial techniques if respiratory muscles are already compromised.

### Summary

Management of metabolic and mitochondrial myopathies, myotonia, and myositis involves avoiding specific triggers and drugs that can exacerbate their conditions, careful preoperative assessment, and tailored anesthetic approaches to minimize risks and complications. Multidisciplinary planning and postoperative monitoring are crucial to optimize patient outcomes.
