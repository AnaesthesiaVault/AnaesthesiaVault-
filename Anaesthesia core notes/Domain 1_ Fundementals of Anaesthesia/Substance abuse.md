# Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314171910.png)

## General Perioperative Approach

### 1. Defer Elective Surgery
- **Indication:** Acutely intoxicated patients.
- **Rationale:** Reduces drug interactions, haemodynamic instability, and withdrawal risks.

### 2. Management of Recovering Addicts
- **Considerations:**
  - Different protocols for patients on Methadone vs. Buprenorphine.
  - Opiate antagonists can precipitate withdrawal.
  - Use multimodal analgesia (MMA) or adequately dose opiates if used.
- **Actions:**
  - Involve the multidisciplinary team (MDT) and pain team.
  - Discuss with the patient the risk of relapse if opiates are used.

### 3. Hyperalgesia Management
- **Medication:** Ketamine.
- **Dosage:** 0.06 - 0.12 mg/kg/hr.

### 4. Catecholamine Management
- **Issue:** Potential depletion of catecholamine stores.
- **Approach:**
  - Use direct-acting agents only (Avoid ephedrine).
  - Avoid β-blockers to prevent unopposed α-stimulation.
  - Dexmedetomidine can be used.

### 5. Management of Withdrawal/Delirium Tremens (DTs)
- **Supportive Management:**
  - Sedation
  - Fluids
  - Electrolyte balance
  - Glucose control

### 6. Pulmonary Considerations
- **Potential Complications:**
  - Pulmonary toxicity
  - Pulmonary hypertension (PHT)
- **Cause:** Chronic inhalation or sympathomimetic use.

### 7. Analgesic Options
- **Strategies:**
  - Full multimodal analgesia (MMA)
  - Infusions
  - Regional anesthesia
  - Neuraxial anesthesia

## Considerations

### Anaesthesia for Chronic Alcohol (ETOH) Users

#### Consent
- Assess for intoxication status.

#### Premedication
- **Benzodiazepines:** Prophylactic use to prevent withdrawal symptoms.

#### Coagulation
- **Tests:** Check INR and evaluate for thrombocytopenia.

#### Electrolytes
- **Actions:** Check and correct any imbalances.

#### Blood Sugar
- **Risk:** Chronic alcohol users are prone to hypoglycemia.

#### Aspiration Risk
- Increased risk due to potential delayed gastric emptying.

#### Drugs
- **Withdrawal Protocol:** Ensure adherence to a withdrawal management protocol.
- **Pharmacodynamics/Pharmacokinetics (PD/PK):**
  - Chronic abusers may require increased doses of propofol, thiopentone, and opioids due to possible enzyme induction.
  - Dose requirements decrease during acute intoxication.
  - Hepatic impairment leads to reduced drug clearance.
  - Hypoalbuminaemia can affect drug binding and efficacy.

#### Regional/Blocks
- **Documentation:** Record any existing peripheral neuropathy.
- **Consideration:** Evaluate coagulation status before proceeding.

#### Haemodynamics
- **Consideration:** Be aware of the potential for underlying cardiomyopathy.

#### Complications
- **Withdrawal:** Monitor and manage withdrawal symptoms.
- **Postoperative Risks:**
  - Increased risk (2-5 times) of complications such as acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, prolonged ICU stays, and increased risk of delirium.

### Multisystem Disease

#### Central Nervous System (CNS)
- **Conditions:** Peripheral neuropathy, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (ocular abnormalities, ataxia, confusion), cerebral atrophy/dementia.

#### Cardiovascular System
- **Conditions:** Cardiomyopathy, palpitations, arrhythmias.

#### Gastrointestinal System
- **Conditions:** Liver dysfunction/cirrhosis, esophagitis, gastritis, pancreatitis, malnutrition.

#### Haematology
- **Conditions:** Pancytopenia.

#### Endocrine/Metabolic System
- **Conditions:** Hypoglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia).

#### Musculoskeletal System
- **Conditions:** Myopathies, osteoporosis.

#### Other Considerations
- **Addictions:** Monitor for other substance dependencies.
- **Alcohol Withdrawal Syndromes:** Implement CIWA protocol for management (tremors, autonomic hyperactivity, delirium tremens).

### Altered Pharmacology
- **Liver Enzyme Induction:** May increase the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of anesthetics.

## Alcohol Withdrawal & Syndromes

### Earliest & Most Common Symptoms
- **General Symptoms:** Generalized tremors, perceptual disturbances (nightmares, hallucinations), autonomic hyperactivity (tachycardia, hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias), nausea, vomiting, insomnia, mild confusion, and agitation.
- **Onset:** Symptoms usually begin within 6 to 8 hours after a substantial decrease in blood alcohol concentration and peak at 24 to 36 hours.
- **Management:** Symptoms can be suppressed by resumption of alcohol ingestion or administration of benzodiazepines.

#### Delirium Tremens
- **Incidence:** Occurs in approximately 5% of those experiencing withdrawal.
- **Symptoms:** Hallucinations, combativeness, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension or hypotension, grand mal seizures.
- **Onset:** Symptoms begin 2 to 4 days after alcohol cessation.
- **Treatment:**
  - **First Line:** Benzodiazepines titrated to effect without loss of respiration.
  - **Additional Treatments:** Beta blockers to reduce tachycardia and hypertension, correction of metabolic abnormalities (potassium, magnesium, thiamine).
  - **Severe Cases:** ICU admission, propofol infusion/dexmedetomidine, and possible intubation.
  - **Mortality Rate:** Approximately 10%, usually due to hypotension, dysrhythmias, or seizures.

#### Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome

##### Wernicke's Encephalopathy
- **Pathology:** Loss of neurons in the cerebellum.
- **Nature:** Acute syndrome requiring emergent treatment to prevent death and neurologic morbidity.

##### Korsakoff's Psychosis
- **Nature:** Chronic neurologic condition.
- **Cause:** Loss of memory resulting from the lack of thiamine (vitamin B1), which is required for the intermediary metabolism of carbohydrates.
