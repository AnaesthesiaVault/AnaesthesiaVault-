# Introduction
- **All patients should be assessed for risk of PONV**
- **General principles:**
	- Risk reduction
	- Prophylaxis
	- Treatment
- **Multimodal PONV management strategy should take into account:**
	- Patient’s choice
	- Cost-effectiveness 
	- Preexisting conditions (risk of prolonged QT, Parkinson’s, closed-angle glaucoma, etc)
- **PONV management is an important part of Enhanced Recovery Pathways**

# Physiology of Vomiting
### Physiology of Vomiting

Vomiting is integrated by the vomiting centre, located in the dorsal part of the lateral reticular formation in the medulla oblongata. This centre predominantly contains acetylcholine (ACh) receptors and some histamine (H1) receptors. It receives inputs from the cerebral cortex, chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS).

The cerebral cortex receives afferent CNS input from pathways mediating pain, smell, sight, emotion (fear/anxiety), and organic disturbances.

#### Chemoreceptor Trigger Zone (CTZ)

The CTZ is located outside the blood-brain barrier on the floor of the fourth ventricle in the area postrema. It contains serotonin (5HT3) and dopamine receptors and receives input from the vestibular apparatus, which contains H1 and ACh receptors. The NTS contains 5HT3 receptors and receives input from gastrointestinal tract stretch and chemoreceptors.

#### Efferent Pathways

The efferent pathways are carried by the vagus, hypoglossal, glossopharyngeal, trigeminal, and facial nerves to the stomach and via the spinal nerves to the diaphragm and abdominal muscles.

### Phases of Vomiting

Vomiting has two phases:

1. **Pre-ejection phase**
	- Sympathetic nervous system causes tachycardia, tachypnoea, and sweating.
	- Parasympathetic system causes salivation, upper and lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation, and retrograde contraction, preparing the body for the ejection phase.
	- Experienced as nausea in older children.
2. **Ejection phase**
	- Begins with cessation of respiration in mid-inspiration.
	- Hyoid and larynx elevate, glottis closes, soft palate elevates to close off nasopharynx.
	- Diaphragm contraction increases intra-abdominal pressure.
	- Gastro-oesophageal sphincter opens and gastric contents are ejected.

### Triggers, Receptors, and Vomiting Center

**Triggers:**

- Memory, fear, taste, sight, smell, pain
- Hypotension, hypoxia, raised ICP
- Drugs (opioids, anaesthetics, chemotherapy)
- Surgery, toxins, gastroparesis
- Motion sickness, middle ear surgery

**Receptors:**

- CTZ: Muscarinic, histaminic, dopamine, opioid, NK-1 receptors
- NTS: 5HT3, ACh receptors

**Vomiting Center:**

- Located in the medulla
- Involves pathways from CTZ, higher cortical centers, and peripheral receptors via cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X

# Paediatric Population
- The incidence of POV varies significantly with the patient population studied, and we (in SA) lack robust data on our patient population. A risk assessment should be conducted for every child, and a rational approach to anti-emetic prophylaxis applied. The POVOC score has been proposed, but this scoring system is not comprehensive, and has not been validated in our patient population.
## Risk Factors for Postoperative Vomiting (POV) in Children
**POVAC SCORE**
1. Length of surgery: > 30 minutes
2. Strabismus surgery
3. Previous history of PONV (or 1st degree family member)
4. History of motion sickness

**Patient Factors:**

- Age > 3 years
- Female (post-puberty)
- History of POV or direct family history
- History of motion sickness

**Surgical Factors:**

- Duration of surgery > 30 mins
- Strabismus surgery
- Adenotonsillectomy
- Middle ear surgery

**Anaesthetic Factors:**

- Volatile anaesthesia
- Opiate use
- Anticholinesterase use

## Anti-emetic Prophylaxis Strategy

**Number of Risk Factors:**

- **2:** Dexamethasone IV 0.15 mg/kg
- **3:** Dexamethasone IV 0.15 mg/kg + Ondansetron IV 0.15 mg/kg*
- **>3:** Dexamethasone IV 0.15 mg/kg + Ondansetron IV 0.15 mg/kg +/- Droperidol IV 25 mcg/kg, Intra-operative fluid administration up to 30ml/kg

*Timing of Ondansetron administration has not been found to be significant.

**Other Strategies:**

- Avoidance of nitrous oxide
- Multi-modal analgesic strategy to reduce opiate requirements
- Consideration of Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA) technique

## Pediatric POV/PONV Management Algorithm

1. **Risk Factors:**
	
	- Preoperative: Age ≥ 3 years, history of POV/PONV/motion sickness, family history, post-pubertal female
	- Intraoperative: Strabismus surgery, adenotonsillectomy, otoplasty, surgery ≥ 30 mins, volatile anaesthetics, anticholinergics
	- Postoperative: Long-acting opioids
2. **Risk Stratification:**
	
	- No risk factors: Low risk
	- 1-2 risk factors: Medium risk
	- ≥ 3 risk factors: High risk
3. **Prophylaxis:**
	
	- Low risk: None or 5HT3 antagonist or dexamethasone
	- Medium risk: 5HT3 antagonist + dexamethasone
	- High risk: 5HT3 antagonist + dexamethasone + consider TIVA
4. **Rescue Treatment:**
	
	- Use anti-emetic from a different class than prophylactic drug - droperidol, promethazine, dimenhydrinate, metoclopramide; may consider acupuncture/acupressure.
### Risk-Adapted PONV-Prevention Algorithm (With No Prevention in Low-Risk Patients)

**Estimated risk for PONV, for example, as determined by a risk score:**

||Low|Medium|High|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Interventions for Prophylaxis**|No prevention ("wait and see")|Drug A + Drug B or TIVA|Drug A + Drug B + TIVA|
|**Interventions for Treatment**|1. Drug B|1. Drug C|1. Drug C|
||2. Drug C (in case of ineffectiveness of treatment in stage 1, i.e., Drug B)|2. Drug D (in case of ineffectiveness of treatment in stage 1, i.e., Drug C)|2. Drug D (in case of ineffectiveness of treatment in stage 1, i.e., Drug C)|

- **Drug A** = Dexamethasone
- **Drug B** = Ondansetron
- **Drug C** = Droperidol (15-25 mcg/kg in children)
- **Drug D** = Dimenhydrinate (0.5 mg/kg children)
# Adults
## Consensus Guidelines for Managing Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)

### Patient-Specific Risk Factors

- Female sex
- Non-smoking status
- History of PONV or motion sickness

### Anaesthetic Risk Factors

- Use of volatile anaesthetics within 0 to 2 hours
- Nitrous oxide
- Use of intraand postoperative opioids

### Surgical Risk Factors

- Duration of surgery (each 30-minute increase in duration increases PONV risk by 60%)
- Type of surgery (laparoscopy, ear-nose-throat, neurosurgery, breast, strabismus, laparotomy, plastic surgery)

## Strategies to Prevent PONV

### Decrease Baseline Risk

- **Calculated risk using the Apfel simplified risk score for adults or the POVOC score for children.**

### Interventions

- Avoid general anaesthesia and use loco-regional anaesthesia instead. If general anaesthesia is required, TIVA with propofol reduces the incidence of PONV by 30%, making this intervention as effective as an antiemetic drug.
- Limiting the perioperative administration of opioids decreases not only the risk of PONV but also the overall need for antiemetic interventions.

### Combine Effective Antiemetics

- Using a combination of effective antiemetics tailored to the patient's risk profile can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of PONV. This may include 5HT3 antagonists, corticosteroids, and other antiemetic classes.
## Management

### Prevention

1. **Total Intravenous Anaesthesia/Avoidance of Volatile Anaesthetics**
   - Volatile anesthetics are significant triggers for early-onset PONV (within 6 hours after surgery).

2. **Avoiding Nitrous Oxide (N2O)**
   - While previously assumed to increase PONV risk, nitrous oxide does not necessarily do so in a clinically relevant manner. However, its prolonged use is likely relevant.
   - Current guidelines recommend avoiding nitrous oxide in surgeries lasting over 1 hour.

3. **Adequate Hydration**
   - Administering crystalloids at a rate of 10–30 ml/kg/h, compared to 0–10 ml/kg/h, reduces the PONV rate in both adults and children.

4. **Multimodal Analgesia Including Regional Anaesthesia**
   - The opioid-sparing effects of non-opioids and regional anaesthesia contribute to a decreased risk of PONV.

5. **Avoiding Neostigmine**

### Prophylaxis

- **Timely Application of Antiemetics**
  - Glucocorticoids should be administered as early as possible to ensure effectiveness by the end of the operation.
  - Faster and shorter-acting substances, such as ondansetron or droperidol, should be administered just before emergence/end of surgery.
- **Drug Classes**
  - Administration should include a combination of different antiemetic classes, tailored to the patient’s specific risk factors and surgical context.

## Adult PONV Management Algorithm

1. **Risk Factors:**
	
	- Female sex, younger age, non-smoker, surgery type, history of PONV/motion sickness, opioid analgesia
2. **Risk Mitigation:**
	
	- Minimize use of nitrous oxide, volatile anesthetics, high-dose neostigmine
	- Consider regional anesthesia
	- Opioid sparing/multimodal analgesia
3. **Risk Stratification:**
	
	- Quantify the number of risk factors to determine risk and guide anti-emetic therapy
4. **Prophylaxis:**
	
	- 5HT3 receptor antagonists, antihistamines, corticosteroids, dopamine antagonists, NK-1 receptor antagonists, propofol anesthesia, acupuncture, anticholinergics
5. **Rescue Treatment:**
	
	- Use anti-emetic from a different class than prophylactic drug

| Droperidol    | 5-HT3-antagonist (Ondansetron, Granisetron, Palonosetron, Tropisetron)             |

- In approximately 20–30% of patients, PONV occurs even if prophylaxis has been given. Several factors explain the occurrence of PONV despite previous prophylaxis have been applied
## Rescue
- The most important requirements for PONV rescue therapy
	- Parenteral administration
	- Fast onset of action
	- An alternative receptor pathway than previously administered substances
- According to the PONV guidelines, however, a second dose of the same substance can be given after 6 h if no other rescue treatment is available
- dopamine-antagonist: amisulpride for PONV treatment. only approved by FDA

# 2020 Guidelines

## 1. Identifying Patients at Risk

### Apfel Simplified Risk Score for PONV
- **Risk Factors:**
  - Female Sex
  - History of PONV or Motion Sickness
  - Non-smoker
  - Use of Postoperative Opioids
- **Number of Apfel risk factors & risk of PONV:**
  - 0 = 10%
  - 1 = 20%
  - 2 = 40%
  - 3 = 60%
  - 4 = 80%

### Other Known Risk Factors
- Younger age (<50 years)
- General anesthesia
- Use of volatile anesthetics and nitrous oxide
- Duration of anesthesia
- Type of surgery (cholecystectomy, laparoscopic, gynecological)

### Risk Categories Based on Number of Risk Factors
- Low: 0-1
- Medium: 2-3
- High: 4 or more

## 2. Reducing Baseline Risk
- Avoid general anesthesia by using regional anesthesia
- Avoid volatile anesthetics
- Avoid nitrous oxide in surgeries >1 hour
- Use propofol to induce & maintain anesthesia
- Minimize intraand post-op opioids (regional techniques, multimodal analgesia, α2-agonists)
- Adequate hydration
- Sugammadex instead of neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular block

## 3. Prophylaxis

### Number of Agents to Give
- Low: No prophylaxis
- 1-2 risk factors: Give 2 medications
- 2 risk factors: Give 3 or more medications

### Suggested Combination Therapy
- Never combine drugs from the same class
- Most widely studied combinations are 5-HT3 receptor antagonists or butryphenones + dexamethasone. For example, if giving 2 IV drugs:
  - Ondansetron 4mg + dexamethasone 4mg
  - Droperidol 0.625 mg + dexamethasone 4mg
  - Haldol 1 mg + dexamethasone 4mg

### Drugs

#### 5-HT3 Receptor Antagonists

1. **Specific Drugs**
   - Ondansetron: Gold standard
	 - 4 mg IV at the end of case
	 - NNT = 6 for prevention of vomiting & 7 for prevention of nausea
   - Granisetron
	 - 0.35-3 mg (5-20 mcg/kg) IV
	 - As effective as ondansetron
   - Palonosetron
	 - 0.075 mg IV
	 - Effective for 24 hours & superior to ondansetron 4mg IV for PONV prevention
   - Ramosetron
	 - 0.3 mg IV
	 - Similar effectiveness to ondansetron

2. **When to Administer**
   - Ondansetron & Granisetron: Most effective when given at end of surgery
   - Palonosetron: Usually given at the start of surgery

3. **Adverse Events**
   - Ondansetron NNH:
	 - Constipation (NNH = 23)
	 - Increased liver enzymes (NNH = 31)
	 - Headache (NNH = 36)
	 - Increased QTc: Rare, especially for 4mg Ondansetron IV dose

#### Corticosteroids
- **Dexamethasone**
  - Prophylactic dose for PONV = 4-8 mg IV
  - Other benefits when used in higher doses of 0.1 mg/kg or 8 mg IV in adults:
	- Better analgesia
	- Reduced sore throat & muscle pain
	- Reduced difficulty falling asleep
- **Methylprednisolone**
  - 40mg IV effective

#### Antidopaminergics
- **Amisulpride**
  - Dopamine D2, D3 receptor antagonist
  - 5 mg IV for treatment of PONV
- **Droperidol**
  - 0.625 mg IV at the end of surgery
  - Efficacy similar to ondansetron for PONV prophylaxis
  - NNT = 5 for both nausea & vomiting prevention
  - QTc prolongation issues:
	- FDA "black box" restriction 2001; however, doses used for PONV prophylaxis unlikely to increase QTc. Studies show equal QTc effects to Ondansetron
- **Haloperidol**
  - 0.5-<2mg IV or IM at the end of surgery
  - With these low doses, sedation does not occur & cardiac arrhythmias are unlikely
  - QTc prolongation is possible with Haldol, but studies have not shown higher risk than Ondansetron
  - Extrapyramidal side effects are rare with one study suggesting 1/806 patients or 0.1%
- **Perphenazine**
  - 5 mg IV
  - No increase in sedation or drowsiness
- **Metoclopramide**
  - Conflicting evidence due to prior meta-analysis including fabricated evidence
  - 10 mg IV for PONV prevention
  - NNT 8-10
  - Dyskinesia or extrapyramidal symptoms reported at 0.4% (10 mg) and 0.8% (25-50 mg)
  - Consider if other dopamine antagonists not available

#### NK-1 Receptor Antagonists
- **Aprepitant**
  - 40-80 mg PO within 3 hours of induction of anesthesia
  - Routine use not yet established
  - Appears to be more effective than ondansetron in preventing PONV in the first 24-48 hours

#### Antihistamines
- **Dimenhydrinate**
  - 1 mg/kg IV (max 50 mg) is recommended dose
  - NNT 8 (early postop period) and 5 (late postop period)
  - Antiemetic effect may be similar to ondansetron but insufficient studies for optimal timing or dose
- **Promethazine**
  - 6.25 mg IV or deep IM injection
  - FDA Black box warning 2009: risk of severe tissue damage/gangrene if arterial injection or injected under the skin (interstitial IV)

#### Anticholinergics
- **Scopolamine**
  - Transdermal patch (onset is 2-4 hrs)
  - NNT 6
  - Apply presurgery or night before
  - Side effects include visual disturbances (NNH = 5.6), dry mouth (NNH = 13), & dizziness (NNH = 50)

#### Others
- **Propofol**
  - Intraoperative subhypnotic doses at 20 mcg/kg/min or higher can reduce PONV by up to 25%
  - Small doses (20 mg PRN) can be used as PONV rescue therapy in PACU
- **Gabapentin**
  - Preoperative gabapentin 600-800 mg decreases PONV
  - Side effects: sedation, dizziness, respiratory depression, headache
- **Midazolam**
  - 2 mg IV 30 min prior to end of case as effective as ondansetron 4 mg. Combination of the 2 drugs was even more effective
- **Ephedrine**
  - 0.5 mg/kg IM given near end of surgery
  - Similar effect to droperidol 0.04 mg/kg IM
  - Caution if risk of CAD

## 4. Treating PONV

- **Treatment Options:**
  - Use same drugs described previously
  - If prophylaxis was used, use a drug from another class to treat PONV
  - Repeating the medication given for PONV prophylaxis within the first 6 hours after the initial dose conferred no additional benefit
  - If NO prophylaxis was given, start with a low dose 5-HT3 antagonist (e.g. Ondansetron 1 mg)
  - The 5-HT3 antagonists are the only drugs that have been adequately studied for the treatment of existing PONV
- **Alternative Treatments for Established PONV Include:**
  - Dexamethasone, 2 to 4 mg IV
  - Droperidol, 0.625 mg IV, or promethazine 6.25 mg IV
  - Propofol, 20 mg as needed, can be considered for rescue therapy in patients still in the PACU & is as effective as ondansetron

## 5. Non-Pharmacological

- **P6 Acupuncture Stimulation:**
  - Efficacy = prophylactic antiemetics such as ondansetron, droperidol, metoclopramide
  - Timing of trans-cutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation does not impact PONV, with similar reductions being achieved with stimulation initiated before or after induction of anesthesia
  - Neuromuscular stimulation over the median nerve also reduces the incidence of PONV in the early postoperative period, particularly when tetanic stimulation is used
  - Stimulation of L14 and ST36 acupoints may also be effective
- **Adequate IV Hydration:**
  - 10-30 ml/kg effective to reduce risk of PONV
  - No difference between crystalloid vs colloids
- **Carbohydrate Loading:**
  - Inconsistent results but overall no impact on PONV
- **Aromatherapy:**
  - Reduced need for rescue antiemetics

 (low evidence) but not incidence or severity of nausea

  - Isopropyl alcohol somewhat effective; peppermint not effective
- **Chewing Gum:**
  - Early evidence that might be helpful

## 6. Paediatric Considerations

- **Pediatric PONV Risk Factors:**
  - **Preoperative:**
	- Age ≥3 years
	- History of PONV/motion sickness
	- Family history of PONV
	- Post-pubertal female

- **Agents to Give Based on Risk:**
  - Low: None or 5-HT3 antagonist or dexamethasone
  - Medium: 5-HT3 antagonist & dexamethasone
  - High: 5-HT3 antagonist & dexamethasone & consider TIVA
- **Treatment of PONV in Pediatrics:**
  - Use anti-emetic from different class than prophylactic drug
