# Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)

## General Overview
### Definition
- The movement of solutes down their concentration gradient across a semipermeable membrane.
- Gradient maintained by running dialysate countercurrent to the blood flow.
- Rate of blood & dialysate flow
- Duration of dialysis
- Concentration gradient across membrane
- Surface area
- Pore size

### Aims
- **Solute and Water Removal:** Correction of electrolyte abnormalities and normalization of acid–base disturbances.
- **Mechanisms:** Achieved via diffusion (haemodialysis) or convection (haemofiltration).

### Types of RRT
- **Peritoneal Dialysis**
- **Intermittent Haemodialysis (IHD)**
- **Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT)**
  - Continuous Veno-Venous Haemofiltration (CVVH)
  - Continuous Veno-Venous Haemodialysis (CVVHD)
  - Continuous Veno-Venous Haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF)
- **Hybrid Therapies:** Combination of IHD and CRRT, such as Slow Low-Efficiency Daily Dialysis (SLEDD)
- **Slow Continuous Ultrafiltration (SCUF):** Controls fluid balance, particularly in patients with diuretic-unresponsive cardiorenal syndrome.

## System Components
- **Extracorporeal Circuit:** Filled by blood from a wide-bore double-lumen central venous catheter.
- **Roller Pumps:** Control the blood flow speed towards a semi-permeable polysulphone membrane with multiple hollow fibres and pores. The pore size determines which substances can pass through, allowing waste solutes to be removed while retaining cells and blood proteins.
  - **Molecular Clearance:** Middle molecules are preferentially cleared by convective methods, while smaller molecules are more reliably cleared by diffusion.
- **Blood Return:** Blood that passes through the membrane is returned to the patient via the same venous catheter.
- **Anticoagulation:** Required to minimize thrombosis within the extracorporeal circuit.

### Circuit Components
- **Central Double-Lumen Veno-Venous Catheter:** Essential for vascular access.
- **Extracorporeal Circuit and Haemofilter:** Facilitate blood filtration.
- **Blood Pump and Effluent Pump:** Manage blood and waste fluid.

#### Additional Components for CRRT Types
- **CVVH:** Solutes and plasma water are removed via high ultrafiltration rates (convection) across a semipermeable membrane, with replacement fluid infused using a replacement pump.
- **CVVHD:** Solutes and plasma move across the semipermeable membrane into the dialysate compartment by diffusion.
- **CVVHDF:** Solutes and plasma water are removed by diffusion, convection, and ultrafiltration.

## Haemofiltration
- **Mechanism:** A convective process using a hydrostatic pressure gradient to filter plasma, water, and solute across a membrane (similar to the renal corpuscle). The underlying mechanism is ‘solute drag’, where molecules are pulled along with the mass movement of solvent (ultrafiltration).
- **Transport:** Independent of solute concentration but determined by the transmembrane pressure (TMP). Higher flow rates increase ultrafiltration and solute clearance.
- **Effluent:** Discarded fluid produced, with patient circulating volume replaced by a balanced crystalloid buffer solution.

### Transport Mechanisms Across a Semipermeable Membrane
- **Convection (A):** Solutes are transported with plasma water due to a hydrostatic pressure gradient.
- **Diffusion (B):** Solutes move across the membrane driven by a concentration gradient between blood and dialysate.
- **Dialysate Fluid:** Pumped counter-currently through the haemofilter, aiding solute removal by diffusion.
- **Effluent:** Waste dialysate produced.

## Haemodialysis
- **Mechanism:** Solute clearance by diffusion across a membrane. Dialysate, pumped in a counter-current fashion to blood flow, is reconstituted with a buffer (acetic acid or bicarbonate) and essential electrolytes in ultrapure water.
- **Purpose:** Maintain a waste-solute concentration gradient (lower on dialysate side), similar to the Loop of Henle in the kidney.
- **CVVHDF:** Hybrid function requiring replacement and dialysate fluids with the same solution.

## Components of the System

### RRT Membrane
- **Types:** Cellulose-based or synthetic.
- **Biocompatibility:** The interaction between blood and the membrane. Less biocompatible membranes increase harmful side effects. Synthetic membranes are preferred for better patient outcomes.

### Filter Fluid
- **Bicarbonate Replacement:** Necessary during haemofiltration as bicarbonate ions are freely filtered and need replacement.
- **Buffer Solutions:** Bicarbonate-based solutions are preferred over lactate-based in critical illness to avoid lactic acid accumulation.
- **Pre-dilution vs. Post-dilution Replacement:** Pre-dilution reduces filter clotting but decreases solute clearance. Post-dilution is ideal but may compromise filter lifespan.

## Mode of RRT
- **Continuous vs. Intermittent Techniques:** Controversial, with no clear survival benefit.
  - **Advantages of Continuous Techniques:** Enhanced haemodynamic stability, better fluid balance management, enhanced clearance of inflammatory mediators, and better cerebral perfusion in specific conditions.
  - **Evidence:** KDIGO favours CRRT for haemodynamically unstable patients. CRRT initiation may reduce long-term dialysis dependence compared to IHD.
  - **Decision Making:** Based on patient condition and unit capabilities.

### Pros and Cons of CVVHD
- **Pros:**
  - Better haemodynamic control.
  - Continuous operation leads to less fluctuation in solute concentrations and acid-base balance.
  - No cerebral oedema.
  - Can remove toxins with a large volume of distribution (e.g., methotrexate).
- **Cons:**
  - Requires large cannula for access.
  - Risk of filter clotting; requires anticoagulation.
  - High cost.
  - Demands significant ICU nurse time.

### Pros and Cons of IHD
- **Pros:**
  - Rapid normalization of electrolytes and volume removal.
  - Less anticoagulant needed due to higher blood flow rate and reduced treatment duration.
- **Cons:**
  - Risk of systemic hypotension.
  - Potential for cerebral oedema and raised intracranial pressure due to rapid solute removal.

### Flow Rates
- **Blood Flow:** 200-300 ml/min.
- **Dialysate Flow:** 500-1000 ml/min.

### SLED
- **Combination of CVVHD and IHD:** Improved haemodynamic stability, high solute clearances, reduced cost, and allows time off the machine for patient activities.

## Timing of RRT
- The initiation of RRT in critically ill patients is subjective and may influence outcomes.
- **Classical Criteria for Initiation:**
	- Fluid overload
	- Hyperkalaemia (potassium > 6.5 mmol/L or rapidly rising)
	- Severe metabolic acidosis
	- Metabolic encephalopathy
	- Pericarditis
	- Coagulopathy
	- Refractory gastrointestinal symptoms
	- Drug toxicity
- These criteria are based on expert opinion rather than evidence from randomized controlled trials.
- **Risks:** RRT involves risks such as complications from cannula insertion, biocompatibility side effects, fluid shifts, and altered drug metabolism. It also increases nursing workload and costs.
- **Spontaneous Recovery:** The potential for spontaneous kidney recovery must be balanced against the benefits of RRT.
- **Evidence:** Some observational studies suggest earlier RRT initiation improves survival, but randomized controlled trial evidence is limited and conflicting.
	- A single-centre study with predominately surgical patients reported benefits from early initiation.
	- A multicentre study with mainly medical patients found no benefit from early treatment.
	- Ongoing multicentre research may clarify the issue for general ICU settings.
- **Definitions and Decisions:** A lack of consensus on AKI definitions complicates studies on timing. Decisions to start RRT should consider other organ failures and the patient's illness trajectory.
- **Additional Uses:** RRT can manage fluid overload, hyperthermia, and toxicity from acute hepatic failure or drugs.

| Indications  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Renal**    | **Uremia:** Azotemia, neuropathy, myopathy, encephalopathy, pericarditis<br>**Fluid Overload:** Volume removal, pulmonary edema, oliguria with < 200 mL urine output in 12 h<br>**Electrolytes:** Anuria with < 50 mL urine output in 12 h, hyperkalemia (K+ > 6.5 mmol/L), sodium abnormalities<br>**Acid-Base:** Metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.0) |

## Discontinuation of RRT
- **Urine Output:**
	- RRT is continued until evidence of native renal function recovery is observed, primarily indicated by urine output.
	- A urine output > 400 ml/day is a reasonable cut-off for identifying renal recovery from RRT-dependent AKI.
- **Creatinine Clearance:**
	- RRT is discontinued when measured creatinine clearance exceeds 20 ml/min, at the provider's discretion when in the range of 12-20 ml/min.

## Dosing of RRT
- **Continuous Techniques:**
	- Dose is the sum of all effluent fluids expressed as ml/kg/h. Addition of dialysate and targeting of negative fluid balance add to the total dose.
- **Intermittent Techniques:**
	- Dosing is challenging due to urea kinetics and fluid shifts in critically ill patients. Most studies measure dose in terms of frequency and duration of sessions.
- **International Consensus Guidelines:**
	- Recommend a delivery of 20-25 ml/kg/h. Ensuring at least 85% of prescribed treatment time is achieved is crucial to minimize filter downtime.

## Drug Dosing in CRRT
- Modern CRRT treatments result in a creatinine clearance of approximately 25-50 ml/min.

## Vascular Access for RRT
1. Right internal jugular
2. Femoral
3. Left internal jugular
4. Subclavian

## Anticoagulation in CRRT
- **Systemic Heparin:** Most commonly used method.

### Anticoagulation Modalities in CRRT

| Modality             | Advantages              | Disadvantages                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Heparin**          | Good anticoagulation    | Thrombocytopenia, bleeding                           |
| **LMWH**             | Less thrombocytopenia   | Bleeding                                             |
| **Citrate**          | Lowest risk of bleeding | Metabolic alkalosis, hypocalcemia, special dialysate |
| **Regional Heparin** | Reduced bleeding        | Complex management                                   |
| **Saline Flushes**   | No bleeding risk        | Poor efficacy                                        |
| **Prostacyclin**     | Reduced bleeding risk   | Hypotension, poor efficacy                           |

### Alternatives to Heparin
- **If HIT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia) occurs with thrombosis:**
	- Factor 10a inhibitors: Heparinoids (danaparoid) and Fondaparinux
	- Direct thrombin inhibitors (hirudin or argatroban)
- **If HIT antibodies present without thrombosis:**
	- Prostacyclin
	- Citrate
	- Regular saline flushes

## Complications of RRT
### Neurological
- Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome
- Dementia

### Cardiovascular
- Intravascular volume depletion
- Hypotension
- Arrhythmia

### Pulmonary
- Hypoxemia

### Gastrointestinal
- Ascites

### Hematological
- Anemia
- Transient neutropenia
- Residual anticoagulation
- Hypocomplementemia

### Metabolic
- Hypokalemia
- Large protein losses

## General Prescription for RRT
**Anticoagulation:**  
- Unfractionated heparin: 5000 IU bolus followed by a pre-filter infusion at 500 IU/h.
- Aim to anticoagulate filter but ensure APTTR < 2.

**Fluid Balance Over 24 Hours:**  
- Aim for an even balance if the patient is euvolemic.
- Aim for the appropriate negative balance if the patient is fluid overloaded (<1500 ml/24h).

**Type of Replacement Fluid/Dialysate:**  
- Use solutions without potassium if serum potassium is high, but switch to potassium-containing solutions as serum potassium normalizes.
- Use a bicarbonate-based buffer rather than a lactate-based buffer if there are concerns about lactate metabolism or if serum lactate > 8 mmol/L.

**Exchange Rate/Treatment Dose:**  
- 20-25 ml/kg/h.
# Perioperative Considerations for Patients Receiving Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)

### General Considerations

Patients undergoing RRT present unique perioperative challenges due to underlying renal pathology and the effects of dialysis. Proper management requires a comprehensive understanding of these factors to optimize patient outcomes.

### Specific Considerations

- **Calciphylaxis:**
	
	- Vascular calcification of small to medium arteries leading to thrombosis, skin ulcers, necrosis, and gangrene.
- **Cardiovascular Disease:**
	
	- The risk is 10-30 times higher in RRT patients compared to the general population.
- **Pulmonary Hypertension (PHT):**
	
	- Common in patients on long-term dialysis, requiring careful cardiovascular management.
- **Diaphragmatic Splinting:**
	
	- Particularly in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, leading to atelectasis.
- **Arteriovenous Fistula:**
	
	- Maturation occurs after 1-4 months. Avoid cannulation or use of a blood pressure cuff on the limb with a fistula to prevent damage and maintain patency.
- **Activation of Coagulation and Immune Response:**
	
	- Exposure to foreign bodies during dialysis activates the coagulation cascade, complement system, platelets, and leukocytes, increasing the risk of thrombotic and inflammatory complications.
- **Lactate Levels:**
	
	- Lactate may not be a reliable marker of tissue hypoperfusion in RRT patients due to altered metabolism.
- **Anticoagulation:**
	
	- Anticoagulant use during dialysis may influence the timing of surgery. Coordination with the surgical team is essential to minimize bleeding risks.
- **Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome:**
	
	- Monitor for 4-6 hours post-dialysis to avoid surgery during this period. This allows intercompartmental fluid shifts to stabilize, reducing the risk of cerebral edema and other complications.
## Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome (DDS)

**Definition:**

- Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome (DDS) is a rare but serious neurological condition that can occur in patients undergoing dialysis, typically in those who are new to the treatment or who have missed several sessions.

**Etiology:**

- DDS is believed to result from rapid changes in plasma osmolality during dialysis. The rapid removal of urea from the blood leads to a temporary osmotic imbalance between the blood and the brain, causing fluid shifts into the brain and resulting in cerebral edema.

**Risk Factors:**

- New dialysis patients
- High pre-dialysis blood urea nitrogen levels
- Aggressive or high-efficiency dialysis sessions
- Patients with severe metabolic acidosis or advanced uremia

**Clinical Manifestations:**

- Mild symptoms:
	- Nausea
	- Vomiting
	- Headache
	- Restlessness
- Severe symptoms:
	- Seizures
	- Coma
	- Hypertension
	- Confusion
	- Muscle cramps

**Prevention:**

- **Gradual Dialysis Initiation:** Start with shorter, less aggressive dialysis sessions to allow gradual removal of urea.
- **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance.
- **Dialysis Modifications:** Use of lower blood flow rates and dialysate flow rates initially.

**Management:**

- **Supportive Care:** Manage symptoms such as nausea, headache, and muscle cramps.
- **Severe Cases:** Hospitalization may be necessary for close monitoring and management of neurological symptoms.
- **Dialysis Adjustments:** Slow down the rate of dialysis and reduce the efficiency to prevent rapid osmotic shifts.

**Prognosis:**

- With appropriate prevention and management strategies, the prognosis for DDS is generally good. Early recognition and intervention are critical to prevent severe complications.
