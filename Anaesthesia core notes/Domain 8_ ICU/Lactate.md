# Lactate

## Overview
- Lactate is a product of anaerobic glycolysis, reflecting type A (oxygen delivery or increased consumption) or type B (altered metabolism/ reduced utilization) causes.
- 70% of lactate is eliminated by the liver. 20% by renal, 10% by muscle
- Accumulation leads to lactic acidosis.

## Levels
- **Normal range:** 0.6-1.8 mmol/L
- **Hyperlactaemia:** 2 to 5 mmol/L
- **Severe lactic acidosis:** > 5 mmol/L
- High mortality is associated with lactate > 8 mmol/L.

## Physiology

### Daily Production
- Normal production is 20 mmol/kg/day, entering circulation and undergoing hepatic and renal metabolism (Cori cycle).
- All tissues can produce lactate under anaerobic conditions.

### Relationship of Lactate to Pyruvate

Pyruvate + NADH ↔ Lactate + NAD⁺ + H⁺

- Catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase.
- Pyruvate and lactate are in equilibrium.
- Lactic acid has a pK of ~4, so it is fully dissociated into lactate and H⁺ at body pH, making it a ‘strong ion.’

### Pyruvate Metabolism
- **Production:** Pyruvate is produced by glycolysis of glucose, along with NADH.
- **Aerobic conditions:** NADH is oxidized to NAD⁺, allowing glycolysis to continue.
- **Anaerobic conditions:** NADH is oxidized by reducing pyruvate to lactate.

#### Fates of Lactate
1. Re-oxidation to pyruvate if O₂ is restored.
2. Substrate for gluconeogenesis (GNG) forming glucose (Cori Cycle).
3. Fermentation into ethanol + NAD⁺ (not in humans).
4. Oxidation by the liver back into pyruvate.

- **Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex:** Converts pyruvate into Acetyl-CoA for the Krebs cycle using thiamine pyrophosphate as a cofactor.
- **Other:** Pyruvate can also be a substrate for gluconeogenesis.

### Tissues Producing Excess Lactate
- At rest, the tissues producing excess lactate include:
  - Skin: 25%
  - Red cells: 20%
  - Brain: 20%
  - Muscle: 25%
  - Gut: 10%
- During heavy exercise, skeletal muscles contribute most of the increased lactate.
- During pregnancy, the placenta is an important lactate producer.
- In sepsis and ARDS, the lung is a major lactate source.

### Lactate Metabolism and Elimination
- Metabolized predominantly in the liver (60%) and kidneys (30%).
- The heart can use lactate for ATP production.
- 50% is converted into glucose (gluconeogenesis) and 50% into CO₂ and water (citric acid cycle).
- No net acid accumulation requires aerobic metabolism.
- The small amount of lactate that is renally filtered (180 mmol/day) is fully reabsorbed.

## Pathophysiology

### Lactic Acidosis
- Can occur due to excessive tissue lactate production or impaired hepatic metabolism.
- Clinically, a combination of these factors often produces persistent lactic acidosis.

### Causes (Cohen & Woods Classification)

#### Type A–Inadequate Oxygen Delivery
- Anaerobic muscular activity (sprinting, generalized convulsions).
- Tissue hypoperfusion (shock, cardiac arrest, regional hypoperfusion such as mesenteric ischemia).
- Reduced tissue oxygen delivery (hypoxemia, anemia) or utilization (CO poisoning).

#### Type B–No Evidence of Inadequate Tissue Oxygen Delivery
- **B1: Associated with underlying diseases:**
  - Leukaemia, lymphoma, thiamine deficiency, infection, pancreatitis, short bowel syndrome, hepatic, renal, diabetic failures.
- **B2: Associated with drugs & toxins:**
  - Phenformin, cyanide, beta-agonists, methanol, adrenaline, salicylates, nitroprusside infusion, ethanol intoxication, antiretroviral drugs, paracetamol, salbutamol, biguanides, fructose, sorbitol, xylitol, isoniazid, lactate-based dialysate in RRT.
- **B3: Associated with inborn errors of metabolism:**
  - Various enzyme defects (e.g., pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiencies, oxidative phosphorylation enzyme defects).

#### Causes in Sepsis
- Endogenous catecholamine release and adrenaline use.
- Circulatory failure due to hypoxia and hypotension.
- Cytopathic hypoxia–microvascular shunting and mitochondrial failure.
- Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by endotoxin.
- Coexistent liver disease.

### Use of Lactate in Sepsis
- Serum lactate is not a direct measure of tissue perfusion.
- Increases in serum lactate may represent tissue hypoxia, accelerated aerobic glycolysis from excess beta-adrenergic stimulation, or other causes (e.g., liver failure).
- Increased lactate levels are associated with worse outcomes.
- Lactate-guided resuscitation shows significant reduction in mortality compared to resuscitation without lactate monitoring (RR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53–0.84).

## Causes of Hyperlactatemia: Increased Production and Decreased Clearance

### Increased Production

#### Increased Rate of Glycolysis
- **Increased AMP/Imbalance between ATP Supply and Demand:**
  - Hypoxaemia, anaemia, hypoperfusion, shock, CO poisoning, severe exercise (Type A).
- **Catecholamines:**
  - Phaeochromocytoma, salbutamol, epinephrine infusion (Type B2).
- **Unregulated Substrate Entry into Glycolysis:**
  - Fructose infusion (Type B2).

#### Accumulation of Pyruvate
- **Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Inactivity:**
  - Thiamine deficiency, congenital abnormality of pyruvate dehydrogenase, endotoxin inhibition, critical illness (Type B3).
- **Defects of Oxidative Processes:**
  - Malignancy, pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, cyanide toxicity (Type B2).

### Alanine Formation
- **Examples:** Critical illness (Type B2).

### Decreased Clearance

#### Hepatic Metabolism
- **Impaired Oxidative Metabolism:**
  - Impaired liver blood flow, enzyme defects, cyanide toxicity (Type A, B3, B1).
- **Impaired Gluconeogenesis:**
  - Biguanides, alcohol intoxication, diabetes (Type B1, B2, B3).

#### Renal Excretion
- Normally accounts for <5% of lactate clearance, which may rise during hyperlactatemia (Type B1, B2).

## Diagnosis
- Plasma lactate level measurement.
- Identify and treat the underlying cause.
- D-lactate is produced by intestinal bacteria and is not detected on standard lactate assays.

## Collection of Lactate Samples
- Venous samples are equivalent to arterial samples in clinical practice.
- Do not need to remove tourniquet when collecting venous lactate sample unless prolonged search for venous access; if so, remove tourniquet for 20 seconds before sampling.
- Results remain unchanged if left for 15 minutes at room temperature; otherwise, place on ice.
- Repeat lactate measurement if elevated in 4 hours or sooner if condition changes.

## Management

### Steps
1. Diagnose and correct the underlying condition.
2. Restore adequate tissue oxygen delivery.
3. Ensure appropriate compensatory hyperventilation where possible.

### Use of Bicarbonate
- Randomized controlled studies found no beneficial effects of bicarbonate on cardiac function or pH correction in lactic acidosis and shock.
- Alternatives: Carbicarb, dichloroacetate, Tris/THAM.
- Justified in severe pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure to optimize right ventricular function, and severe IHD where lactic acidosis poses an arrhythmogenic risk.
- Adverse effects of sodium bicarbonate: See [sodium bicarbonate use](https://litfl.com/sodium-bicarbonate-use/).

### Dialysis/Haemofiltration
- Peritoneal dialysis is not useful in removing lactate when using bicarbonate-buffered solution.
- Haemofiltration remains a useful marker of clinical disease progression in patients on bicarbonate-buffered haemofiltration.

## Evidence for Lactate Levels and Lactate Clearance
- Lactate levels are proportional to mortality.
- Lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L is associated with poorer outcomes regardless of sepsis (exceptions include salbutamol toxicity, seizure).
- Lactate clearance is non-inferior to ScVO2 monitoring (Jones, JAMA, 2010).
- Poor lactate clearance is prognostically bad in trauma (Abramson, Journal of Trauma, 1998).
- Lactate is the best means to screen for occult severe sepsis.
- EGDT is useful in patients with hyperlactaemia, but titrating treatment to enhance oxygen delivery against lactate concentration is not beneficial (Jansen, Am J Respir Critical Care Med, 2010).

## Other Information

### Lactate Gap
- Lactate gap = lactate (measured by oxidase method)–laboratory lactate (dehydrogenase method).
- Some point-of-care analyzers (e.g., Radiometer 700) cannot distinguish between lactate and glycolate.
- Laboratory analyzers and some point-of-care analyzers (e.g., iSTAT, Bayer) show minimal elevations in lactate in the presence of glycolate.
- Glycolate accumulates in ethylene glycol toxicity.
