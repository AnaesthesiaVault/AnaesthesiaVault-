# Basic Principles of Management

## I. Stabilisation and Meticulous Supportive Care
- **Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)**

## Ii. Decontamination
- **Remove Patient from Toxin**
  - Decontamination is critical when the toxin may continue to be absorbed through contact with the skin (e.g., paraquat, bioterrorism).

## Iii. Limiting Absorption and Increasing Speed of Elimination of the Toxin
- **"Remove the Toxin from the Patient"**

### Reduce Absorption from the Gastrointestinal Tract

Theoretically, the more quickly a poison passes through the gut, the less it is absorbed. Many therapies used to reduce absorption should be commenced within 1 hour of ingestion.

#### Gastric Lavage
- No evidence supports that gastric lavage improves outcomes and it may cause significant morbidity. It should not be used routinely.
- Consider in patients who have ingested life-threatening amounts of a toxin within 1 hour of presentation.

#### Single Dose of Activated Charcoal (SDAC)
- Charcoal is "activated" by treating it with steam and strong acids to create a network of pores, increasing the surface area for toxin adsorption.
- Limited new literature supports its use, although effective if given within 4 hours post-ingestion (most guidelines recommend use within one hour), the benefit falls rapidly over time.
- Indicated in:
  - Poisonings associated with delayed absorption (e.g., tricyclic overdose)
  - Marked enterohepatic circulation (e.g., theophylline)
  - Undifferentiated overdose
- Pulmonary aspiration of charcoal can cause catastrophic pneumonitis; this treatment should not be attempted in patients with a depressed level of consciousness unless the airway is secured.

#### Forced Emesis
- Ipecacuanha syrup contains emetine and cephaeline, which cause vomiting within 30 minutes. It irritates the gastric mucosa and stimulates the central vomiting center.
- Not commonly used.

#### Whole Bowel Irrigation
- Polyethylene glycol electrolyte solutions (1.5-2 L/h) speed transit of poisons through the gut without resulting in significant fluid and electrolyte absorption.
- There is no conclusive evidence that whole-bowel irrigation improves outcomes.
- Occasionally used in pediatrics or severe poisoning with sustained-release preparations, enteric-coated drugs, or body packers.

#### Cathartics
- Cathartics (e.g., magnesium sulphate, sorbitol) have no role today in the management of the poisoned patient.

### Increasing Elimination

#### Multi-Dose Activated Charcoal (MDAC)
- Unlike SDAC, MDAC is used for enhanced elimination by repeated administration (50 g every 2-6 hours).
- Interrupts enterohepatic and enterovascular cycling of poisons.
- Useful for drugs with a small volume of distribution, low pKa, low binding affinity, prolonged elimination half-life, and slow-release preparations.
- Despite significantly increasing drug elimination, it has not been shown to reduce morbidity or mortality.
- Recommended for life-threatening doses of carbamazepine, cardioglycosides, phenobarbitone, quinine, or theophylline.

#### Urinary Alkalinisation
- Enhances the elimination of salicylate and other drugs by ion trapping in urine at elevated pH.
- Requires frequent biochemical monitoring and expertise.
- Aim for a urinary pH of 7.5 - 8.5 by administering 8.4% sodium bicarbonate.
- Aggressively correct hypokalaemia to prevent paradoxical urinary aciduria.
- Increases clearance of salicylates, chlorpropamide, methotrexate, phenobarbitone, and tricyclic antidepressants.

#### Dialysis / Haemoperfusion
- Recommended for severe clinical features and high plasma concentrations of xenobiotics amenable to removal.
- Suitable for toxins with:
  - Low protein binding
  - Small volume of distribution (< 1 L/kg)
  - High water solubility
  - Prolonged elimination half-life
  - Low molecular weight (< 500 Da)
- Haemodialysis is particularly useful for barbiturates, salicylates, theophylline, paraquat, and anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, valproate, phenytoin).
- Charcoal haemoperfusion, using activated charcoal to adsorb toxins, is more useful for drugs with higher protein binding.
- Repeated or prolonged treatment may be necessary due to redistribution from extravascular to intravascular compartments (e.g., lithium).
- Potential complications include hypoglycaemia and thrombocytopaenia.
- Rebound phenomenon is significant, especially with drugs with large volumes of distribution, where plasma levels rise after dialysis due to redistribution.

## Iv. Identification of Patients Requiring Specific Treatment with an Antidote
- Specific antidotes will be discussed under individual poisons.
- < 5% of poisons have a specific antidote.
- Sodium bicarbonate should be considered for toxins affecting sodium channels and in cases of cardiac toxicity.

## V. Nursing and Psychiatric Care
- Ensure comprehensive nursing and psychiatric care as part of the management strategy for poisoned patients.
# Specific Tests

  - **Elevated Gap (> 5%)**: Seen with elevated levels of carboxyhaemoglobin, methaemoglobin, or sulphaemoglobin.

# Toxidromes

A toxidrome is a specific constellation of signs and symptoms that arise from the similarities in the pharmacology of many poisons.

## Opioid Toxidrome
- **Typical Presentation**: Stimulation of opioid receptors producing general depression of autonomic activity.
  - **Triad**: Bradypnoea, miosis (pinpoint pupils), and a depressed mental state/coma.
  - **Other Symptoms**: Hypotension, pulmonary oedema, bradycardia, reduced bowel sounds, hypothermia.
  - **Predictive Response to Naloxone**: Respiratory rate < 12 breaths/min and miosis (sensitivity: 80% and 88%, specificity: 95% and 90% respectively).
  - **Notable Opioids**:
	- **Propoxyphene**: Withdrawn due to arrhythmias and overdose; causes sodium channel blockade, associated with prolonged QT.
	- **Pethidine, Propoxyphene, Tramadol**: Can cause seizures.

## Sedative/Hypnotic Toxidrome
- **Responsible Agents**: Benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, barbiturates, ethanol, benzodiazepine-like agents (e.g., zolpidem).
  - **Symptoms**: CNS depression, hallucinations, diplopia, nystagmus, ataxia, respiratory depression, hypothermia.
  - **Mechanism**: CNS depression enhanced by binding at postsynaptic GABA-A channels, promoting chloride influx and neuronal hyperpolarisation.
  - **Notable Drugs**:
	- **GHB, Methaqualone**: Lower seizure threshold and can cause paradoxical seizures in overdose.
  - **Withdrawal Syndrome**: Similar to sympathomimetic toxidrome; occurs after abrupt discontinuation of sedative-hypnotic agents (e.g., alcohol).

## Anticholinergic Toxidrome
- **Also Known As**: Antimuscarinic toxidrome.
- **Responsible Agents**: Tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, antiparkinsonian drugs.
  - **Symptoms**: Mydriasis, dry flushed skin, hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, hypoactive bowel sounds, CNS effects (delirium, hallucinations, memory loss, psychosis, seizures, carphologia).
  - **Severity**: Dose-related.
	- **Low Doses**: Dry mouth and skin.
	- **Moderate Doses**: Mydriasis, tachycardia, worsening anhidrosis.
	- **High Doses**: Central anticholinergic effects.
  - **Mnemonic**: "Blind as a bat, mad as a hatter, red as a beet, hot as hell, and dry as a bone."

## Cholinergic Toxidrome
- **Commonly Seen With**: Organophosphate poisoning.
  - **Symptoms**: Diaphoresis, bronchorrhoea, diarrhoea, lacrimation, emesis, urination, miosis, bronchospasm, muscle fasciculation, seizures, confusion.
  - **Cardiac Symptoms**: Bradycardia common, tachycardia may result from nicotinic receptor stimulation or hypoxia.
  - **Muscle Weakness/Paralysis**: Due to nicotinic hyperstimulation, responds poorly to atropine.
  - **Also Seen With**: Anticholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., neostigmine, physostigmine, edrophonium), toxic mushroom ingestion.

## Sympathomimetic Toxidrome
- **Responsible Agents**: Stimulants (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine, amphetamines, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, salbutamol, caffeine).
  - **Symptoms**: Hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, delusions, mydriasis, hyperthermia, seizures.
  - **Distinguishing Features**: Hyperactive bowel sounds, sweating, urinary retention. Pupils dilated but reactive.
  - **Mechanism**: Increased release of catecholamines, inhibition of reuptake, direct receptor stimulation, altered neurotransmitter metabolism.
  - **Treatment**: Depends on the toxin.
	- **Cocaine**: Responds well to benzodiazepines.
	- **Amphetamine**: Toxicity relatively resistant to treatment.

## Hallucinogenic Toxidrome
- **Responsible Agents**: Amphetamines, cocaine, phencyclidine (magic mushrooms).
  - **Symptoms**: Disorientation, hyperactive bowel sounds, panic, seizures, hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnoea, hallucinations.

## Serotonin Syndrome

- **Precipitated By**: Overdose of proserotonergic medications or drug interactions (e.g., pethidine and 5HT3 receptor antagonists).
  - **Early Symptoms**: Tachycardia, tremor.
  - **Severe Symptoms**: Hyperthermia, myoclonus, rigidity, opsoclonus, agitation, delirium, diaphoresis.
  - **Distinction**: Unlike neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome follows a predictable rise in synaptic serotonin concentration.

## Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

- **Associated With**: Use of neuroleptic agents.
  - **Symptoms**: Change in mental status, rigidity, hyperthermia, autonomic instability.
  - **Triad**: Lead-pipe rigidity (increased tone without tremor or cog-wheeling), hyperthermia, altered mental status.
  - **Severity Spectrum**: Life-threatening autonomic instability, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis indicate poor outcomes.
  - **Commonly Seen**: Following introduction of antipsychotics, or withdrawal of dopaminergic medication (e.g., levodopa).
  - **Diagnosis**: One of exclusion.

# Specific Toxins
## Aspirin

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314170728.png)

### Background
- Aspirin is converted to its active metabolite salicylic acid. Salicylates at toxic levels are metabolic poisons that:
  - Uncouple oxidative phosphorylation
  - Interfere with the Krebs cycle
  - Lead to accumulation of lactic acid and ketoacids

### Considerations
- Emergency/full stomach considerations
- Consider other toxins
- Potentially life-threatening emergency requiring monitoring:
  - Arterial line for frequent blood work
  - Consult toxicology, ICU, nephrology
- Severe acidosis:
  - Severe anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA) with compensatory respiratory alkalosis
  - Decreased pH favors tissue (e.g., brain) passage → toxic effects

### Phases of Presentation
1. **Phase 1 (up to 12 hours)**
   - Hyperventilation from direct stimulation of the respiratory center, leading to respiratory alkalosis and compensatory alkaluria.
   - Potassium and sodium bicarbonate are excreted in the urine; hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia may occur.
2. **Phase 2 (within hours to 12-24 hours)**
   - Paradoxical aciduria in the presence of continued respiratory alkalosis. This occurs when excess potassium has been lost in the urine and hydrogen ions are now excreted.
3. **Phase 3 (infants: 4-6 hours, adolescents and adults: after 24 hours)**
   - Dehydration, hypokalaemia, and progressive metabolic acidosis.

### Respiratory Considerations
- Respiratory alkalosis is a compensatory mechanism as alkalinization assists renal elimination.
- Cautious intubation: patient will not tolerate apnea and ICU ventilator is required.
- Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema can occur.

### Central Nervous System Considerations
- Uncooperative and co-intoxications
- Profound decreased level of consciousness (LOC)
- Cerebral edema
- Neuroglycopenia

### Assessment of Severity and Timing
- Activated charcoal if <1 hour since ingestion.
- Serum ASA levels (note that peak levels can be delayed by 6 hours).

### Dose-related Signs and Symptoms of Salicylate Poisoning

| **Dose of ingested salicylate (mg/kg)** | **Salicylate concentration (mg/L) in adults** | **Signs and symptoms**                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 150                                     | 300 - 600                                     | Nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, deafness, respiratory alkalosis                                                        |
| 250                                     | 600 - 800                                     | Peripheral vasodilatation, sweating, agitation, hypoglycaemia, decreased platelet function                         |
| 500                                     | > 800                                         | Metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, agitation, coma, cardiovascular collapse, (rarely pulmonary and cerebral oedema) |

### Treatment

#### Rapid Assessment & Stabilization of ABCs

#### GI Decontamination with Activated Charcoal
- 1st dose: 1 g/kg up to 50 grams PO, followed by 25 g PO every 2 hours for three doses.

#### Volume Resuscitation
- Administer unless cerebral or pulmonary edema is present.

#### Empirical Glucose
- Administer if altered LOC even if serum glucose is normal.

#### Urine Alkalinization with NaHCO3
- **Bolus**: 1 mEq/kg IV bolus.
- **Maintenance**: 150 mEq NaHCO3 in 1 L of D5W.
  - Start at 2x maintenance rate.
  - Titrate to urine pH > 7.5.
  - Continue until serum salicylate < 30 mg/dL.
  - Monitor and avoid:
	- Volume overload
	- Hypokalemia

#### Avoid Intubation if Possible
- Necessary for:
  - Airway protection
	- Lavage/charcoal administration
	- GCS < 8
	- Severe agitation and delirium, preventing medical procedures such as central venous catheter (CVC) placement and hemodialysis.
  - Severe hypoxemia from ASA-induced pulmonary edema.
  - Maintenance of hyperventilation if respiratory failure occurs (compensation for AGMA).

#### Hyperventilation
- Ensure ICU ventilator is available.
- An abrupt decrease in salicylate-induced hyperventilation may lead to life-threatening acidosis.

### Hemodialysis Indications
- Coma or cerebral edema
- Pulmonary edema or fluid overload (limits NaHCO3 administration)
- Renal failure that interferes with salicylate excretion
- Lethal salicylate concentration > 100 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L)
- Refractory AGMA despite aggressive management
## Paracetamol

### Background
- Hepatotoxic doses of paracetamol are generally accepted as occurring at a single dose of >150 mg/kg (approximately 10 g in the average 70 kg adult male). The median dose ingested by individuals who develop liver failure is 24 g.

### Metabolism
- **90% Conjugation**:
  - Glucuronidation via UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A6) accounts for the majority of the conjugation, and the remainder is sulphated through 2 sulfotransferases.
  - End products of glucuronidation and sulphation are inactive metabolites eliminated in urine and bile.
- **5% Oxidation**:
  - Paracetamol is oxidized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (predominantly CYP2E1) to form N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI).
  - NAPQI rapidly combines with glutathione in the liver, forming non-toxic conjugates eliminated in urine.
- **5% Eliminated unchanged**

### Pathophysiology of Overdose
- Overdose overwhelms glucuronidation and sulphation pathways, increasing paracetamol shunting into the CYP system, thus increasing NAPQI production.
- Hepatic glutathione stores become depleted, NAPQI cannot be inactivated, leading to covalent binding to cysteine groups on hepatocytes and mitochondrial proteins.
- Results in reduction of ATP, DNA damage, and intracellular protein modification, culminating in centrilobular necrosis of the liver.
- Centrilobular area has the greatest concentration of CYP2E1 and maximal NAPQI production.
- Inflammatory mediators propagate hepatocellular injury, indicating that covalent binding alone is not the sole mechanism of hepatic cell death.

### Factors Predisposing to Increased Risk for Liver Injury after Overdose
#### Age
- Children <5 years process paracetamol predominantly by sulphation, making them less susceptible to hepatotoxicity.
#### Chronic Liver Disease
- Patients with non-alcoholic liver disease are not at increased risk of paracetamol hepatotoxicity.
#### Alcohol
- Acute alcohol intake may be protective, competing with paracetamol for CYP.
- Chronic alcohol ingestion depletes glutathione and modifies CYP2E1 activity, doubling CYP2E1 activity up to 10 days after abstaining from alcohol.
#### Drugs
- Drugs inducing CYPs (e.g., antituberculous medication, anticonvulsants) may enhance paracetamol hepatotoxicity.
- Halothane induces CYP2E1.
#### Nutritional Status
- Fasting depletes glutathione and glycogen, enhancing paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity.
#### Tobacco Use
- Smokers who overdose on paracetamol have increased mortality rates due to potent inducers of CYP1A2 in tobacco smoke.

### Presentation Stages
#### Stage 1
- **Timing**: Within the first 24 hours post-ingestion.
- **Symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, malaise, diaphoresis, mild liver tenderness.
- **Lab Findings**: Blood tests usually normal, but hepatic enzymes may elevate within 8-12 hours.
#### Stage 2 (Latent Phase)
- **Timing**: 24 to 72 hours post-ingestion.
- **Symptoms**: Patients may appear well but exhibit biochemical evidence of hepatic dysfunction.
- **Lab Findings**: Elevated serum ALT, AST within 24-36 hours; bilirubin and INR may be elevated.
- **Complications**: Right upper quadrant pain, oliguria.
#### Stage 3 (Hepatic Stage)
- **Timing**: 72 to 96 hours post-ingestion.
- **Symptoms**: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, hepatic encephalopathy.
- **Lab Findings**: AST may exceed 10,000 IU/L, renal insufficiency in >50% of patients.
- **Complications**: Pancreatitis, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, elevated INR associated with high mortality.
- **Causes of Death**: Hepatocellular necrosis, cerebral edema, multi-organ failure, sepsis.
#### Stage 4 (Recovery Stage)
- **Timing**: 4 days to 2 weeks post-intoxication.
- **Prognosis**: 70% of patients with ALF will survive to stage 4; complete recovery usually by 7 days, histological resolution may take 3 months.

### Management
- **Absorption**: Rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract within 30-60 minutes; peak plasma levels reached within 1-3 hours.
- **Plasma Levels**: Ideally measured within 4 to 24 hours post-ingestion.

#### Prediction and Treatment of Hepatotoxicity
- **Rumack-Matthew Nomogram**: Used to plot serum concentration of paracetamol to predict risk of hepatotoxicity.
- **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)**:
  - **Mechanism**: Free radical scavenger, increases glutathione stores, enhances conjugation by sulphation, binds NAPQI.
  - **Administration**:
	- **Oral**: 140 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 17 doses.
	- **Intravenous**: 150 mg/kg loading dose over 15 minutes, followed by 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours.
  - **Indications**: Administer within 8 to 10 hours of acute overdose, beneficial up to 24 hours later. Continue NAC until INR < 2 in ALF patients.
- **Antidote**: NAC is the mainstay, ideally administered within 8-10 hours; reduces hepatotoxicity to <1% if given timely.
- **Considerations**: NAC also has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, inotropic, and vasodilating effects. Oral route may be preferable if therapy is delayed.

### Hemodialysis Indications
- Coma or cerebral edema.
- Pulmonary edema or fluid overload limiting NaHCO3 administration.
- Renal failure interfering with salicylate excretion.
- Lethal salicylate concentration >100 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L).
- Refractory AGMA despite aggressive management.
## Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST)

### Pathophysiology of Local Anaesthetic Toxicity

Local anaesthetic toxicity classically causes cardiac and neurological symptoms.

#### CNS
- The CNS is more vulnerable to the toxic effects of local anaesthetics than the cardiovascular system, and this susceptibility is increased in the setting of acidosis.
  - CNS excitation arises due to a blockade of inhibitory pathways in the cerebral cortex and an increase in the release of glutamate.

#### CVS
- CVS toxicity arises due to the direct effects of the local anaesthetic on the heart and peripheral vasculature, as well as indirect effects via blockade of parasympathetic or sympathetic activity.
  - Bupivacaine decreases the rate of depolarisation in the Purkinje fibres and ventricular muscle and slows the rate of recovery from use-dependent block.
  - Electrophysiologically, these effects are seen as prolongation of the QRS complex and PR interval.
  - Very high doses of local anaesthetics inhibit spontaneous depolarisation of the sinoatrial node.
  - All local anaesthetics exhibit dose-dependent negative inotropy.
  - Local anaesthetics demonstrate a biphasic action on peripheral vasculature.
	- At low doses, there is an increased tone in the vasculature.
	- At high concentrations, there is a decreased tone.
	- At very high blood levels, there is a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle in almost all vascular beds, causing profound peripheral vasodilatation.
	- This, coupled with the negative inotropy, results in the profound cardiovascular collapse seen with high doses of local anaesthetics.

### Signs & Symptoms
- Tinnitus, metallic taste, circumoral numbness
- Altered mental status
- Seizures
- Hypotension
- Bradycardia
- Ventricular arrhythmias
- Cardiovascular collapse

### Management

#### Immediate Actions
- Stop local anaesthetic injection and/or infusion.
- Call for help.

#### Initial Focus
- **Airway Management**: Ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation; administer 100% FiO2, consider endotracheal intubation, prevent hypoxia and acidosis (which aggravate local anaesthetic systemic toxicity, LAST).
- **Seizure Suppression**: Benzodiazepines are preferred. Avoid or minimize propofol if hemodynamically unstable. If seizures persist, use small doses of succinylcholine to minimize acidosis and hypoxia.
- **Alert Nearest Facility with Cardiopulmonary Bypass Capability**

#### Management of Cardiac Arrhythmias
- If pulseless, start CPR.
- ACLS may require adjustment of medications and possibly prolonged effort.
- Use epinephrine doses <1 mcg/kg (small boluses of 10-100 mcg IV).
- Avoid vasopressin, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and local anaesthetics.
- For ventricular arrhythmias, amiodarone is preferred; avoid lidocaine and procainamide.
- If refractory to treatment, consider cardiopulmonary bypass.

#### Lipid Emulsion (20%) Therapy
- Rapidly administer at the first signs of LAST: 1.5 mL/kg bolus (105 mL for a 70 kg adult) over 1 minute, then start infusion at 0.25 mL/kg/min.
- Repeat bolus once or twice for persistent cardiovascular collapse.
- May increase infusion rate (max 0.5 mL/kg/min) if blood pressure remains low.
- Continue infusion for at least 10 minutes after attaining circulatory stability.
- Recommended upper limit is 10 mL/kg over the first 30 minutes.
- Propofol is not a substitute for lipid emulsion.

#### Theories of Why Lipid Emulsion Works
- **Lipophilicity Theory**: Local anaesthetics are lipophilic compounds. By supplying a lipid sump, the volume of distribution of the local anaesthetic is decreased as it is drawn into the vascular compartment, thus limiting the target tissue concentration.
- **Impairment of Mitochondrial Lipid Metabolism**: Local anaesthetics bind to proteins, including carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (CAT). CAT assists the passage of fatty acids across the mitochondrial membranes, where they are oxidised to become an important source of energy for the heart. If CAT is inactivated by local anaesthetics, the free fatty acids will not be fully oxidised, depleting myocardial ATP. Administration of a large lipid load may overwhelm the inhibition of CAT, increasing the energy supply to the myocardium.
- Failure to respond to lipid emulsion and vasopressor therapy should prompt the institution of cardiopulmonary bypass (ECMO).
## Organophosphates

### Background

- **Common Incidents**: Organophosphate and carbamate poisonings are frequently encountered in South African medicine due to deliberate self-harm, accidental ingestion, or occupational exposure.
- **Mechanism of Action**: Both organophosphates and carbamates inhibit acetylcholinesterase, leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic nerve terminals. This is familiar to anaesthetists, as neostigmine, derived from carbamates, has a similar effect.
- **Absorption**: These agents are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and lungs. They inhibit both plasma and red cell cholinesterase, preventing acetylcholine breakdown.
- **Recovery**: Plasma cholinesterase typically recovers within 4 weeks, while red cell cholinesterase levels may remain low for months.
- **Duration**: Organophosphates bind irreversibly to cholinesterase, whereas carbamates usually clear spontaneously within 48 hours.

### Clinical Triphasic Response

- **Types of IMS**:
	- Type 1: Responds to atropine.
	- Type 2: Does not respond to atropine.
- **Duration**: Weakness may last for 2-3 weeks.
- **Cause**: Unknown, but potential causes include persistent acetylcholine excess at NMJ, downregulation of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors, muscle cell injury, and oxidative damage.

#### Organophosphate-induced Delayed Polyneuropathy (OPIDN)

- **Symptoms**: Sensory-motor axonopathy becoming apparent weeks or months after exposure, with the motor component usually more affected than the sensory component.
- **Cause**: Possibly related to inhibition of neuropathy target esterases.

### Considerations

- **Life-Threatening Emergency**: Multisystem failure is common.
	- **Respiratory**: Weakness, respiratory failure, bronchospasm, hypoxemia.
	- **Cardiovascular**: Hemodynamic instability.
	- **CNS**: Seizures, decreased level of consciousness (LOC).
- **Decontamination**: Essential to prevent exposure to medical personnel.

### Treatment

#### Initial Management

- **Intubation and Ventilation**: As appropriate.
- **Consultation**: Toxicology and ICU.
- **Atropine**: 2-5 mg IV, may need 15-20 mg until decreased secretions and adequate tidal volumes are achieved.
- **Pralidoxime**: 1000-2000 mg IV, then 1000 mg every 12 hours. Do not give pralidoxime without atropine.
- **Benzodiazepines**: For seizures. Phenytoin is ineffective.

#### Advanced Management

- **Paralysis for Airway Management**:
	- **Succinylcholine**: May result in prolonged paralysis due to acetylcholinesterase inhibition.
	- **Rocuronium**: Increased doses may be needed due to competitive inhibition at the neuromuscular junction.
## Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCA's)

### Background

- Ingestion of more than 10 mg/kg of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) produces significant toxicity, with 20-30 mg/kg being potentially lethal.
- Symptoms typically develop within 1 hour of a significant overdose.
- Patients who do not show signs of toxicity within 6 hours after an overdose can be discharged safely.
- Multi-system effects occur due to:
  - Blockade of cardiac fast sodium channels.
  - Antagonism of:
	- Central and peripheral muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (anticholinergic effects).
	- Peripheral α-1 adrenergic receptors.
	- Histamine (H1) receptors.
	- CNS GABA A receptors.
- The greatest risk of seizures and arrhythmias occurs within the first 6-8 hours of TCA ingestion.

### Considerations

- Emergency situation with a full stomach.
- Possible co-ingestants.
- Life-threatening multi-system effects include:
  - CNS: sedation, coma, seizures.
  - Cardiovascular: tachycardia, hypotension, myocardial dysfunction, lethal arrhythmias.
  - Anticholinergic toxidrome: characterized by redness, hyperthermia, mydriasis, dryness, and delirium.

### Treatment

- Immediate consultation with toxicology and ICU.
- Admit the patient to a monitored setting.
- Intubate and hyperventilate to promote alkalosis.
- Sedation with benzodiazepines and propofol to increase the seizure threshold.
- Gastric decontamination if ingestion occurred less than 1 hour ago and the airway is protected.
- Treat hypotension with fluids and vasopressors (norepinephrine).
- High risk of arrhythmias and seizures if QRS duration is greater than 100 ms:
  - Administer sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃):
	- 2-3 mEq/kg, then 3 amps/L at 250 ml/hr or double maintenance.
	- Goals: QRS duration less than 100 ms, stable blood pressure, serum sodium around 150 mEq/L, pH around 7.5.
	- Use 3% NaCl if pH is greater than 7.50 with persistent QRS elevation.
- Treatment of arrhythmias (VT/VF):
  - Follow ACLS protocols and defibrillate as necessary.
  - Administer lidocaine 1 mg/kg.
  - Use magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄) if prolonged QTc or Torsades de Points develops.
  - Amiodarone and procainamide are contraindicated.
- Management of seizures:
  - Treat with midazolam.
  - Avoid the use of phenytoin.
- Consider intralipid therapy for cardiac arrest or refractory hypotension.
- ECMO as a last resort.
- Hemodialysis is not effective.

### Contraindicated Therapies

- Anti-arrhythmic drugs:
  - Class IA (e.g., procainamide) and class IC agents (e.g., flecainide) due to inhibition of rapid sodium channels, similar to TCA effects.
  - Class III agents (e.g., amiodarone) due to QTc prolonging effects.
- Phenytoin.
- Flumazenil, as it can induce seizures.
## Cyanide Toxicity

### Considerations
- Life-threatening emergency with high morbidity and mortality.
- Immediate consultation with a medical toxicologist or poison control and prompt treatment are crucial.
- Coexisting conditions to consider:
  - Burns: potential carbon monoxide poisoning and smoke inhalation.
  - Co-ingestions.

### Treatment
- Consult toxicology and ICU.
- Secure the airway and administer 100% oxygen.
- Ensure all medical personnel are equipped with suits and respirators; decontaminate the patient by stripping and discarding clothing and washing all surfaces with soap and water.
- Administer antidotes:
  - **Cyanide scavengers:**
	- Intravenous hydroxocobalamin is the first-line treatment (dose: 70 mg/kg, may repeat once if needed).
	- Nitrates such as intravenous sodium nitrite and/or inhaled amyl nitrite.
	  - Note: these can form methemoglobin and cause hypotension, so hydroxocobalamin may be preferred.
  - **Sodium thiosulfate:** 25 mL of a 50% solution.
	- Hydrocyanic acid (HCN) is detoxified to thiocyanate by rhodanase in the body.
	- This process can be accelerated by providing sodium thiosulfate, which supplies sulfane sulfur for the enzyme.

## Alcohols Toxicity

### Methanol and Ethylene Glycol
- Methanol and ethylene glycol are toxic alcohols that can cause raised anion gap acidosis and elevated osmolar gap.
- These substances have mild CNS effects initially and are non-toxic until metabolized into highly toxic intermediates by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD).
- Diagnosis often relies on the combination of raised anion gap acidosis and osmolar gap, though these may vary based on the timing of presentation.
- Methanol is metabolized to format, leading to retinal toxicity, papilledema, and potential irreversible vision impairment. It can also affect the basal ganglia, causing parkinsonian symptoms.
- Ethylene glycol is metabolized to oxalic acid, which precipitates with calcium in tissues, particularly affecting renal tubules, myocardium, and CNS.

#### Management
- The goal is to prevent the metabolism to toxic intermediates.
- Antidotes like ethanol and fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole) inhibit ADH and can prevent metabolism if administered early.
- If metabolism has started, supportive therapy for acidosis (sodium bicarbonate) and hemodialysis to eliminate metabolites are necessary.
- Hemodialysis is essential for acidotic patients and those with high levels of toxic alcohols (>50 mg/dL).
- Continue antidote administration until toxic alcohol levels are below 20 mg/dL and symptoms resolve.
- In the absence of intravenous antidotes, an oral loading dose of 4 oz of 80 proof whiskey (40% ethanol) can be used.
- Methanol has a long half-life (43-54 hours), requiring prolonged antidote administration.
- Fomepizole is preferred due to its favorable side-effect profile compared to ethanol.
- Ethanol can cause hypoglycemia, hyperosmolarity, vasodilation, pancreatitis, liver damage, and inebriation.
- Supplement with cofactors like pyridoxine, thiamine, magnesium for ethylene glycol poisoning, and folic or folinic acid for methanol poisoning to help reduce toxicity.

### Metabolism of Ethylene Glycol and Methanol and Therapeutic Use of Fomepizole and Ethanol

**Methanol Pathway:**

1. Methanol
   - Alcohol dehydrogenase → Formaldehyde
	 - Aldehyde dehydrogenase → Formic Acid → H₂O + CO₂ (Folic acid)

**Ethylene Glycol Pathway:**

1. Ethylene Glycol
   - Alcohol dehydrogenase → Glycoaldehyde
	 - Aldehyde dehydrogenase → Glycolic Acid → Glycoxylic Acid
	   - Oxalic Acid (Mg²⁺, Pyridoxine) → Hippuric Acid

**Therapeutic Agents:**

- **Fomepizole / Ethanol:** Inhibit Alcohol Dehydrogenase in both pathways.

## Theophylline Toxicity

### Background
- Theophylline is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases intracellular cAMP and calcium, with a narrow therapeutic index.
- The risk of seizures and cardiac toxicity correlates with theophylline concentration, varying between acute and chronic toxicity.
- Sustained-release preparations may delay peak concentration by up to 24 hours.
- Therapeutic doses follow first-order kinetics, while higher doses follow zero-order kinetics due to enzyme saturation.
- Major toxicity concentrations differ between acute (550 pmol/L) and chronic (220 pmol/L) ingestions, likely reflecting intracellular cAMP accumulation rates.

### Clinical Presentation
- Symptoms: sinus tachycardia, tremor, vomiting, hypotension, tachycardia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia.
- Arrhythmias: atrial tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia.
- Metabolic derangements: hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperglycemia, hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, and respiratory alkalosis.

### Management
- Enhance fecal elimination with multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC) due to extensive enterohepatic cycling.
- Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, esmolol) to manage cardiovascular effects.
- Seizure management with caution: benzodiazepines may be ineffective, and phenytoin can worsen seizures; phenobarbital may be effective.
- Treat refractory vomiting with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, considering the risk of QT interval prolongation.
- Extracorporeal elimination (charcoal hemoperfusion preferred) in severe poisoning; hemofiltration as an alternative.

## Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

### Background
- Carbon monoxide (CO) is odorless, tasteless, colorless, and produced by hydrocarbon combustion.
- Volatile anesthetics can produce CO when used with CO₂ absorbents.
- CO binds to hemoglobin with higher affinity than O₂, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), impairing O₂ transport and delivery, and causing a leftward shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.
- CO can trigger an inflammatory cascade with delayed neurological effects.
- Symptoms: headache, malaise, nausea, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, confusion, seizures, loss of consciousness, and "cherry red" lips/skin.
- Diagnosis:
  - Standard SpO₂ does not detect CO poisoning.
  - COHb levels measured by co-oximetry on arterial blood gas (ABG).
	- Levels >5% in non-smokers or >10-15% in smokers indicate CO poisoning.
	- COHb levels do not correlate with poisoning severity.
- CO elimination depends on oxygenation and minute ventilation:
  - Room air: CO half-life ~4 hours.
  - High-flow oxygen via non-rebreather mask: CO half-life ~60-90 minutes.
  - 100% hyperbaric oxygen: CO half-life ~20-30 minutes.
- Mortality rate: 1-3%.

### Considerations
- Life-threatening emergency.
- Coexisting conditions:
  - Burns, smoke inhalation, cyanide toxicity.
- Multisystem failure:
  - Cardiovascular: myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias, pulmonary edema.
  - CNS: seizures, decreased consciousness, delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome.
  - Metabolic: profound lactic acidosis.

### Treatment
- Remove the patient from the CO source.
- Administer high-flow oxygen via non-rebreather mask until COHb <5%.
  - Intubate and ventilate with 100% oxygen if significant decrease in consciousness.
- Consult toxicology and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) specialist for severe cases.
- Initiate HBO treatment within 6 hours for:
  - COHb >25-40%.
  - COHb >15-20% in pregnant patients.
  - Loss of consciousness.
  - Severe metabolic acidosis (pH <7.2).
  - End-organ ischemia (chest pain, ECG changes, altered mental status).
- Identify the CO source to prevent risk to others (e.g., by the fire department).
## Digoxin Toxicity

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311161026.png)

## Methaemoglobinaemia (MetHb)

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314141910.png)

### Background
- Digoxin increases intracellular calcium in cardiac myocytes, which enhances contractility.
- Excessive intracellular calcium can lead to delayed after-depolarizations, potentially causing premature contractions and triggering arrhythmias.
- Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic window; factors affecting concentrations or enhancing toxicity include:
  - Renal impairment
  - Hypovolemia
  - Hypokalemia
  - Hypomagnesemia
  - Hypernatremia
  - Acidosis
  - Drug interactions
  - Poisoning/ingestion
  - Myocardial infarction (MI)
- ECG findings in digoxin toxicity:
  - Increased PR interval
  - Decreased QTc interval
  - ST segment depression
  - Diminished amplitude or inversion of T waves

### Considerations
- Medical emergency requiring consultation with toxicology and cardiology.
- Requires monitoring in an ICU or high-acuity unit.
- Potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias:
  - Ectopy and tachycardia: PVCs, bigeminy, VT, VF
  - Cardiac arrest from asystole or VF (usually fatal)
  - Bradyarrhythmia due to increased vagal tone
	- AV junctional and heart blocks

### Treatment
- Admit to a monitored unit.
- Consult toxicology and cardiology.
- Draw digoxin levels.
- Antidote: Digibind (Fab)
  - Dosing:
	- Known ingested digoxin dose: 2 vials of Fab for every mg of digoxin ingested.
	- Chronic toxicity or unknown dose: calculate number of vials using the formula: serum digoxin concentration (ng/ml) × weight (kg) / 100.
	- If serum levels cannot be awaited or in life-threatening toxicity: administer 10-20 vials.
  - Hyperkalemia is common in digitalis toxicity but should not be treated with potassium-lowering agents as Digibind will lower K+; additional correction can cause hypokalemia, worsening digoxin toxicity.
- Volume resuscitation if hypotension is present.
- Replace potassium and magnesium as necessary.
- Manage arrhythmias following standard ACLS algorithms.
- Avoid calcium even if hyperkalemic, as patients have intracellular hypercalcemia, which can worsen the condition.

## Lithium Toxicity

### Background
- Exact toxic dose is unknown, but adults ingesting more than 2400 mg or children ingesting more than 30 mg/kg require assessment for toxicity.
- Types of toxicity:
  - **Acute toxicity**: Overdose in a patient not regularly taking lithium, presenting mostly with GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Neurologic symptoms are delayed.
  - **Acute-on-chronic toxicity**: Acute overdose in a patient on daily lithium or due to sudden renal function decline, presenting with a mix of GI and neurologic symptoms.
  - **Chronic toxicity**: Patients on chronic lithium therapy becoming hypovolemic due to toxic drug effects, physical disability, or concurrent illness, leading to reduced renal excretion. Presents with neurologic signs (agitation, confusion, slurred speech) and neuromuscular irritability or tremor.
- Lithium prolongs both depolarizing and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade.
- May cause ECG changes, including T wave flattening/inversion and QRS widening, and conduction blocks.

### Considerations
- Potential cardiopulmonary instability requiring resuscitation.
- Potential hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalances (especially sodium).
- Potential neurologic dysfunction and seizures.
- Anesthesia-specific concerns:
  - Prolonged duration of muscle relaxants.
  - Association with conduction defects and ST changes on ECG.

### Management
- Consult toxicology, poison control, and nephrology.
- Ensure stable airway, breathing, and circulation.
- Manage seizures with benzodiazepines.
- Ensure normal volume status and sodium levels.
  - Lithium can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
- Consider GI decontamination within 1 hour of ingestion of instant-release lithium or within 4 hours of sustained-release lithium ingestion.
- Consult nephrology for hemodialysis with the following indications:
  - Severe toxicity symptoms (e.g., seizures, altered mental status, hypotension not resolving with IV fluids, rigidity, hypertonicity, myoclonus, cardiopulmonary collapse, life-threatening dysrhythmia) at any serum level.
  - Serum lithium concentration >4 mEq/L (4 mmol/L) in patients with impaired kidney function (eGFR <45 mL/min).
  - Serum lithium concentration >5 mEq/L (5 mmol/L).

## Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB) Overdose

### Background
- Two main categories of CCBs:
  - **Dihydropyridines** (e.g., Amlodipine, Felodipine): Preferentially block L-type calcium channels in the vasculature, acting as strong vasodilators with minimal effects on cardiac contractility or conduction.
  - **Non-dihydropyridines** (e.g., Verapamil, Diltiazem): Selectively block L-type calcium channels in the myocardium, acting as weak vasodilators with depressive effects on cardiac conduction and contractility.
- Clinical features of CCB toxicity:
  - Hypotension
  - Bradycardia (more common with non-dihydropyridines)
  - Usually clear mental status unless there is significant hypotension reducing cerebral perfusion.
  - ECG may show PR interval prolongation and bradycardia.
  - Hyperglycemia due to inhibition of calcium-mediated insulin release.

### Considerations
- Potentially profoundly unstable cardiovascular status with hypotension and bradycardia.
- If emergency surgery is needed, resuscitation and optimization will be required.

### Management
- Consult poison control, medical toxicologist, ICU, and cardiology.
- Admit the patient to ICU or a high-acuity floor with continuous cardiac monitoring.
- Gastrointestinal decontamination is controversial but should be considered within 2 hours of ingestion or within 4 hours for sustained-release formulations.
- Correct electrolyte abnormalities and acid-base disorders.
- For severely symptomatic patients, simultaneously implement the following:
  - Stabilize the airway as necessary (avoid induction agents that exacerbate hypotension).
  - Administer IV boluses of isotonic crystalloid.
  - Administer IV calcium.
  - Administer IV glucagon.
  - Administer IV high-dose insulin and glucose.
  - Administer IV vasopressor (e.g., norepinephrine).
  - Administer IV lipid emulsion therapy.
- For mildly symptomatic patients, start with IV crystalloids and atropine, progressing to the next agent only if prior therapies are ineffective:
  - Additional IV boluses of isotonic crystalloid.
  - IV calcium.
  - IV glucagon.
  - IV high-dose insulin and glucose.
  - IV vasopressor (e.g., norepinephrine).
  - IV lipid emulsion therapy.

## Methamphetamine (Crystal Meth) Toxicity

### Considerations
- Multi-system effects of acute abuse:
  - CNS: possible increased intracranial pressure (ICP), seizures, uncooperativeness, increased MAC.
  - Cardiovascular: hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac dysrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes, cardiovascular collapse (due to dehydration, neurotransmitter depletion, metabolic acidosis).
  - Metabolic: hyperthermia, malnutrition, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis.
- Chronic amphetamine abuse:
  - Decreased MAC and refractory hypotension (due to depletion of catecholamine stores).
  - Physiologic dependence.
  - Withdrawal management.
- Need for universal precautions during treatment.
## Cocaine Toxicity

### Effects

	- Arrhythmias
	- Coronary vasospasm causing angina or MI
	- Cardiomyopathy
	- Aortic dissection
	- Unopposed alpha with beta-blockade
  - Respiratory:
	- Restrictive lung disease (RLD): "crack lung", aspiration
	- Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum
	- Bronchospasm
  - Hematologic: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombocytopenia
  - Renal: renal infarction, rhabdomyolysis
  - Gastrointestinal: ischemia, ulceration, perforation

### Conflicts
- Difficult airway in an uncooperative patient
- Rapid sequence induction (RSI) in a patient with hemodynamic instability
- Regional anesthesia in an uncooperative patient or with coagulopathy
- Placental abruption, uncooperative obstetric (OB) patient, difficult airway

### Anesthetic Management
- Delay operating room (OR) if possible to optimize and allow for cocaine effects to wane
- Monitor in a high-acuity setting/ICU
- Full CAS monitors, 5-lead ECG, and arterial line
- Treat adrenergic crisis and uncooperative status with benzodiazepines as first line
- Chest pain management:
  - Consult cardiology urgently and maintain a broad differential diagnosis
  - Start with midazolam
  - Consider nitroglycerin (NTG) and phentolamine (1-2.5 mg every 5-15 minutes)
  - Avoid beta-blockers
- If urgent general anesthesia (GA) is required:
  - Pre-induction arterial line
  - Treat adrenergic tone as above
  - Deep titrated GA, avoid ketamine, accept aspiration risk
- Wide complex tachycardia: administer sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) 1-2 meq/kg until hemodynamic stability and QRS <120 ms
- Postoperative discharge to high-acuity/ICU

## Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Toxicity

### Background
- MAOIs treat psychiatric disorders (e.g., treatment-resistant depression) and Parkinson's disease
- Increase dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic neurotransmission (MAO B)
- Inhibit breakdown of tyramine, which can trigger norepinephrine release and precipitate hypertensive crisis in the context of drug-food (e.g., aged cheeses, cured meats) or drug-drug interactions

### Considerations
- Risk of serotonin syndrome if combined with other serotonergic medications
  - Avoid serotonergic analgesics (fentanyl, meperidine, tramadol); morphine is acceptable
- Risk of hypertensive crisis
  - Avoid indirect sympathomimetics, caution with direct agents
  - Avoid cocaine
- Overdose can be fatal; signs and symptoms may not appear for up to 12 hours
  - Symptoms: increased heart rate, irregular pulse, increased or decreased blood pressure, vascular collapse, respiratory depression/failure, hyperpyrexia, diaphoresis with cool clammy skin, agitation, coma, convulsions, dilated pupils, trismus

### Conflicts
- Stopping irreversible MAOIs >2 weeks preoperatively to reduce risk of serotonin syndrome/hypertensive crisis vs. potential exacerbation of depression/suicidal ideation
  - MAOIs need to be tapered to avoid discontinuation symptoms

### Management
- Refer to serotonin syndrome management
- Refer to hypertension management
- Overdose:
  - Supportive measures as needed
  - Urine acidification may accelerate excretion
  - Consider dialysis
  - Restrict dietary tyramine for 2 weeks

- Treatment: symptom management, synthetic THC

### Considerations
- Ascertain careful history of use (frequency, route, and amount)
  - Toxicology screen is not valuable
  - Assess for use of other drugs
- Rule out acute intoxication
  - May have violent emergence
  - Hypertension, fever, tachycardia may be confused with more serious syndromes (e.g., malignant hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome)
- Increased risk of MI in CAD patients within 1 hour after use
  - Delay elective surgery for 1 hour after acute use
- Increased risk of airway hyperreactivity
- Potential for:
  - Elevated intraoperative BIS (or unreliable BIS)
  - Larger induction dose requirements
  - Larger volatile anesthetic requirements
  - More postoperative pain; consider regional anesthesia

	- If benzodiazepines are inadequate, use vasodilators such as nitroglycerin (NTG), nitroprusside (NTP), or phentolamine
	- Beta-blockers are contraindicated
  - Seizures and agitation: use benzodiazepines
  - Hyponatremia:
	- Usually mild and resolves in 12-24 hours with water restriction
	- If severe (<120 mEq/L): use hypertonic 3% NaCl, 100 cc boluses every 10 minutes
  - Hyperthermia:
	- Severe (>41ºC): immerse in an ice bath
	- Moderate: use cooling blankets, cool water mist, fanning
