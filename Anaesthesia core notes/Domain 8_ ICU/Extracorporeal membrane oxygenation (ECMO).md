# Introduction
- Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of cardiopulmonary bypass. It is an artificial means of supplying oxygen, removing CO2 and/or providing cardiac output. Due to significant advancements in intensive care, perfusion technology, anticoagulation, circuit, pump and membrane engineering, modern ECMO is considered to be relatively safe and easy to implement
- ECMO vs CBP
	- Centrifugal pump
	- No reservoir
	- No blood air interaction = less anticoagulation
## Types
**Venous Arterial (VA) ECMO —** In **VA ECMO**, a catheter is placed in the vein on the right side of the neck which removes un-oxygenated blood from the body. A second catheter is placed in the artery on the right side of the neck which returns oxygenated blood from the ECMO circuit to the body. 
**Venous Venous (VV) ECMO—** In **VV ECMO**, a single catheter is placed in a vein. VV ECMO only provides support for the lungs, whereas VA provides support to the heart and the lung.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Types of ECMO
#### AV ECMO

Pros: 

	Simpler and easier to transport (no energy source/ small and light)

Cons:

	Requires a cardiac index of >2.5L/min/m2 (confirmed on echo and invasive monitoring)

	Limb ischaemia (too low placement of rigid arterial cannula)

#### VV ECMO
**Pros:**
	-Lower risk of embolic phenomenon
	-Full lung perfusion allows endocrine pulmonary function
	-Loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction reduces pulmonary pressure and  may reduce heart strain
**Cons:**
	-Not as good oxygenation as VA ECMO as increased venous oxygenation  causes a shunt in the lungs (mismatch perfusion)
	-Risk of recirculation if 2 cannulas fem-fem.
	Developments: Dual chamber single cannula = reduces incidence or recirculation. (drainage from IVC and SVC and return via RA)
	60% of CO with ECMO flows to oxygenate the patient.
## Important Trails
**CESAR trial** showed improved survival @ 6 months (63% vs 47%) in adults with severe acute respiratory failure
**ANZ ECMO Influenza** investigators showed a mortality rate of 21% (lower than previous published studies)
**Systematic review on ECMO in H1N1 pandemic** (Crit Care Med, 2010) found insufficient evidence for ECMO use among patients with H1N1
## Challenges in SA Context
1. Cost intensive (capital and maintenance)
2. Danger of unnecessary use
3. Possibility of use in futile situations
4. Requires a trained multidisciplinary team with access to a specialized intensive care and cardiothoracic and vascular surgical services
5. Sufficient volume of cases required to justify training, maintenance and upkeep of the service
6. Disparity between the private and public sector in terms of resources

- It is recommended that patients receiving E-CPR should also be cooled for 48–72 hours to augment neurological protection
## Anesthesia for Insertion of ECMO
### Considerations
- Severe Cardiorespiratory illness
	- Inotropes
	- IABP
	- Uncommon vent settings
- Where to perform
	- Transport is dangerous
- MDT
- Anticoagulate patient (ACT 150-180sec)
- Mechanical pump should have a flow rate of 20-30% of cardiac output (cardiac  output monitor attached to patient)
- Pump blood flow rate dictates oxygenation, Sweep gas flow affects CO2.
- Sats >85% adequate for survival
- Drugs can be administered via ECMO pump (Administer proximal to reservoir = acts as an air trap to avoid embolism but drug can be sequestered in ECMO circuit).
#### Transfer
- Indication for ECMO
- Self protection
- Critically ill patient
- Transfer (ABCDEFGH)
- Can procedure be done in ICU?
- CoagulationACT/ Bleeding risk during surgery
- Anaesthetic approachTIVA and BIS
- ECMO principles (CO2 and sweep speed, O2 and blood flow)
#### Pre Op
- Venous and arterial access
- Vent settings
- Inotropes
- Other drugs
- Large bore IV access
- Remove unnecessary equipment
- TOE
- Fluid warmers
##### Investigations
- Coagulation: TEG and target abnormalities
- ABG
- CXR
- ECG
- Can mark large vessels (IJ or IC) for surgeon
##### Monitors
- Basics
- Aline
- CVP
- NIRS
- TOE
#### Intra Op
##### Induction
- Commonly combinations of ketamine, midazolam, propofol or fentanyl
- NDMB
##### Heparin
- Heparin should be administered as a bolus 2–3 minutes prior to cannulation at a dose of between 75 to 100 IU/kg. An activated clotting time (ACT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) should be performed prior to and after heparin administration. A heparin infusion should be commenced within 60–90 minutes at a rate of 25–50 IU/kg/hour. ACT for cannulation should be in the range of 250–300 seconds, and for maintenance should be in the range of 180–250 seconds.
##### Cannulation
- Once cannulation is performed, the ECMO circuit will be connected and pump blood flow will be commenced.
	- ECMO pump flow should be set at 100–150 ml/kg/minute.
	- FiO2 of 100% should be set on the membrane oxygenator oxygen flowmeter and the gas flow or sweep should be set equal to the ECMO pump flow rate.
	- The ECMO pump flow rate will be adjusted to perfusion parameters such as serum lactate, and the gas flow rate will be adjusted to PaCO2 during the course of the ECMO run.
- Significant haemodynamic changes can occur during the period immediately after cannulation.
- Prior to cannulation the patient may be on high doses of inopressor agents.
- During cannulation, blood pressures may fall due to acute haemorrhage.
	- This can be treated with a rapid bolus of isotonic crystalloid or blood.
	- Immediately on initiation of ECMO, mean arterial pressures increase significantly requiring a cessation or marked reduction of inopressor support.
- During VV-ECMO, this is most likely due to improved oxygen delivery to the myocardium and reduced pulmonary vascular resistance.
- In the case of VA-ECMO, myocardial recovery is not expected to be that rapid, and it is most likely due to a direct increase in intra-aortic pressure from the arterial return cannula.
	- Inotropic agents should be stopped during VA-ECMO to reduce myocardial strain.
- On exposure of the patient’s circulation to the artificial plastic tubing and membrane, a release of inflammatory mediators occurs.
	- The resultant vasodilation and drop in systemic vascular resistance causes a drop in circulating effective blood volume and preload.
	- Mean arterial pressures fall as a consequence.
	- This phenomenon can occur within 15–30 minutes of initiation of ECMO.
	- Volume should be replaced with blood to an Hb of 10 g/dl, or isotonic crystalloid. Vasopressor agents should be considered to reduce the potential for fluid overload. ECMO circuit markers of an increased volume requirement include “shuddering” vibration of the circuit; a fall in pump flow rate despite constant revolutions per minute; and a fall in pre-oxygenator circuit pressures.
- Echocardiography can guide haemodynamic management after ECMO institution.
- Important potential complications to exclude after ECMO initiation are pericardial tamponade, left ventricular distention and improper cannulae placement.
- Once on ECMO, ventilation should be kept on lung protective settings.
	- The following settings are recommended: PEEP between 8–10 cmH20; tidal volume of 4–6 ml/kg; driving pressure (plateau minus PEEP) less than 15 cmH20; and FiO2 under 40%.
- On initiation of ECMO, exposure of blood to ambient temperature via the circuit tubing and oxygenator can cause a decrease in body temperature.
- In neonates and children, this is especially significant, as the proportion of blood volume exposed to ambient temperature at any one time is larger than adults.
- A fall in body temperature can cause life-threatening arrhythmias or coagulation abnormalities.
- To avoid this problem, it is recommended that a water heat exchanger is utilised routinely on the circuit.
- Other conventional means of temperature management should also be considered, for example, convective warm air blankets.
##### Decannulation
- Slowly turn down to blood flow (lowest 1-1.5L/min) and look at the following parameters:
- EF (>20-25%)
- VTI (>10)  
- Mitral annulus (<6cm)

Note: ECMO centre not all patients referred went on to ECMO.
**ECLS registry**
Registry of who is getting ECMO and who survives. Does not show what condition they are in at discharge.
**2010-2011 H1N1 pandemic**
Numerous case control studies showing benefit  
**2018 EOLIA trial**
Early initiation of VV ECMO does not provide a mortality benefit to patients with very severe ARDS compared to conventional ARDS strategies with rescue ECMO therapy.
