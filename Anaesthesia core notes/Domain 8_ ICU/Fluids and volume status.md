# Glycocalyx

## Structure

The glycocalyx is a sugar-protein coat found on the apical surface of healthy vascular endothelium. It is a negatively charged mesh, approximately 2-3 µm thick, anchored into the vascular endothelium by glycoproteins and proteoglycans, which serve as backbone molecules. The luminal side is exposed to blood flow, maintaining a dynamic equilibrium between the flowing blood and the glycocalyx, which affects its composition and thickness. In conditions like sepsis, shedding of the endothelial surface layer (ESL) occurs, compromising glycocalyx functionality.

## Components

The glycocalyx consists of a negatively charged mesh of:

### Glycoproteins
- **Selectins**: E and P selectins facilitate leucocyte interactions.
- **Integrins**: Mediate cell-cell adhesion and permeability.
- **Immunoglobulin Superfamily**: Includes I-CAM 1, 2, VCAM, and Glycoprotein 1b-IX-V complex (coagulation).
### Proteoglycans
- Serve as backbone molecules.
- Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linked to these and have a protein core to which negatively charged GAG side chains are attached. This structure prevents certain substances from passing through and repels platelets.
- The five GAG chains include heparin (50-90%), hyaluronic acid, keratin, dermatan, and chondroitin.
### Glycolipids

## Functions
1. **Protection of Blood Vessels**:
   - Prevents coagulation by repelling platelets with a negative charge.
   - Protects against inflammation and atherogenesis.
   
2. **Selective Permeability**:
   - Acts as a "small pore" system, allowing molecules smaller than 10,000 Da to pass while preventing albumins, aiding tissue hydration and reducing oedema.
   
3. **Lubrication Layer**:
   - Assists in the passage of red blood cells through capillaries.
   - Buffers shear stress, facilitating nitric oxide (NO) release.
   
4. **Prevention of Leucocyte Adhesion**:
   - GAGs repel leucocytes, although this function is compromised by TNF-alpha, facilitating binding.
   
5. **Regulation of Ligand-Receptor Interactions and Cell Signalling**:
   - Contains enzymes like endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3), angiotensin-converting enzyme, antithrombin-III, lipoprotein lipase, apolipoproteins, growth factors, and chemokines.
## Enzymes Contained in Glycocalyx
- Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
- Extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3)
- Angiotensin-converting enzyme
- Antithrombin-III
## Significance

Disruption of the glycocalyx can occur with excessive fluid administration, leading to conditions such as pulmonary oedema. Proper management of fluid administration is crucial to maintaining the integrity and functionality of the glycocalyx.
