# Acid-Base

## Definitions

### pH

pH is the dimensionless measure of the acidity of an aqueous solution, defined as:

\[\text{pH} = -\log[H⁺] \]

### Difference Between Bicarbonate and Standard Bicarbonate
- **Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻)**: Calculated from the pH and PCO₂; useful for assessing metabolic disturbances only if there is no respiratory abnormality.
- **Standard Bicarbonate**: Equilibrates the bicarbonate concentration with standard conditions (PaCO₂ 40 mmHg (5.3 kPa), T° 37°C, Hb fully saturated with O₂), effectively negating the respiratory component.

### Difference Between Base Excess and Standard Base Excess
- **Base Excess**: Calculates the amount of acid or alkali required to return the plasma in vitro to a normal pH under standard conditions.
- **Standard Base Excess (SBE)**: Predicts the same in vivo, calculated by approximating Hb to 5 g/dL, considering haemoglobin's buffering effect on plasma and the extracellular fluid.

**SBE represents the best measure of metabolic disturbance.**

## Acidosis/Alkalosis

### Effects of Acidosis on the Body at pH <7.20
- **Cardiac**: Increased sympathetic nervous system activity, decreased myocardial contractility, resistance to catecholamines.
- **Systemic Vasculature**: Arteriolar vasodilation, venoconstriction.
- **Pulmonary Vasculature**: Vasoconstriction.
- **Respiratory**: Hyperventilation (Kussmaul), right shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve (OHDC), increased work of breathing (WOB) due to indirect bronchoconstriction from the parasympathetic nervous system.
- **Central Nervous System**: Vasodilation leading to increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Hypercapnia causes vasodilation.
- **Electrolytes**: Hyperkalemia (Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase leak), hypercalcemia (displacement from albumin by H⁺).
- **Endocrine**: Bone decalcification as bone phosphate is mobilized to buffer H⁺.

#### Effect on Clotting
- Interferes with the activity of factor Xa/Va prothrombinase complex, reducing thrombin production, delaying fibrin production, altering fibrin structure, and increasing susceptibility to fibrinolysis.
- **Summary**: Enhances fibrinolysis and inhibits factor Xa/Va complex.

#### Effect on Calcium
- As pH decreases, H⁺ displaces Ca²⁺ from binding sites, increasing ionized calcium (iCa²⁺).
- As pH increases, albumin and globulins bind more calcium, decreasing iCa²⁺.

### Effects of Alkalosis on the Body
- Shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left.
- Causes hypokalemia and hypocalcemia.
- Induces bronchoconstriction.
- Decreases cerebral blood flow (hypocarbia).
- Causes pulmonary vasodilation (hypocarbia).

## Other Information
- **Conversion from mmHg to kPa**: mmHg ÷ 7.5
- **Venous PCO₂**: 0.5-0.8 kPa > arterial PCO₂, thus venous blood pH is 0.05 lower.
- **Potassium Movement**: 0.6 mEq/L for each 0.1 change in pH.
- **Base Excess**: Amount of titratable acid required to return pH to 7.40.
- **Correct Anion Gap for Albumin**: AG + (0.25 × (40 - albumin in g/dL))
- **Normal Gradient**: <10 mmHg plus 1 mmHg per decade of life.

## Stewart Acid-Base

### Base-Excess Equation

Base-excess = (Na - Cl - 35) + (1 - lactate) + {0.25 x (42 - albumin)} + other ions

### Base Values
- **pH**: 7.40
- **Pco₂**: 40 mmHg
- **HCO₃⁻**: 24 mmol/L at 37°C

### Three Variables
1. **Strong Ion Difference (SID)**: (Na⁺ - Cl⁻ + lactate)
2. **Weak Acid Concentration**: Albumin (Alb) and phosphate (PO₄).
3. **Partial Carbon Dioxide Pressure (PCO₂)**.

#### Stewart vs. Bicarbonate-Centered Models
- **Stewart's Principle**: Concentrations of hydrogen ions (pH) and bicarbonate ions are not independent determinants of acid-base status, but results of changes in other systems.
- **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**: Still important for Stewart's approach; bicarbonate describes acid-base status but does not cause it. Bicarbonate is a marker, not a mechanism.

#### BE or Deficit
- Amount of acid (HCl) or base (NaOH) to be added to a litre of blood to return pH to 7.4 at 37°C and PaCO₂ of 40 mmHg.

#### Strong Ion Difference (SID)
- **Ions**: Completely dissociate in plasma.
  - **Cations**: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺
  - **Anions**: Chloride and lactate
  - **Simplified SID**: (Na⁺ - Cl⁻); Normal = 35 (140 - 105)
  - **Low SID**: Indicative of acidosis
  - **High SID**: Indicative of alkalosis

*Gablegram*: The gap between cations and anions is filled with bicarbonate and weak acids (albumin). If the gap increases, there is more space for HCO₃⁻; if the gap decreases, HCO₃⁻ is "squeezed out".

For every 1 meq/L change in the Na⁺-Cl⁻ difference, base excess will change by 1 meq/L (negative for decrease in SID, positive for increase in SID).

#### Weak Acids
- Partly dissociated proton donors (not strong ions): Albumin and phosphate.
- Changes in HCO₃⁻ and pH are secondary to changes in SID or the total amount of weak acids or both.
  - **Acidosis**: Decreased SID or increased weak acid. HCO₃⁻ decreases with increased weak acid (Alb/PO₄), HCO₃⁻ is squeezed out (Gablegram).
  - **Alkalosis**: Increased SID or decreased weak acid. HCO₃⁻ increases in response; there is more space.

*Critically ill patients*: Low albumin with a low SID results in more space for HCO₃⁻ ions, causing alkalosis.

##### Lactate
- A strong anion.
- **Lactate BE Effect**: 1 - measured lactate.

##### Albumin
- A weak acid. Calculate effective ionic concentration.
- **Albumin BE Effect**: 0.25 × (42 - albumin in g/L).

For every 10 g/L decrease in plasma albumin, base excess increases by 2.5 meq/L, making the patient more alkalotic.

#### Example
- **Plasma Chemistry**: Sodium, 133 mmol/L; chloride, 110 mmol/L; albumin, 22 g/L; lactate, 5 mmol/L.
- **Arterial Blood Gas**: pH, 7.20; Pco₂, 40 mmHg; bicarbonate, 15 mmol/L; standard base excess, -11.5 mmol/L.

Calculations:

1. Sodium chloride base-excess effect = 133 - 110 - 35 = -12 meq/L
2. Lactate base-excess effect = 1 - 5 = -4 meq/L
3. Albumin base-excess effect = 0.25 × (42 - 22) = +5.5 meq/L
4. Given base excess is -11.5 meq/L, the other ions base-excess effect = -1 meq/L

To determine the effect of other ions (cations: prot/lithium/aluminium; anions: phosphate/sulfate/acetate):

Other Ions = BE - (Na - Cl - 35) - (1 - lactate) - {0.25 x (42 - albumin)}

### Example of Applying the Simplified Stewart Approach

An intubated and ventilated patient with known cirrhosis is transferred from the emergency room for a laparotomy. The patient has had saline resuscitation.

Plasma chemistry: sodium, 133 mmol/L; chloride, 110 mmol/L; albumin, 22 g/L; and lactate, 5 mmol/L  
Arterial blood gas: pH, 7.20; PCO₂, 40 mm Hg; bicarbonate, 15 mmol/L; standard base excess, -11.5 mmol/L.

1. The sodium chloride base-excess effect = 133 - 110 - 35 = -12 meq/L (Equation 1)  
2. Lactate base-excess effect = 1 - 5 = -4 meq/L (Equation 2)  
3. Albumin base-excess effect = 0.25 x (42 - 22) = +5.5 meq/L (Equation 3)  
4. Given base excess is -11.5 meq/L, the other ions (OI) base-excess effect = -1 meq/L (Equation 5)

If we use a bicarbonate-based approach, this patient has an acidemia and decreased bicarbonate level suggesting a metabolic acidosis with inadequate respiratory compensation (expected PCO₂ approximately 30.5 mm Hg: 1.5 x bicarbonate + 8) and therefore a mixed disorder with increased lactate. The base excess alone tells us that there is a quantitatively important metabolic acidosis (expected PCO₂ approximately 29.5 mm Hg: 40 + base excess) and therefore a mixed disorder, with an elevated lactate.

The simplified Stewart approach tells us this information, and also, quantitatively, that much of the change in base excess is secondary to a relative hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis partly offset by decreased albumin and aggravated by lactic acidosis. It also tells us that other ions do not currently play a major role. This finding is consistent with saline resuscitation in a patient with cirrhosis and an abdominal surgical problem. In addition to surgery and increased ventilation, a switch to lower chloride fluids such as Plasmalyte would be expected to widen the NaCl difference and decrease the acidosis. If Plasmalyte administration (Na 140 mmol/L and Cl 98 mmol/L) were to increase sodium by 1 meq/L and decrease chloride by 3 meq/L, the base excess would be expected to improve by 4 meq/L. Furthermore, because albumin is a weak acid, administering albumin will increase the total weak acid concentration and will increase the metabolic acidosis. This effect is in addition to adverse clinical chemistry effects of the crystalloid carrier for albumin that may increase the chloride concentration and that may sustain or worsen the NaCl base-excess effect by further decreasing the strong-ion difference. Finally, from a Stewart perspective, sodium bicarbonate may be seen as chloride-free sodium that will increase the NaCl difference.

## Difference between the Strong Ion Difference and the Strong Ion Gap

- **Effective Strong Ion Difference (SIDe):** Sum of concentrations of Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺ minus the sum of Cl⁻ and lactate.
- **Apparent Strong Ion Difference (SIDa):** Includes weak acids (bicarbonate, protein, plasma phosphate) and unidentified anions (ketoacids, sulfate, format, salicylate).
  - The SID in any solution is defined as the sum of all the strong base cation concentrations minus the sum of all the strong acid anion concentrations.
  - This is known as the apparent strong ion difference (SIDa) because it does not take into account the role of weak acids that function as the most important buffers of human beings (weak acids deriving from CO2, proteins and phosphate).
  - A more complicated formula considering these factors has been developed later by Figge et al and it allows the calculation of the effective strong ion difference (SIDe).
  - The strong ion gap (SIG) is the difference between SIDa and SIDe and it represents the contribution to SID of unmeasured anions like sulfate, keto-acids, citrate, pyruvate, acetate and gluconate.

### Strong Ion Difference and how Does it Explain Acidosis from Normal Saline? How Does Ringer's Lactate Differ in This Light?

The Strong Ion Difference (SID) is defined as the difference between the positivelyand negatively-charged strong ions in plasma.

**SID** = (Na⁺ + K⁺ + Ca²⁺ + Mg²⁺) - (Cl⁻ + Lactate)

NB: SID vs AG!

The Stewart approach to Acid-Base holds the SID to be an independent determinant of pH. Normally +40 mEq/L

- ↑ SID ⇒ excess cations ⇒ less H⁺ needed → water dissociation inhibited → ↓ H⁺ → metabolic alkalosis
- ↓ SID ⇒ excess anions ⇒ more H⁺ needed → ↑ water dissociation → ↑ H⁺ → metabolic acidosis

**NS** causes ↑ Cl⁻ > ↑ Na⁺ (which is trapped intravascularly) ⇒ ↓ SID → excess anions → more H⁺ needed → ↑ water dissociation → ↑ H⁺ ⇒ metabolic acidosis

**RL** has less Cl⁻ than NS (112 vs 154 mmol/L). Lactate is metabolized to bicarbonate → tendency to alkalosis. K⁺ will ↑ SID → ↓ water dissociation.

## Regulation of Acid Base

### Respiratory

- Peripheral chemoreceptors are sensitive to changes in PO₂, PaCO₂, and pH, while central chemoreceptors respond to changes in PaCO₂ only.
  pH = pKa + log(HCO₃⁻/CO₂)
- **Metabolic Acidosis:** ΔpH sensed by peripheral chemoreceptors → stimulate respiratory centre → ↑ V̇A → ↑ CO₂ elimination → ↑ pH
- **Hypercarbia:** Detected by central + peripheral chemoreceptors → double stimulation of respiratory centre (hypercarbia [central + peripheral] + acidaemia [peripheral only]) → ↑↑ V̇A → ↑ CO₂ elimination → ↑ pH
- **Alkalemia:** Stimulates peripheral chemoreceptors only → limited ↓ V̇A → ↓ CO₂ elimination → ↓ pH

## Homeostatic Response of Acid-Base Load in the Body

1. **Chemical Buffering:** Extracellular (EC) and intracellular (IC) buffers.
2. **Alveolar Ventilation:** Controls pCO₂ and affects systemic pH.
3. **Renal H⁺ Excretion:** Regulates plasma bicarbonate concentration.

**Mechanisms of H⁺ Secretion:**

- **Proximal Tubule (PT) and Thick Ascending Limb of the Loop of Henle (TALH):** Na⁺-H⁺ exchanger.
- **Collecting Tubule (CT):** Active H⁺ ATPase.

**Acid and Alkali Sources:**

- **Acid:** Metabolism of cationic and sulfur-containing amino acids (AAs).
- **Alkali:** Metabolism of anionic AAs and organic anions (OA) such as citrate and lactate.

## NH₄⁺ Excretion

1. **H⁺ Excretion:**
	- Kidneys excrete 50-100 mEq/day of noncarbonic acid via NH₄⁺ excretion.
	- H⁺ ions bind to NH₃ or are titratable acids like phosphates and sulfates.
2. **Bicarbonate Reclamation:**
	- Kidneys reabsorb ~3360 mEq of bicarbonate per day via Na⁺-H⁺ exchange and carbonic anhydrase activity.
3. **NH₄⁺ Excretion Pathways:**
	- **PT:** NH₄⁺ excreted on NHE3.
	- **Thick Ascending Limb (TAL):** NH₄⁺ reabsorbed via NKCC.
	- **α-Intercalated Cells:** Active H⁺ ATPase pump in the lumen.
	- **Medulla:** Recycling of ammonia.

**Factors Affecting Net Acid Excretion:**

- Extracellular pH
- Protein catabolic rate
- Aldosterone levels
- Plasma K⁺ levels

# Approach to ABG

![](Pasted%20image%2020240216165748.png)

## Normal ABG on Room Air

- **pH**: 7.40
- **pCO2**: 40 mmHg
- **HCO3**: 24 mEq/L
- **Normal O2**: > 80 mmHg
- **Normal Anion Gap (AG)**: 12 ± 2

## Steps to Interpret Acid-Base Disturbances

### 1. Adequate Oxygenation?

- **Normal O2**: > 80 mmHg
- **Possible Hypoxemia**: Consider if pO2 is less than expected.

### 2. Define the Acid-Base Disturbance

- **pH < 7.40**: Acidemia
	- **Metabolic Acidosis**: Gain of acid or loss of HCO3⁻
	- **Respiratory Acidosis**: Hypoventilation, increased pCO2
- **pH > 7.40**: Alkalemia
	- **Metabolic Alkalosis**: Gain of HCO3⁻ or loss of acid
	- **Respiratory Alkalosis**: Hyperventilation, decreased pCO2

### 3. Identify the Primary Process

- **Metabolic Acidosis**:
	
	- **Acute**: HCO3⁻ < 24 mEq/L with corresponding pCO2 compensation
	- **Chronic**: Same pattern but over longer duration
- **Respiratory Acidosis**:
	
	- **Acute**: Elevated pCO2 with minimal change in HCO3⁻
	- **Chronic**: Elevated pCO2 with compensatory increase in HCO3⁻
- **Metabolic Alkalosis**:
	
	- **Acute**: HCO3⁻ > 24 mEq/L with compensatory increase in pCO2
	- **Chronic**: Same pattern but over longer duration
- **Respiratory Alkalosis**:
	
	- **Acute**: Decreased pCO2 with minimal change in HCO3⁻
	- **Chronic**: Decreased pCO2 with compensatory decrease in HCO3⁻

### 4. Compensatory Mechanisms

- **Metabolic Acidosis**: Decreased pCO2 expected
- **Respiratory Acidosis**: Increased HCO3⁻ expected
- **Metabolic Alkalosis**: Increased pCO2 expected
- **Respiratory Alkalosis**: Decreased HCO3⁻ expected

### 5. Calculate Anion Gap (AG)

- **AG**: Na⁺ - (Cl⁻ + HCO3⁻)
	- **Normal AG**: 12 ± 2
	- **High AG**: Presence of unmeasured anions

### 6. Normal AG Metabolic Acidosis (NAGMA)

- **Causes**:
	- GI Losses of HCO3⁻ (Diarrhea)
	- Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA)

### 7. High AG Metabolic Acidosis (HAGMA)

- **Causes**: Accumulation of acids like lactate or ketones, renal failure, toxins.

### 8. Compensation and Mixed Disorders

- **Winter’s Formula for Metabolic Acidosis**: Expected pCO2 = 1.5 × (HCO3⁻) + 8 ± 2
- **Delta-Delta (Δ/Δ) Ratio**: Used to identify mixed disorders

## Metabolic Acidosis Considerations

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311093522.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311094113.png)

### Winter’s Formula

PCO2=(1.5×HCO3)+8

- **Interpretation:**
	- If measured PCO2 > calculated PCO2: Concurrent respiratory acidosis is present.
	- If measured PCO2 < calculated PCO2: Concurrent respiratory alkalosis is present.

### Delta Gap (Δ gap)

Δgap=AG−12+HCO3

- **Interpretation:**
	- If Δ gap < 22 mEq/L: Concurrent non-gap metabolic acidosis exists.
	- If Δ gap > 26 mEq/L: Concurrent metabolic alkalosis exists.

### MUDPILES (High Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis - HIGMA)

- **M**: Methanol
- **U**: Uremia
- **D**: Diabetic ketoacidosis
- **P**: Paraldehyde
- **I**: Infection, In therapy
- **L**: Lactic acidosis
- **E**: Ethanol, ethylene glycol
- **S**: Salicylates (aspirin)

### Causes of Normal Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis (NAGMA)

- Excessive administration of 0.9% normal saline
- **Gastrointestinal losses:** Diarrhea, ileostomy, neobladder, pancreatic fistula
- **Renal losses:** Renal tubular acidosis
- **Drugs:** Acetazolamide
### Lactic Acidosis

#### Definition and Types

- **Lactic Acidosis**: Elevated blood lactate levels > 2 mmol/L
	- **Type A**: Impaired oxygen delivery (e.g., shock, hypoxia)
	- **Type B**: Impaired oxygen utilization (e.g., mitochondrial dysfunction)
	- **Type D**: Bacterial overgrowth

#### Pathophysiology

- **Anaerobic Glycolysis**: Pyruvate converted to lactate when oxygen is scarce
- **Lactate Clearance**: Liver and kidneys play major roles

#### Causes of Increased Lactate Production

- **Hypoxia**: Decreased oxygen delivery (e.g., cardiac arrest, sepsis)
- **Increased Oxygen Demand**: Exercise, seizures
- **Impaired Clearance**: Liver disease, renal failure

#### Treatment Approaches

- **Address Underlying Cause**: Oxygen delivery, removal of toxins
- **Supportive Measures**: IV fluids, bicarbonate in severe cases
