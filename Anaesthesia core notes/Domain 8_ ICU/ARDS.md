# ARDS

## Definition

Acute diffuse, inflammatory lung injury, leading to increased pulmonary vascular permeability, increased lung weight, and loss of aerated lung tissue with hypoxemia and bilateral radiographic opacities, associated with increased venous admixture, increased physiological dead space, and decreased lung compliance.

### Berlin Criteria (2013)
**Timing**: Within one week of known insult.  
**Imaging**: Bilateral opacities not explained by another process.  
**Origin of Edema**: Respiratory failure not explained entirely by volume overload or CHF.  
**Impaired Oxygenation**: PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio < 300 (PEEP of 5cmH2O).

### Severity Scoring: PF Ratio (mmHg) at 5cmH2O
- **Mild**: 200-300
- **Moderate**: 100-200
- **Severe**: <100 (45% mortality)

## Pathophysiology
**Injury (Immune mediated)**  
**Exudative**: Alveolar capillary membrane disruption with inflammatory cell infiltrate and high protein exudate forming hyaline membranes. Characterized by mass migration of neutrophils into alveoli.  
**Proliferative**: Proliferation of abnormal Type II alveoli cells and inflammatory cells with less surfactant production.  
**Fibrotic**: Infiltration with fibroblasts, replacing alveoli and alveolar ducts with fibrosis.  
**Resolution**: Slow and incomplete repair and restoration of architecture.

### Result of Pathophysiology Explained
- **Hypoxaemia**: V/Q mismatch, impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.
- **Increased Dependent Densities**: Surfactant dysfunction, alveolar instabilities.
- **Decreased Compliance**: Surfactant dysfunction, decreased lung volume, fibrosis.
- **Collapse/Consolidation**: Increased compression of dependent lung.
- **Increased Minute Ventilation**: Increased alveolar dead space.
- **Increased Work of Breathing**: Increased elastance, increased minute volume requirement.
- **Pulmonary Hypertension**: Vasoconstriction, microvascular thrombi, fibrosis, PEEP.

### Description of Pathophysiology

The pathophysiological mechanisms of ARDS vary depending on the causative pathology, but several common inflammatory pathways that subsequently cause alveolar damage are involved. These inflammatory processes cause endothelial damage, disrupt normal protective barriers, inhibit surfactant production and function, impair coagulation, and inhibit normal alveolar immunological responses. Increased vascular permeability and damage to the pulmonary microvasculature result in fluid and neutrophil leakage into alveolar and interstitial tissue. The result is impaired gas exchange due to damaged alveolar-capillary membranes, and the two hallmark features of ARDS: hypoxaemia and reduced lung compliance. These lung changes are rarely homogeneous and result in areas of disease interspersed with normal lung units. The stretching at the interface of diseased and healthy lung also causes excessive shear stress, perpetuating the release of inflammatory mediators and exacerbating local and systemic inflammation.

## Aetiology of ARDS
**Direct**: Pneumonia, Inhalational lung injury, Lung contusion, Aspiration, Drowning.  
**Indirect**: Sepsis, Polytrauma, Pancreatitis, Massive transfusion.

### Explain the “Baby Lung” in ARDS

ARDS predominantly affects the dorsal lung regions (gravity), which are the best perfused. The remaining aerated part of the lung is small and exposed to the risk of Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI). The baby lung refers to the remaining aerated region. Due to a combination of reduced compliance, collapse/consolidation, and shunting, there is impaired oxygenation.

### What is VILI in ARDS

VILI refers to damage to the remaining aerated lungs due to supramaximal mechanical power (energy applied over time) applied to this lung.  
**Volutrauma**: Excessive stretch of lung tissue.  
**Atelectrauma**: Rapid opening and closure of the alveoli, applying more power over time with more resultant stress and subsequent inflammation.  
**Barotrauma**: Excessive pressure.

## 7 P's of Management of ARDS
**Problem**:
- Manage the underlying problem (aetiology).

**Protective Ventilation**:
- Tidal Volume (TV): 4-6 ml/kg IBW.
- PEEP: Optimize PEEP (usually high).
- FiO2: Aim for at least PaO2= 7.3 kPa, titrate.
- SpO2: 88-95%.
- Recruitment manoeuvres.
- Driving pressure (Plateau - PEEP) < 15 cmH2O.
- Plateau pressures < 30 cmH2O.
- Permissive hypercapnia (pH > 7.2). Titrate RR.
- Avoid ventilator dyssynchrony.

**Proning**:
- 16 hours a day.

**Paralysis**:
- Cisatracurium with deep sedation (prevent awareness).

**Peeing and Pleural Drainage**:
- Conservative fluid strategy.
- Diuresis if fluid overloaded.
- Drain pleural effusions.

**Prostacyclin or NO**:
- Reduce V/Q mismatching.

**Peripheral ECMO**:
- Select candidates according to RespScore (VV) or SAVEScore (V/A).

### Early Management of ARDS in 2019

#### Initial Management
- **Initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation with sedation in ICU**:
  - Tidal volume (Vt) about 6 ml/kg of PBW in the absence of severe metabolic acidosis.
  - Systematic screening for ARDS diagnosis criteria.

#### ARDS Diagnosis Criteria
- **PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg**
- **PEEP ≥ 5 cmH2O**
- **Bilateral opacities on chest imaging**
- **Not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload**
- **Within a week of a known clinical insult**

#### Confirmed ARDS
- Tidal volume about 6 ml/kg of PBW.
- Plateau pressure < 30 cmH2O.
- PEEP > 5 cmH2O.
- Check for hypercapnia.

#### ARDS Severity and Management Strategy
1. **P/F < 200**:
   - High level of PEEP if it improves oxygenation.
2. **P/F < 150**:
   - Neuromuscular blockers.
   - Prone positioning.
3. **P/F < 80**:
   - Discuss VV-ECMO.

#### Prone Positioning
- Applied for >16h a day, for several consecutive days.

#### Neuromuscular Blockers
- Continuous intravenous infusion.
- Early initiation (within the first 48h of ARDS diagnosis).

#### VV-ECMO
- In case of refractory hypoxemia or when protective ventilation cannot be applied.
- To be discussed with experienced ECMO centers.

#### Potential Additional Therapies
- **Inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO)**: When severe hypoxemia persists despite prone positioning and before considering VV-ECMO.
- **Partial Ventilation Support**: After the early phase to generate tidal volume about 6 ml/kg and less than 8 ml/kg.

#### Not Recommended
- **ECCO2R**
- **Driving pressure**
- **Partial ventilation support at the early phase**

#### Should Probably Not Be Done
- Systematic recruitment maneuvers.

#### Should Not Be Done
- High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (HFOV).
# How Does Proning Help?

## Prone
- Moves the heart anteriorly, unloads the diaphragm, and clears secretions.
- Reduces ventral dorsal pulmonary gradient and creates a more favorable chest wall shape.

### Benefits
1. **Improved Oxygenation**:
   - More aerated lung (less of a baby lung).

2. **Protection Against VILI**:
   - Larger and more homogeneous lung ventilation (more lung to ventilate).

3. **Reduced Rates of Infection**:
4. **Reduced Shunting**:

### PROSEVA Trial
- **Study**: Guerin et al., 2013.
- **Outcome**: Marked mortality benefit (NNT = 6) for prone ventilation in severe ARDS.
- **Results**: 28-day mortality 16% prone vs. 32.8% supine.

## PEEP

### Pressure-Volume Curves
- **Upper Inflection Point (UIP)**: Overdistention of alveoli and compression of blood vessels leading to shunting.
- **Lower Inflection Point (LIP)**: Collapse of alveoli leading to shunting.

### Ventilator Settings and Management Strategy Reassessment
- **Reassessment**: Reassess ventilator settings and management strategy at least every 24h.

### Pressure-Volume Relationship in Mechanical Ventilation

#### Key Points
- **Lower Inflection Point (LIP)**: Minimum pressure required for alveolar recruitment.
- **Upper Inflection Point (UIP)**: Pressure at which there is regional overdistension.
- **Optimal Compliance**: Between LIP and UIP.
- **Tidal Volume (TV)**: Adjust to stay below UIP to avoid overdistension.
- **PEEP**: Adjust to stay above LIP to maintain alveolar recruitment.

## Cardiovascular Effects of PEEP

1. **RV Preload**: Decreased due to decreased venous return caused by increased intrathoracic pressure.
2. **RV Afterload**: Increased due to overinflation of alveoli.
3. **LV Preload**: Decreased due to decreased RV preload leading to decreased RV stroke volume.
4. **LV Afterload**: Decreased due to increased transmural pressure.
5. **Ventricular Interdependence**: Occurs when increased RVEDV causes the intraventricular septum to bulge into the LV, reducing LV filling. During spontaneous inspiration, with PEEP, the IVS shifts towards the RV due to decreased RV filling, reducing ventricular interdependence.

## Optimizing PEEP

### Performing a Recruitment Maneuver

1. **Initial Settings**:
   - Place the patient in pressure-control ventilation, FiO2: 1.0.
   - Set pressure control level: 15 cm H2O.
   - Set inspiratory time: 3 s, rate: 10/min.

2. **Procedure**:
   - Increase positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) by 3–5 cm H2O every five breaths until the maximum peak airway pressure (PIP) is achieved.
   - Maximum applied PEEP: 25-35 cm H2O, depending upon the targeted maximum PIP.

3. **Maximum PIP**:
   - Maximum PIP is between 40 and 50 cm H2O based on patient hemodynamic stability.
   - Once at maximum PIP, continue to ventilate for 1 min.

4. **Post-Recruitment**:
   - Perform a decremental PEEP trial or set PEEP to ensure a positive end expiratory transpulmonary pressure.

### Performing a Decremental Best Compliance Positive End Expiratory Pressure Trial

1. **Initial Settings**:
   - Ventilate in volume control ventilation (VCV).
   - Set PEEP at 20–25 cm H2O dependent on patient severity of lung injury.
   - Set tidal volume (Vt): 4–6 mL/kg PBW.
   - Set flow to allow normal inspiratory time (0.6–0.8 s).
   - Adjust respiratory rate to a rate that does not result in the development of autoPEEP (20–30 breaths/min).

2. **Compliance Measurement**:
   - Measure dynamic compliance (it only takes 30–45 s for compliance to stabilize once PEEP is set).
   - Decrease PEEP by 2 cm H2O; reassess dynamic compliance.

3. **Decremental PEEP Trial**:
   - Continue to decrease PEEP by 2 cm H2O reassessing dynamic compliance until a clear pattern indicates the best compliance PEEP.
   - Initially, compliance will increase as PEEP is decreased, but as the lung begins to derecruit, compliance will decrease. Once it is obvious that compliance is decreasing, the decremental trial can be stopped.

4. **Setting Optimal PEEP**:
   - Recruit the lung and set PEEP at the best compliance decremental PEEP plus 2 cm H2O.
   - The best compliance decremental PEEP underestimates the best oxygenation decremental PEEP by about 2 cm H2O.

## Trials that Have Influenced Management

### ARDSNET and ARMA
- **VT of 6 ml/kg vs. 10 ml/kg**:
  - Trial stopped early due to mortality (39% vs. 31%) in large lung volumes.
  - Large Vt contributes to alveolar stretching and more inflammatory processes.
  - Less interleukin-6 detected.

### LUNGSAFE
- **Findings**:
  - ARDS accounts for 10% of ICU admissions and 23% of ventilated patients.
  - Mortality rate: 40%.

### OSCAR/HFOV
- **Outcome**:
  - No difference in mortality.

### OSCILLATE/HFOV
- **Outcome**:
  - Stopped early due to worse mortality in HFOV vs. pressure control (47% vs. 35%).

### ACURASYS
- **Outcome**:
  - Improved 90-day mortality with NMB (cis-atracurium).
  - Likely due to better patient synchrony and reduced oxygen consumption by the diaphragm.

### PROSEVA
- **Outcome**:
  - Proning in severe ARDS patients reduced 28-day and 90-day mortality.

### CESAR
- **Outcome**:
  - Better outcomes in ECMO patients compared to conventional treatment in severe ARDS.

# Anaesthesia and ARDS

## Goals for Anaesthesiologists
1. Provide optimal ventilation and anaesthesia without compromising the cardiovascular system.
2. Use lung protective ventilation strategies to limit inflammatory processes.
3. Avoid unnecessary intravenous fluids to prevent extravascular lung water accumulation.
4. Promote recovery and postoperative mobilisation.

## Preoperative Management

### Identification of General Risk Factors for Developing ARDS

#### Direct Risk Factors
- Pneumonia
- Aspiration of gastric contents
- Inhalational injury
- Pulmonary contusion
- Pulmonary vasculitis
- Drowning

#### Indirect Risk Factors
- Non-pulmonary sepsis
- Major trauma
- Pancreatitis
- Severe burns
- Non-cardiogenic shock
- Drug overdose
- Multiple transfusions or TRALI

### Risk Prediction Scores for ARDS

#### SLIP-2 Model
- **Predictors**:
  - Sepsis
  - High-risk aortic vascular surgery
  - High-risk cardiac surgery
  - Emergency surgery
  - Cirrhosis
  - Admission location other than home
  - Increased respiratory rate (20-29 and >30 breaths/min)
  - FiO2 greater than 0.35
  - SpO2 less than 95%
- **Purpose**: Predicts patients at risk of developing early postoperative lung injury.

#### Other Models
- **Lung Injury Prediction (LIP) Score**: Initially developed for all patients and validated in surgical critical care patients.
- **Early Oxygen Saturation to FiO2 Ratio**: Shown to be an independent indicator of ARDS development in at-risk patients.

### Optimization Strategies
1. Early recognition and treatment of respiratory infections, including identification of causative pathogens.
2. Use bedside lung ultrasound to offer additional diagnostic information and differentiate ARDS from cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.
3. Employ routine approaches to reduce gastric aspiration and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

## Intraoperative Management

### Respiratory Consequences of General Anaesthesia
1. Basal atelectasis due to positioning, high inspired FiO2, and reduced functional residual capacity.
2. Loss of muscle tone and decreased negative pressure lung expansion.
3. Decreased minute ventilation.
4. Closing capacity nearing functional residual capacity.
5. Volatile anaesthetic-induced inhibition of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to increased intrapulmonary shunting.
6. Increased alveolar dead space ventilation due to atelectasis and perfusion alterations.
7. Blunted responses to hypercarbia.

### Ventilation Strategies

#### Mechanical Forces
- Mechanical forces from positive pressure ventilation contribute to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and ARDS.
- Focus on limiting stretching, strain, and biotrauma at the interfaces between normal and diseased lung units.

#### Driving Pressure and Mechanical Power
- **Driving Pressure**: Plateau pressure minus PEEP. Aim to reduce energy transfer and improve outcomes.
- **Mechanical Power**: Unifies multiple ventilator-related causes of lung injury into a single variable. Higher power increases the likelihood of VILI.

#### FiO2
- Target SpO2 between 88-95%.
- Research needed on lung toxicity from high FiO2 and neurocognitive outcomes from normoxaemia targeting.

#### Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)
- Select PEEP to maintain open alveolar units, avoiding repeated opening/closing and minimising shear forces and biotrauma.
- Apply PEEP of 10 cmH2O at the start of ventilation.

#### Tidal Volumes (TV)
- Use low tidal volumes (6-8 ml/kg ideal body weight) to reduce shear stress and improve outcomes.
- Measure and control driving pressure: TV of 4-5 ml/kg for one-lung ventilation.
- Allow permissive hypercapnia if ventilator targets cannot normalise paCO2, except in cases of raised intracranial pressure or severe right heart failure.

#### Mode of Ventilation
- Mode does not significantly influence ARDS outcomes.

#### Recruitment Manoeuvres
- Controversial, may not be routine in severe ARDS.
- Avoid unnecessary attempts to expand lung units to prevent worsening biotrauma and atelectrauma.
- Individualised practice recommended.

### Fluid and Blood Management
- Avoid excess intravenous fluids to prevent hypoxaemia from extravascular lung water.
- Use dynamic markers of fluid responsiveness for assessment.
- Restrictive transfusion strategy (trigger Hb 7 g/dL, target Hb > 7 g/dL) to minimise ARDS risk.
- Be cautious with plasma-containing blood products to prevent transfusion-related acute lung injury.

### Choice of Anaesthesia
#### Inhalational Anaesthetics
- Protect against ischaemic-reperfusion injury.
- Benefits include endothelial glycocalyx protection, ischaemic pre-conditioning, and immune-modulating effects.
- Volatile anaesthetics inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction but have potential advantages.
- Intravenous agents, such as propofol, may worsen endothelial function in overdose.

#### General Anaesthesia
- Suitable for most ARDS patients to manage PEEP and TV.
- Combined general anaesthetic and neuraxial technique for postoperative analgesia may decrease postoperative pneumonia and respiratory failure.

### Haemodynamics
- Right heart dysfunction may result from pulmonary arterial hypertension due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.
- Ensure euvolaemia without excessive IV fluids.
- Manage the systemic inflammatory response to prevent cardiovascular failure.

## Summary

Anaesthesiologists play a critical role in managing ARDS, focusing on optimal ventilation strategies, careful fluid management, and maintaining haemodynamic stability. Preoperative risk assessment, intraoperative ventilation strategies, and fluid management are essential to minimize complications and promote recovery in ARDS patients.

| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Corticosteroids**                                       | Identification of 21 microRNA has suggested steroid-sensitive and steroid-independent mechanisms in the development of ARDS. This may account for different responses to the use of corticosteroids in previous studies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Inhaled vasodilators**                                  | Nitric oxide has vasodilatory effects on pulmonary vasculature and improves arterial oxygenation, but its use has not demonstrated mortality or significant outcome benefits. Its use is complicated by high costs and increased renal dysfunction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Muscle relaxants**                                      | Short-term use of muscle relaxation (up to 48h) for patients with severe ARDS may reduce mortality risk and reduce ventilator-associated lung injury. This may be mediated by reducing transpulmonary pressures during mechanical ventilation and reducing oxygen consumption, but this strategy requires further investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **ECMO**                                                  | ECMO has shown promising results in uncontrolled reports of its use in the management of severe ARDS. The role of this expensive therapy in ARDS treatment and in the transport of those with severe ARDS requires further investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Aspirin                                                 | Aspirin may have positive effects on platelets that play an active role in the development of ARDS. The Lung Injury Prevention Study with Aspirin, a phase II trial, did not show any outcome benefit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Aerosolised beta-2-agonists**                           | These agents have previously been effective in reducing pulmonary oedema by stimulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent alveolar fluid clearance. Initial studies demonstrated harm in patients with ARDS. However, a recent study showed favourable results with inhaled budesonide and formoterol. Patients had improved oxygenation, lower rates of acute respiratory failure and ARDS This therapy appears promising.                                                                                |
| **Keratinocyte growth factor and mesenchymal stem cells** | Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is expressed by mesenchymal cells and appears to promote cell repair via several mechanisms including stimulating type-2 pneumocyte development, increased surfactant production, DNA repair, and improved alveolar fluid clearance. The effects of KGF may explain the possible benefits of mesenchymal stem cells in ARDS. Researchers are currently investigating the role of intravenous KGF in patients with ARDS, and the immunomodulating role of mesenchymal stem cells. |
| **Surfactant**                                            | Surfactant inhibition and degradation is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of ARDS. Although successful in neonates and infants, multiple large trials in adults failed to show improved clinical outcomes, despite reports of transient improvements in oxygenation and lung function. There is a continued search for a better exogenous surfactant replacement therapy.                                                                                                                             |
| **Beta-blockers**                                         | The theoretical benefit of beta-blockers in ARDS involves suppression of the overstimulated sympathetic response that may negatively affect pulmonary vasculature. Some benefit has been demonstrated in a porcine endotoxin shock model; however, further RCTs are required to understand benefit.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
