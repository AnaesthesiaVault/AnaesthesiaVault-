# Introduction

## Features of Bacterial Cells

Prokaryotic cells differ significantly from eukaryotic cells, enabling antibiotics to target unique bacterial structures without affecting human cells.

### Components of Bacterial Cells

- **Cytoplasm:** An amorphous mixture surrounding the nucleoid and enclosed by the cell wall.
- **Ribosomes:** Includes 30S, 50S, and 70S subunits; essential for protein synthesis.
- **Nucleoid:** Single chromosome folded by DNA gyrase and Topoisomerase IV.
- **Plasmid:** Double-stranded DNA that replicates independently.
- **Transposons:** DNA fragments that can be transported between bacterial cells.
- **Cell Wall:** A rigid envelope that includes an outer capsule contributing to virulence and adherence. The peptidoglycan layer, formed by Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs), distinguishes between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
  - *Gram-Positive Cell Wall:* Stains purple; thick peptidoglycan layer with teichoic acid.
  - *Gram-Negative Cell Wall:* Stains pink; thin peptidoglycan layer with complex cell wall structures, including porins and lipopolysaccharides (endotoxin A).

## Types of Antibiotics

- **Beta-lactams:** Penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems.
- **Glycopeptides:**
  - *Vancomycin:* SE: redman syndrome, nephrotoxicity, thrombocytopenia.
  - *Teicoplanin:* Better tolerated, no need to monitor blood levels.
- **Aminoglycosides:** Gentamycin and amikacin; nephrotoxic and ototoxic.
- **Macrolides:** Erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin; broad-spectrum and effective against atypicals.
- **Clindamycin:** Broad spectrum, penetrates bone well.
- **Tetracyclines:** Broad spectrum.
- **Quinolones:** Ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin; contraindicated in epileptics.
- **Imidazole Derivative:** Metronidazole; effective against anaerobes.
- **Polymixins:** Colistin.
- **Chloramphenicol:** Causes bone marrow suppression.

# Principles of Antibiotic Dosing
## Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)

The minimum concentration of an antibiotic required to inhibit the growth of bacteria. A lower MIC indicates a more potent antibiotic. It is essential to maintain antibiotic levels above the MIC to ensure efficacy.

## Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC)

The minimum concentration of an antibiotic required to kill 99.9% of the bacteria.

- **Bactericidal Agents:** MBC is significantly higher than MIC, often four times greater.
- **Bacteriostatic Agents:** MBC is equal to or close to MIC.
### Examples

- **ECSTaTiC (Mnemonic for Bacteriostatic Agents)**
	
	- Erythromycin
	- Clindamycin
	- Sulphonamides
	- Tetracyclines
	- Trimethoprim
	- Chloramphenicol
- **Very Proficient At Cell Murder (Mnemonic for Bactericidal Agents)**
	
	- Vancomycin
	- Penicillins
	- Aminoglycosides
	- Ciprofloxacin + Cephalosporins
	- Metronidazole
## Concentration Vs time Dependant Killing

**Type I: Concentration-dependent killing and prolonged persistent effects**

- **Antibiotics**: Aminoglycosides, Daptomycin, Fluoroquinolones, Ketolides
- **Goal of Therapy**: Maximize concentrations
- **PK/PD Parameter**: Peak/MIC
- **Strategy**: Aim ratio > 8-10 to prevent resistance

**Type II: Time-dependent killing and minimal persistent effects**

- **Antibiotics**: Carbapenems, Cephalosporins, Erythromycin, Linezolid, Penicillins
- **Goal of Therapy**: Maximize duration of exposure
- **PK/PD Parameter**: T>MIC
- **Strategy**: Aim for time above MIC to be > 50-70% above the dosing interval

**Type III: Time-dependent killing and moderate to prolonged persistent effects**

- **Antibiotics**: Azithromycin, Clindamycin, Oxazolidinones, Tetracyclines, Vancomycin
- **Goal of Therapy**: Maximize amount of drug
- **PK/PD Parameter**: 24h-AUC/MIC
- **Strategy**: Ratio depends on the drug (e.g., 400 for vancomycin)

### Time Dependent Killing

![](Pasted%20image%2020240131131833.png)

#### Efficiency and Dosing Considerations

- **Time Above MIC:**
  - Efficiency is determined by the time spent above MIC.
  - Typically, more than 50% of the time above MIC is considered adequate for effective treatment.
  
- **Effective Concentration:**
  - Only effective when the concentration is four times the MIC for bactericidal agents.
  
- **Post-Antibiotic Effect (PAE):**
  - Generally, beta-lactams and carbapenems do not have a PAE, except for carbapenems.
  - The PAE is the continued suppression of bacterial growth after limited exposure to an antibiotic.
  - PAE can vary: absent (e.g., macrolides), minimal (e.g., beta-lactams, including penicillins and penems), or moderate (e.g., glycopeptides, linezolid).
- **Administration Method:**
  - Antibiotics are often given most effectively as infusions to maintain steady drug levels.
  
- **Examples of Time-Dependent Antibiotics:**
  - Beta-lactams
  - Carbapenems
  
- **Effective Dose Determination:**
  - Determined by the time the drug concentration remains above the MIC.
### Concentration Dependant Killing

![](Pasted%20image%2020240131131524.png)

- **Peak Concentration:**
	- A larger dose is given to reach peak concentration, usually 10x MIC.
	- As concentration drops below MIC, bacteria are still stunned and continue to be destroyed by the host immune defense (PAE).
- **Timing of Doses:**
	- Although concentration is crucial, the timing of subsequent doses is important to prevent bacterial replication.
- **Examples:**
	- Aminoglycosides
	- Fluoroquinolones
- **Effective Dose Determination:**
	- Determined by the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) to MIC, typically 100-125.

## Common Doses in ICU

- **Gentamycin:** 7 - 9 mg/kg daily
- **Amikacin:** 25 - 30 mg/kg daily
- **Colistin:**
	- Loading dose: 9 - 12 mU
	- Maintenance dose: 3 mU every 8 hours or 4.5 mU every 12 hours
- **Piptaz (Piperacillin/Tazobactam):** 4.5 g every 6 hours
- **Cloxacillin:** 2 g every 6 hours
- **Meropenem:** 1-2 g every 6-8 hours
- **Ertapenem:** 1 g every 12 hours
# Antibiotics Dosing in Special Circumstances

## Factors Influencing Pharmacokinetics (PK) in Critically Ill Patients

## Sepsis

Septic patients have circulating endotoxins and exotoxins which damage capillaries and cause capillary leak. This causes fluid to shift from the intravascular space to the interstitial space, taking with it hydrophilic molecules (importantly, antibiotics) which hugely increases their Vd and therefore reduces the serum concentration of the hydrophilic antimicrobials. Additionally, vasodilation and hypotension frequently require fluid resuscitation which, over hours, further expands the interstitium and further increases the Vd. It is important to recognize that the increase in Vd is only of relevance for hydrophilic antibiotics (the majority of antibiotics used in clinical practice), and not those which are lipophilic.

### Process
- Endotoxins and exotoxins damage endothelium
- Capillary leak
- Fluid shift from intravascular to interstitial space
- Increased V<sub>d</sub> of hydrophilic antibiotics
- Reduction in concentration of hydrophilic antibiotics

#### Contributing Factors
- Fluid resuscitation expands interstitium
- Hyperdynamic state and increased CO
- Diminished microvascular perfusion
- Hypalbuminaemia
  - Increased unbound fraction

#### Renal Clearance

- Increased renal clearance especially in sepsis
- Increased renal blood flow
- Increased clearance of renally eliminated drugs especially in sepsis

#### Outcome

- Antimicrobial failure with normal doses of antibiotics due to above factors especially increased renal clearance and renally cleared drugs

### Dosing Considerations in Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

- **Hydrophilic Antimicrobials:** Do not reduce initial doses, especially in the first 48 hours due to increased volume of distribution (Vd).
- **Increased Renal Clearance:** Patients with sepsis, young age, burns, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or those who are mechanically ventilated may require higher concentrations due to augmented renal clearance (>130 mL/min).

### Challenges and Risks of Underdosing

- **Underdosing in Sepsis:**
  - The literature indicates that underdosing antimicrobials is far more common than overdosing.
  - Underdosing can lead to:
	- Inefficient antimicrobial killing
	- Compromised clinical outcomes
	- Development of multi-drug resistant organisms
  
- **Hydrophilic Antibiotics:**
  - Common in clinical practice (e.g., ÃŸ-lactams, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides).
  - Prone to failure in septic patients due to increased volume of distribution and renal clearance.
  
- **Lipophilic Antibiotics:**
  - Examples: Fluoroquinolones and macrolides.
  - Easier dosing in septic patients due to intracellular accumulation and hepatic clearance.
  - Require dose adjustment only in severe hepatic failure.
