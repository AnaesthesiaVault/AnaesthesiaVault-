# Electrolyte Management in ICU

## Identify Immediately Life-Threatening Electrolyte Abnormalities
- **Consider causes and ongoing causative factors needing management**
### Replace Potentially Significant Deficits of Critical Ions
- **K<sup>+</sup> < 3.5 mmol/L**
  - Risk: Arrhythmia
- **Mg<sup>2+</sup> < 0.8 mmol/L**
  - Risk: Arrhythmia
- **PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> < 0.7 mmol/L**
  - Risk: Respiratory muscle weakness
- **Na<sup>+</sup> < 125 mmol/L**
  - Risk: Cerebral dysfunction
- **Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ionized) < 0.8 mmol/L**
  - Risk: Hypotension
### Manage Potentially Significant Elevations of Critical Ions
- **K<sup>+</sup> > 5.5 mmol/L with ECG changes**
- **Na<sup>+</sup> > 160 mmol/L**
- **Cl<sup>-</sup> > 130 mmol/L**
- **PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> > 2.5 mmol/L**
- **Mg<sup>2+</sup> > 4.0 mmol/L**
## Consider Fluid-Conservative Methods of Intravenous Replacement for Deficits

### Pure K<sup>+</sup> Replacement
- **Dosage:**
  - 80 meq (40 mL) 15% KCl in a total volume of 200 mL (mix with 160 mL of either 0.9% NaCl or D5W) over 4 hours (50 mL/hr)
  - _ONLY THROUGH CENTRAL LINE VIA INFUSION PUMP_
  - Maximum rate of replacement = 20 meq K<sup>+</sup> per hour
### Pure Mg<sup>2+</sup> Replacement
- **Dosage:**
  - 4g MgSO<sub>4</sub> in 50 mL total volume (mix with 42 mL 0.9% NaCl or D5W in buretrol) over 15 minutes
### K<sup>+</sup> & Mg<sup>2+</sup> Replacement
- **Dosage:**
  - 80 meq (40 mL) 15% KCl + 4g MgSO<sub>4</sub> in a total volume of 200 mL (mix with 152 mL of either 0.9% NaCl or D5W) over 4 hours (50 mL/hr)
  - _ONLY THROUGH CENTRAL LINE VIA INFUSION PUMP_
### Pure PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> Replacement
- **Dosage:**
  - 40 meq (20 mL) KPO<sub>4</sub> in a total volume of 200 mL (mix with 180 mL of either 0.9% NaCl or D5W) over 4 hours (50 mL/hr)
  - _ONLY THROUGH CENTRAL LINE VIA INFUSION PUMP_
  - _Never give more than 10 meq KPO<sub>4</sub> per hour_–Risk of hypocalcemia
### K<sup>+</sup> & PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> Replacement
- **Dosage:**
  - 40 meq (20 mL) KPO<sub>4</sub> + 40 meq (20 mL) 15% KCl in a total volume of 200 mL (mix with 160 mL of either 0.9% NaCl or D5W) over 4 hours (50 mL/hr)
  - _ONLY THROUGH CENTRAL LINE VIA INFUSION PUMP_
  - Infusion rate limitations of both K<sup>+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> apply
### Mixing Guidelines
- **DO NOT MIX** MgSO<sub>4</sub> with KPO<sub>4</sub> in the same bag.
### Non-Emergent Ca<sup>2+</sup> Replacement for Low Ionized Calcium without Emergent Symptoms
- **Dosage:**
  - 10 mL 10% Calcium gluconate in 50 mL total volume (mix with 40 mL 0.9% NaCl or D5W in buretrol) over 10 minutes
  - Re-evaluate ionized Ca<sup>2+</sup> 10 minutes after infusion
  - Avoiding stopping for arrhythmias during infusion
### Hyponatremia
- **Defined as:** Na<sup>+</sup> < 135 mmol/L
- **Correction:**
  - Specific correction only required for Na<sup>+</sup> < 120 mmol/L with neurological symptoms
  - Correct at no more than 1 mmol/L/hr to 120 mmol/L using 0.9% NaCl if patient is intravascularly volume depleted
  - Hypertonic saline if patient is intravascularly replete or overloaded–Consult specific guidelines for dosage calculation
## Hypernatremia
- **Severity:**
  - Likely requires active management when > 155 mmol/L
- **Management:**
  - Decide on patient's fluid volume status as this will influence the choice of corrective management
  - Fluid overload + hypernatremia suggests total body sodium overload (e.g., iatrogenic administration)
  - Fluid underload + hypernatremia suggests dehydration and hence concentration of sodium
## Hyperkalemia
- **Factors Influencing Urgency of Treatment:**
  - Acute (less than 2 days) or chronic?
  - Associated with ECG changes?
	- _Acute hyperkalemia with ECG changes warrants urgent therapy_
- **Likely Cause:**
  - Increased intake? (Often iatrogenic)
  - Decreased elimination from body (renal failure commonly)
  - Normal total body potassium but intracellular → extracellular shift (e.g., acute acidosis)
- **Management:**
  - **Elimination of Excess K<sup>+</sup> from the Body:**
	- Dialysis [fast] / Diuresis / "Kayexalate" [slow]
  - **Shifting K<sup>+</sup> Extracellularly → Intracellularly:**
	- Dextrose + Insulin
	- Beta<sub>2</sub> agonists
	  - Inhaled
	  - Intravenous
  - **Antagonizing K<sup>+</sup> Effect on Myocardium:**
	- Broad QRS: Controlled Calcium gluconate infusion
	- Hyperkalemic cardiac arrest: Calc<sub>2</sub> 1000 mg IVI stat
## Hyperchloremia
- **Often iatrogenic, may contribute to metabolic acidosis.**
# Fluid Management in ICU

## Post-Resuscitation Fluid Strategy
- **Appropriate Fluid Strategy:**
  - Excessive fluids may be as lethal as inadequate fluids (just on a longer timescale).
## Haemodynamic Stability
- **Haemodynamic Unstability:**
  - Ensure intravascular volume deficit is identified and corrected aggressively as described in "Circulation" above.
## Diabetic Emergency
- Manage according to diabetic emergencies protocols.
## Fluid Infusion Planning Post-Stabilization
- **Maintenance Requirements:**
  - Fluids
  - Electrolytes and nutrition
- **Fluid Requirement Phases:**
  - **Resuscitation:**
	- Still unstable with ongoing absolute/relative intravascular hypovolaemia, or need for active fluid replacement.
	- Expect need to augment Total Body Water.
	- A positive fluid balance is expected.
  - **Plateau:**
	- Inflammatory response has settled; no additional fluids needed.
	- Fluid administration should match baseline maintenance.
	- Keep Total Body Water at current level.
	- A daily neutral fluid balance is desired.
  - **De-Resuscitation:**
	- Patient is recuperating; Total Body Water is greater-than-healthy-baseline.
	- Fluids need elimination to return the patient to pre-illness levels.
	- A daily negative fluid balance is desired.
## Resuscitation Phase Considerations
- **Rehydrating Dehydrated Tissues:**
  - Blood losses?
  - Plasma losses (e.g., open abdomen suction, open wounds seeping into dressings)?
  - Abnormal nasogastric losses?
  - Other abnormal GIT losses?
  - Inappropriate urine losses (e.g., polyuric renal failure with tubule dysfunction)?
- **Unquantifiable Ongoing Losses:**
  - "Capillary leak" (endothelial and glycocalyx malfunction) in inflammatory states with sequestration into tissues.
  - Mechanisms to detect "fallen behind" and the need for bolus fluids.
  - Mechanisms to detect fluid overload.
  - Balance of vasopressors and fluids in inflammatory states.
## Plateau Phase Considerations
- **Markers to Confirm Plateau Phase:**
  - Limits of allowable positivity or negativity of fluid balance before active management is required.
  - Managing fluid administration to meet nutritional goals without exceeding fluid limit.
## De-Resuscitation Phase Considerations
- **Spontaneous De-Resuscitation:**
  - Need for assisted de-resuscitation?
  - Issues: Tissue oedema? Lung compliance? Oxygenation issues? Gut oedema?
- **Assisted De-Resuscitation:**
  - Best route: Dialysis? Diuresis?
	- **Furosemide Boluses:**
	  - Regular?
	  - P.R.N.?
	- **Furosemide Infusion:**
	  - Furosemide infusion + acetazolamide to control contraction alkalosis.
- **Achievable Negative Fluid Balance:**
  - Is it being achieved? Does the de-resuscitation plan need augmentation?
## Default Baseline Fluid Volume
- **Adults:** 1 mL/kg (actual mass) per hour.
  - Includes all medications, infusions, feeds.
  - Adjust for bolus medications:
	- 200 mL of antibiotics given 8 hourly = 25 mL/hr.
  - Adjust for feed volume increases:
	- By de-resuscitation phase, only nutrition and dissolution volumes required.
## Post-Admission Intravenous Fluids
- **Crystalloids:**
  - Colloid fluids should only be used for bolus replacement of acute identified intravascular volume deficit and never be given by infusion.
- **Phases:**
  - **Resuscitation Phase (Haemodynamically Unstable):**
	- **Head Injury Moderate/Severe:**
	  - Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl)
	- **No Head Injury:**
	  - Ringer's Lactate or equivalent
  - **Resuscitation Phase (No Longer Haemodynamically Unstable but Replacing Losses or Rehydrating Tissues):**
	- **Head Injury Moderate/Severe:**
	  - Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl) unless Na<sup>+</sup> > 145 mmol/L or Cl<sup>-</sup> > 115 mmol/L
	- **Plasma-like Losses:**
	  - Ringer's Lactate or equivalent
	- **Rehydration of Tissues/Polyuria Losses/Some NG Losses:**
	  - 0.45% NaCl but check U&E frequently and adapt.
  - **Plateau Phase (Non-Head Injury):**
	- 0.45% NaCl + 5% Dextrose ("Rehydration Solution")
	  - _NB: Has no K<sup>+</sup>_
	- 5% Mainteyte
	  - Not if plasma Na<sup>+</sup> < 125 mmol/L or K<sup>+</sup> > 5.0 mmol/L.
- **Fluid Rate Limits:**
  - Do not exceed 1.5 mL/kg/hr.
  - If more is needed, patient is not in Plateau phase.
  - Dextrose-containing fluids exceeding 1.5 mL/kg/hr may cause uncontrolled hyperglycaemia.
- **Special Cases:**
  - Elevated intracranial pressure: Avoid hypotonic fluids; consult with reference to U&E.
- **Fluid Choice Adjustment:**
  - Re-evaluate and adjust frequently based on trends in U&E and clinical evaluation.
## Feed Volume and Baseline Fluid Volume
- **Feed Volume Increases:**
  - By de-resuscitation phase, only nutrition and dissolution volumes needed.
- **Elevated Baseline Infusion of Crystalloids:**
  - Convenient for tissue rehydration or ongoing losses.
  - Set formal target for total fluids (e.g., 1.5/2/3 mL/kg/hr) based on clinical judgment.
  - Subtract volumes of given medication, infusions, feeds.
  - Administer appropriate colloid as needed to "make up the difference".
  - Avoid glucose-containing fluids for elevated rate infusions.
- **Review Baseline Infusion:**
  - At least every 4 hours to avoid overload.
## Quantifiable Ongoing Losses
- **Replacing Ongoing Losses:**
  - Loss rates can change; aim low in setting replacement fluid rates.
  - Replacement rate (4-hourly) advised.
  - "Top-up boluses" as needed.
## Large Volume Fluid Infusion
- **Haematological Effects:**
  - Dilutional anaemia?
  - Dilutional coagulopathy?
  - Abnormal fluid losses due to endothelial-glycocalyx function impairment, sequestration into tissues.
  - Consideration of "non-leakable" packed red blood cells.
# Blood Management in ICU

 Ensure Adequate Haemoglobin to Allow Adequate DO<sub>2</sub>

 Haemoglobin (Hb) Target According to Patient Condition

## Hb = 10 g/dL
- **Indications:**
  - Acutely shocked, especially septic shock with evidence of tissue hypoperfusion.
  - Acute coronary syndromes.
  - Strong history of ischaemic heart disease.
  - Post free flap.
  - Other identified ischaemic tissue.
## Hb = 8.5 g/dL
- **Indications:**
  - Not shocked, but ongoing significant blood loss likely.
  - Ongoing fluid or inotrope/vasopressor infusions required to maintain haemodynamic stabilization.
  - Elderly/frail/malnourished patients with ongoing organ dysfunction.
  - Patient symptomatically anaemic at Hb 7.0 g/dL.
## Hb = 7.0 g/dL
- **Indications:**
  - Haemodynamically stable: no inotrope/vasopressor requirements.
  - No ongoing blood loss/expected blood loss.
	- Includes controlled upper GIT bleed.
  - Not symptomatically anaemic, no evidence of organ dysfunction.
## Note
- **Transfused Blood:**
  - May not be fully functional for oxygen carriage for up to 24 hours post-administration.
  - **Risks:**
	- May not leak from vessels in severe endothelial-glycocalyx dysfunction.
	- May increase blood viscosity, leading to greater endothelial stimulation, increased vasoconstrictive endothelin production, and increased vascular tone in vasodilated patients who are also anaemic.

## Intracellular Fluid

- **Sodium-Potassium Pump**: A membrane-bound adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–dependent pump exchanges Na⁺ for K⁺ in a 3:2 ratio.
- **Ion Concentration**: Cell membranes are relatively impermeable to sodium and, to a lesser extent, potassium ions. Thus, potassium is concentrated intracellularly, whereas sodium is concentrated extracellularly.
- **Osmotic Pressure**:
  - Potassium is the most important determinant of intracellular osmotic pressure.
  - Sodium is the most important determinant of extracellular osmotic pressure.
- **Protein Impermeability**: The impermeability of cell membranes to most proteins results in a high intracellular protein concentration. Proteins act as non-diffusible solutes (anions), and the unequal exchange ratio of 3 Na⁺ for 2 K⁺ by the cell membrane pump prevents relative intracellular hyperosmolality.
- **Cell Swelling**: Interference with Na⁺–K⁺-ATPase activity, as occurs during ischemia or hypoxia, results in progressive swelling of cells.
## Extracellular Fluid

- **Primary Function**: The principal function of extracellular fluid (ECF) is to provide a medium for the delivery of cell nutrients and electrolytes and the removal of cellular waste products.
- **Sodium's Role**:
  - Sodium is the most important extracellular cation.
  - It is the major determinant of extracellular osmotic pressure and volume.
  - Changes in ECF volume are therefore related to changes in total body sodium content.

## Sodium
### Hypernatremia

#### Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240312131256.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020240129140218.png)

#### Correction of Hypernatremia (Total Body Water Deficit)
##### Calculation Steps

1. **Normal Total Body Water (TBW)**
Normal TBW = 0.6X weight (kg) (0.5 in female)
2. **Present TBW (with high sodium)**
Present TBW = (Normal TBW x 140)/Patient's current sodium
3. **Water Deficit**
  Water Deficit = Normal TBW - Present TBW
4. **Fluid Replacement Rate**
   - Replace the calculated water deficit over 48 hours.
   - Convert the water deficit to milliliters per hour.
#### Example Calculation

For a 70 kg male patient with a sodium level of 160 mmol/L:

1. **Normal TBW**: \(0.6 \times 70 = 42 \) liters.
2. **Present TBW**: (42x 140)/160 = 36.75 liters.
3. **Water Deficit**: (42 - 36.75) = 5.25 liters.
4. **Fluid Replacement Rate**: 5250/ 48 hours= 109.375ml/hour
#### Anaesthesia Considerations for Hypernatremia

##### Elective Surgeries
- **Postpone Surgery**: If sodium > 150-155 mmol/L.
- **Identify Cause**: Aim to find the underlying cause of hypernatremia.
- **Fluid Replacement**: Correct the fluid deficit before proceeding with elective surgery.
##### Emergency Surgeries
- **Frequent Sodium Measurements**: Monitor sodium levels frequently during the procedure.
- **Invasive Blood Pressure Monitoring**: Necessary due to the likelihood of hypovolemia.
- **Adjusted Medication Doses**: Reduced volume of distribution requires reduced doses of IV induction agents.
### Hyponatremia

#### Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314135054.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314134955.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020240129140041.png)

#### Anaesthesia Considerations

- **Manifestation of Serious Underlying Disorder**: Hyponatremia can indicate a significant underlying health issue.
- **Safe Plasma Concentration**: Plasma sodium concentration > 130 mEq/L is considered safe for anaesthesia (Oxford Handbook suggests > 120 mEq/L).
- **Cerebral Oedema**: May manifest as low minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) requirements intraoperatively and present as confusion, agitation, or somnolence postoperatively.
- **ECG Changes**: Bradycardia, QRS widening, T wave inversions, ST segment changes, ventricular fibrillation (VF), or ventricular tachycardia (VT).
##### Acute vs. Chronic Hyponatremia
- **Risk of Central Pontine Myelinolysis**: Rapid overcorrection can lead to this serious condition.
##### Physiologic Manifestations (Severe = Neurologic Symptoms or < 120 mEq/L)
- **Central Nervous System**: Decreased level of consciousness (LOC), seizures, cerebral edema, central pontine myelinolysis.
- **Volume Status**: Can present with hyperor hypovolemia.
- **Respiratory Arrest**: Risk increases with severe hyponatremia.
- **Decreased MAC**: Lower anaesthetic requirements due to CNS effects.
#### Aetiology
##### Hypervolemia
- **Conditions**: Congestive cardiac failure (CCF), hypoalbuminemia (cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome), renal failure, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) syndrome.
##### Euvolemia
- **Conditions**: Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) due to stress, pain, post-neurosurgery; psychogenic causes.
##### Hypovolemia
- **Conditions**: Cerebral salt wasting, hemorrhage, Addison's disease, peritonitis, edema from burns, diarrhea, diuretics.
#### Management
- **Preoperative Correction**: Correct severe hyponatremia before surgery.
- **Volume Deficit**: Restore volume deficit with normal saline.
- **Normal Saline**: 20 mL/kg IV bolus as needed.
- **Plasma Sodium Restoration**: Calculate sodium deficit and replace accordingly.
##### Sodium Deficit Calculation
- **Formula**:
 Na deficit (mEq) = TBW X (Desired Na} - (Present Na)

- **Replacement with NaCl 0.9%**:
- NaCl 0.9% = 154{ mEq of Na/L}
- Na deficit/154 = Replacement volume of NaCl (L)
- **Avoid Rapid Overcorrection**: Target 0.5-1 mEq/hr, with a maximum increase of < 8 mEq in 24 hours. Replace over 48 hours.
- **Replacement Rate**:
Replacement volume (mL)/48 hours {mL/h}
##### Acute Hyponatremia
- **Water Restriction**: Generally restrict free water intake to 500 mL-1 L/day with or without diuretics.
- **Severe Hyponatremia**:
  - Hypertonic saline 3% at 1-2 mL/kg/hr until Na > 125 mEq/L.
  - Loop diuretics.
  - Sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/mL) for seizure control: 0.5-1 mL/kg boluses as needed.
#### SIADH
- **Treatment**: Address the underlying cause and implement fluid restriction. Identify and treat any mineralocorticoid deficiency.
#### ECG Changes

## Potassium
### Hyperkalaemia

#### Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240129140420.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020240312130932.png)

### Calculation for Replacement

- **Potassium Deficit Calculation**:
- Kdeficit(mmol)= (Knormal lower limit[3.5]−Kmeasured)×body weight (kg)×0.4
### Aetiology
#### Shift

- **Causes**: Metabolic or respiratory acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, digoxin toxicity.
#### Total Body Excess

- **Conditions**: Rhabdomyolysis (malignant hyperthermia, crush injuries, burns), post cardiopulmonary bypass, iatrogenic (IV or oral potassium administration), hemolysis, tumor lysis, transfusion (massive transfusion, old packed red blood cells), renal failure, hypoaldosteronism, Addison's disease.
#### Drugs

- **Medications**: Succinylcholine, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, spironolactone, NSAIDs, cyclosporin.
### Systemic Effects

- **Cardiovascular**: Arrhythmias.
- **Muscular**: Muscle weakness.
### ECG Changes in Hyperkalemia

- **Mild (5.5-6.5 mEq/L)**: Peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval (1st degree AV block).
- **Moderate (6.5-8.0 mEq/L)**: Loss of P wave, prolonged QRS, ST segment elevation, ectopic beats/escape rhythms.
- **Severe (>8.0 mEq/L)**: Progressive widening of QRS, bundle branch blocks, fascicular blocks, sine wave pattern, ventricular fibrillation, asystole.
### Membrane Potential and Conduction

- **Resting Membrane Potential**: Less negative according to Nernst equation due to lower intracellular to extracellular potassium gradient, resulting in reduced potassium efflux.
- **Threshold Potential**: Reduced gap between resting membrane potential and threshold potential increases irritability.
- **Phase 4 Slope**: Lower slope reduces automaticity, leading to slower conduction.
### Management

- **Acute Management**: Immediate measures to stabilize cardiac membranes (e.g., calcium gluconate) and shift potassium intracellularly (e.g., insulin with glucose, beta-agonists).
- **Chronic Management**: Address underlying causes and adjust medications affecting potassium levels. Maintain careful monitoring and correction of serum potassium levels to avoid complications.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240129142355.png)

#### Drug Interactions
- **Succinylcholine**: Contraindicated.
- **Non-Depolarizing Muscle Relaxants**: Resistance may occur.
#### Management
##### Stabilize Myocardium
- **Calcium Gluconate**: 100 mg/kg IV to stabilize cardiac membranes.
##### Shift Potassium Intracellularly
- **Insulin and Glucose**: Administer 0.1 units/kg of insulin with 0.5-1 g/kg of glucose (approximately 25 g of glucose for every 10 units of insulin).
- **Sodium Bicarbonate**: 1 mEq/kg IV to correct acidosis.
- **Ventolin (Albuterol)**: 5-10 mg via nebulizer or 5 mcg/kg IV to stimulate cellular potassium uptake.
- **Hyperventilation**: To induce respiratory alkalosis, which helps shift potassium into cells.
- **Epinephrine**: Can be used to shift potassium intracellularly.
##### Eliminate Potassium
- **Furosemide**: 20-40 mg IV to promote renal excretion of potassium.
- **Kayexalate**: 30 g per rectum (PR) or orally (PO) to bind potassium in the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Dialysis**: For severe hyperkalemia or in cases of renal failure where other methods are insufficient.
### Hypokalemia

#### Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314134735.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020240129140339.png)

#### Anaesthesia Considerations for Hypokalemia

##### Intraoperative Monitoring and Management
- **ECG Monitoring**: Continuous ECG monitoring intraoperatively is essential. Replace potassium if arrhythmias develop.
- **Avoid Worsening Hypokalemia**:
  - Avoid administering insulin, glucose, beta agonists, bicarbonate, hyperventilation, and diuretics as they can exacerbate hypokalemia.
- **Sensitivity to Non-Depolarizing Muscle Relaxants (NDMRs)**: Increased sensitivity necessitates a reduced dose and the use of Train-of-Four (TO4) monitoring.
##### ECG Changes in Hypokalemia
- **T Wave Changes**: Progressive flattening of the T wave.
- **U Wave**: Increasingly prominent U wave.
- **P Wave**: Increased amplitude.
- **P–R Interval**: Prolongation.
- **ST Segment**: Depression.
#### Membrane Potential and Conduction
- **Resting Membrane Potential**: More negative according to the Nernst equation.
  - Lower serum potassium (K⁺) increases the chemical gradient, leading to more potassium moving extracellularly.
- **Threshold Potential**: Larger gap between resting membrane potential and threshold potential decreases cellular irritability.
- **Phase 4 Slope**: Steeper gradient increases automaticity, making the heart more prone to arrhythmias.
#### Summary of Steps for Management

1. **Monitor ECG**: Continuously during the procedure.
2. **Replace Potassium**: If arrhythmias develop, administer potassium cautiously.
3. **Avoid Exacerbating Hypokalemia**:
   - Do not administer treatments that lower serum potassium (insulin, glucose, beta agonists, bicarbonate, hyperventilation, diuretics).
4. **Adjust NDMR Dosage**: Reduce the dose of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants and utilize TO4 monitoring to guide dosing.

## Calcium

### Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240129140711.png)

### Calcium: Physiological Role and Regulation

#### Overview
- **Highly Regulated Cation**: Calcium (Ca²⁺) is crucial for various physiological processes.
- **Functions**:
  - **Cell Death**: Key regulator.
  - **Cardiac Muscle**: Influences the duration and strength of contraction.
  - **Smooth Muscle Contraction**: Involved in blood vessels, airways, and uterus.
  - **Coagulation**: Essential for the blood clotting process.
  - **Bone Metabolism**: Integral component of bone structure and health.
  - **Neurotransmitter and Hormone Release**: Facilitates the release of these signaling molecules.
#### Calcium States in Extracellular Plasma
1. **Free Ionized State**: Active form.
2. **Bound State**: Mostly attached to albumin, with some bound to beta-globulins, phosphate, and citrate.
#### pH Relationship
- **Inverse Relationship with pH**: An increase in pH leads to a decrease in ionized Ca²⁺ concentration.
#### Calcium Levels in Plasma
- **Total Calcium (Ca²⁺)**
  - Normal Range: 2.2-2.5 mmol/L.
  - Distribution: 55% bound, 45% ionized.
- **Ionized Calcium (Ca²⁺)**
  - Normal Range: 1.1-1.3 mmol/L.
  - Represents 50% of total calcium.
- **Protein Bound Calcium (Ca²⁺)**
  - Normal Range: 0.95-1.2 mmol/L.
  - Accounts for 40% of total calcium.
- **Complexed Calcium (Ca²⁺)**
  - Calcium Phosphate and Salts: 0.05 mmol/L.
  - Constitutes 10% of total calcium.
### CALCIUM METABOLISM

#### Vitamin D
- group of related sterols  
	cholecalciferol is formed in the skin  
	-> in liver to 25-hyrdroxcholecalciferol  
	-> in kidney proximal tubules to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol  
	-> this then helps calcium absorption in the intestine
- controlled by parathyroid hormone
-> increases intestinal absorption of Ca2+  
-> increases renal Ca2+ reabsorption  
-> mobilises bone Ca2+ & PO43-
#### Parathyroid Hormone
- secretion increased by hypocalaemia and hypomagnesaemia
- secretion decreased by hypercalcaemia and hypermagnesaemia
-> mobilses Ca2+ from bone  
-> increases renal Ca2+ reabsorption  
-> increases renal PO43excretion  
-> increases formation of 1, 25-dihyroxycholecalciferol
#### Calcitonin
- antagonist of parathyroid hormone
- secreted by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland in response to:  
–hypercalcaemia  
–catecholamines  
–gastrin
-> inhibits the mobilisation of bone Ca2+  
-> increases renal Ca2+ & PO43excretion
### Hypercalcemia

#### Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240312130737.png)

#### Hypercalcemia Management

1. **0.9% Normal Saline (NS)**
   - **Mechanism**: Replaces volume and sodium (Na⁺), which will be co-excreted with calcium (Ca²⁺).
   - **Indication**: Initial treatment to address dehydration and promote renal calcium excretion.
   
1. **Calcitonin**
   - **Mechanism**: Reduces bone resorption and has a mild calciuric effect.
   - **Indication**: Used in severe hypercalcemia.
   - **Onset**: Rapid.

2. **Bisphosphonates**
   - **Mechanism**: Decrease osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.
   - **Indication**: Effective in reducing calcium levels by inhibiting bone breakdown.

3. **Glucocorticoids**
   - **Mechanism**: Useful in cases where hypercalcemia is caused by endogenous calcitriol overproduction.
   - **Indication**: Only used if there is increased calcium due to endogenous calcitriol overproduction.

4. **Diuretics**
   - **Consideration**: Generally avoided unless the patient is fluid overloaded.
   - **Rationale**: Diuretics can worsen dehydration and are typically not recommended in the initial management of hypercalcemia unless managing fluid overload.
#### ECG Changes

![](Pasted%20image%2020240129143235.png)

#### Correction of Calcium

##### Importance of Correcting Calcium

The correction formula ensures that hypoalbuminemia is not masking hypercalcemia. Without access to ionized calcium measurements (though often available in ICU and theatre via ABG), a low total calcium might falsely indicate low ionized calcium. Albumin affects total calcium but not ionized calcium.

##### Mechanism

Calcium in serum is bound to proteins, primarily albumin. Therefore, total serum calcium concentration in patients with low or high serum albumin levels may not reflect the physiologically significant ionized (free) calcium concentration.

##### Correction Formula

For every 1 g/dL (10 g/L) reduction in serum albumin concentration, the total calcium concentration is lowered by approximately 0.8 mg/dL (0.02 mmol/L) without affecting the ionized calcium concentration. This does not produce symptoms or signs of hypocalcemia.

##### Key Points

- **Purpose**: To determine if low albumin is hiding hypercalcemia.
- **Application**: Applies only to total calcium, not ionized calcium.
- **pH Effect**: pH affects ionized calcium—low pH causes H+ to displace Ca from albumin, increasing ionized calcium.
##### Conversion

- **0.8 mg/dL** is equivalent to **0.02 mmol/L**.

### Hypomagnesaemia

#### Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314134825.png)

#### Definition

- Serum magnesium < 0.75 mmol/L
- Associated with increased ICU mortality
- Common, affecting 10-65% of ICU patients
#### Causes

##### Decreased Intake

- Protein-calorie malnutrition
- Enteral nutrition
- Alcoholism
- Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
- Malabsorption (e.g., gastric-bypass surgery, chronic pancreatitis, sprue, steatorrhea, congenital malabsorption, inflammatory bowel disease)
- Proton pump inhibitors (mechanism unclear, likely decreased GI absorption)
##### Increased Loss

- **Gastrointestinal**:
	- Nasogastric drainage

	- ECG changes similar to hypokalemia
	- Digitalis toxicity
- **Metabolic**:
	- Resistant hypocalcemia
	- Resistant hypokalemia
	- PTH resistance and impaired PTH release

#### Management

- **Resuscitation**:
	- Treat dysrhythmias, seizures, and other life-threatening conditions
- **Magnesium Replacement**:

- **Remove Magnesium from Serum**:
	1. **Dialysis**: Treatment of choice
	2. **Forced Diuresis**:
		- Intravenous normal saline and furosemide
		- Monitor for hypocalcemia, which can exacerbate symptoms

## Phosphate

### Functions of Phosphate (PO4)
- Component of ATP
- Constituent of nucleic acids
- Integral part of phospholipids
- Enzymatic co-factors
- Involvement in cyclic GMP (cGMP) and cyclic AMP (cAMP)
- Part of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG)
- Essential for enzymes in the glycolytic pathway
- Acts as a buffer in the maintenance of plasma pH
- Important for immune system integrity
- Involved in the coagulation cascade
### Hypophosphatemia

#### Definition
- Hypophosphatemia: Serum phosphate < 0.8 mmol/L
	- **Mild**: 0.65-0.8 mmol/L
	- **Moderate**: 0.32-0.65 mmol/L
	- **Severe**: Actions on intestine, kidneys, and bone
#### Pathophysiology
- Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases phosphate and calcium release from bone but increases excretion in the kidney by inhibiting reabsorption in the proximal tubule.
- Vitamin D from the kidneys increases absorption of calcium and phosphate in the jejunum.
#### Causes
- **Decreased Intake**:
	- Malnutrition
	- Phosphate binders
	- Vitamin D deficiency
	- Malabsorption
	- Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
- **Redistribution**:
	- Refeeding syndrome
	- Insulin administration in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
- **Increased Output**:
	- **Urinary**: Diuretics, osmotic diuresis, hyperparathyroidism, proximal tubular dysfunction (Fanconi’s syndrome)
	- **Non-urinary**:
		- Upper GI
		- Mid GI
		- Lower GI (diarrhea)
		- Other: Sweat, burns, sepsis, bleeding
#### Clinical Features
- **Cardiovascular**:
	- Reversible dilated cardiomyopathy
	- Increased inotrope requirement
- **Respiratory**:
	- Respiratory failure
	- Ventilator dependence
	- Left shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve
- **Neurological**:
	- Altered mental state
	- Weakness
	- Gait disturbance
	- Paresthesias
- **Hematological**:
	- Hemolysis
	- Disorders of white blood cell function
- **Endocrine**:
	- Bone demineralization
- **Musculoskeletal**:
	- Rhabdomyolysis
#### Management
- Ensure adequate feeding (caution in refeeding syndrome)
- **Oral Phosphate**: For levels 0.65-0.89 mmol/L
- **Intravenous Phosphate**:
	- KH2PO4: 10 mmol of phosphate and 10 mmol of potassium in 10 mL
	- NaKH2PO4: 13.4 mmol of phosphate, 21.4 mmol of sodium, 2.6 mmol of potassium in 20 mL
	- Administer 1 ampoule over 1 hour
- Caution with phosphate administration in renal failure
- Monitor for hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hypotension, tetany, and ECG changes
### Hyperphosphatemia

#### Definition
- Hyperphosphatemia: Elevated serum phosphate levels
#### Causes
- **Renal Failure**
- **Increased Renal Resorption**:
	- Hypoparathyroidism
	- Thyrotoxicosis
- **Cellular Injury with Release**:
	- Tumor lysis syndrome
	- Rhabdomyolysis
	- Hemolysis
	- Ischemic gut
- **Medication-Related**:
	- Phosphate-containing laxatives
	- Excessive phosphate administration
	- Bisphosphonate therapy
#### Clinical Features
- Symptoms often related to associated hypocalcemia:
	- Precipitation of calcium (nephrolithiasis)
	- Interference with parathyroid hormone-mediated bone resorption
	- Decreased vitamin D levels
	- Muscle cramping
	- Tetany
	- Hyperreflexia
	- Seizures
	- Cardiovascular manifestations (prolonged QT interval)
#### Management
- Treat underlying condition
- Limit phosphate intake
- Enhance urinary phosphate excretion (saline, acetazolamide)
- Dialysis
- Oral phosphate binders (calcium and aluminum salts)
