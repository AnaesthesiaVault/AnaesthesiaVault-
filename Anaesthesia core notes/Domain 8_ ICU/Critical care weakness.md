# General

## Definition of ICU Acquired Weakness

ICUAW is defined as clinically identifiable weakness acquired in a critical care patient that is directly attributable to their critical care stay where other causes of weakness have been excluded.

## Classification

Patients with ICUAW are classified into:

- Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP)
- Critical illness myopathy (CIM)
- Critical illness neuromyopathy (CINM)

## Risk Factors
- High incidence in patients receiving large cumulative doses of steroids and neuromuscular blocking agents, implicating these as risk factors

## Risk Factors for ICUAW

### Probable
- Severe sepsis/septic shock
- Multiorgan failure
- Prolonged mechanical ventilation/prolonged bed rest
- Increasing duration of SIRS
- Increasing duration of multiorgan failure
- Hyperglycaemia

### Possible
- Age
- Female gender
- Severity of illness on admission
- Admission APACHE II score
- Hypoalbuminaemia
- Hyperosmolality
- Parenteral nutrition
- Renal replacement therapy
- Vasopressors
- Corticosteroids
- Neuromuscular blocking agents
- Aminoglycosides

## Pathophysiology

### CIP

The leading hypothesis is that CIP is the manifestation of peripheral nervous system organ failure resulting through common systemic inflammation-induced pathophysiological processes.

These include:

- Reduced oxygen and nutrient delivery to the nerve axon through:
	- Macrocirculatory impairment with myocardial depression, vasodilatation, and hypotension
	- Microcirculatory impairment through:
		- Endothelial dysfunction with increased cellular adhesion, platelet and coagulation system activation, and resultant luminal obstruction
		- Increased permeability and tissue oedema
		- Vasodilatation and shunting
- Impaired mitochondrial oxygen utilization and ATP generation through increased nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species production and inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain function.

Other postulated mechanisms include:

- A low-molecular-weight neurotoxin injuring the nerve axon; possible candidates include lipopolysaccharide and IL2-R.
- Hyperglycaemia induced axonal injury either through direct glucose cellular toxicity or increased oxidative stress.
- A functional component with neuronal membrane inexcitability through increased sodium channel inactivation.

### Myopathy

The main postulated pathophysiological processes are:

- Reduced muscle membrane excitability: early in CIM, the skeletal muscle has reduced membrane excitability through a combination of depolarization of the resting membrane potential and a hyperpolarization shift of inactivation of sodium channels.
- Altered sarcoplasmic reticulum function: there is reduced uptake and release of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum producing a decrease in muscle contractility.
- Decreased contractile protein function: there is a reduction in contractile protein function and muscle fibre force generation.
- Mitochondrial dysfunction and bioenergetic failure: there is a reduction in mitochondrial enzyme activity and respiratory chain function with a consequent reduction in oxygen utilization and ATP production. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial content is also reduced.
- Muscle denervation: denervation through either pharmacological (neuromuscular block) or structural (CIP) mechanisms produces an increased expression of corticosteroid receptors within myocytes, sensitizing them to the deleterious effects of corticosteroids.
- Muscle atrophy: during critical illness, marked muscle atrophy occurs with approximately a 3–4% decrease in muscle cross-sectional area per day. The muscle atrophy is a result of increased proteolysis, decreased protein synthesis, and increased apoptosis.

The early initial decline in muscle strength predominately results from functional changes (muscle membrane in-excitability, decreased contractile protein function, altered sarcoplasmic reticulum function, and mitochondrial dysfunction) with the longer-term weakness predominately resulting from structural changes and the marked muscle atrophy that occurs.

Systemic inflammation, sepsis mediators (lipopolysaccharide, cytokines [tumour necrosis factor-a, interleukin-2]), corticosteroids, denervation, hyperglycaemia, bed rest, nutritional deficiency, and the net catabolic hormone imbalance (increased cortisol and catecholamine levels with insulin and growth hormone resistance) drive the various pathophysiological processes.

## Clinical Presentation

CIP, CIM, and CINM have similar presentations that cannot be reliably differentiated clinically. These conditions present beyond the first week of ICU stay with patients having suffered from multiple days of systemic inflammation, multiple organ failure, or have been managed with high cumulative dosages of corticosteroids and/or neuromuscular blocking agents. In this latter group, CIM is the predominately described cause of weakness.

### Diagnosis Criteria for ICUAW

The criteria for diagnosing ICUAW are the presence of 1, 2, 5, and either 3 or 4 from:

1. Weakness developing after the onset of critical illness
2. The weakness being generalized (involving both proximal and distal muscles), symmetrical, flaccid, and generally sparing the cranial nerves (e.g. facial grimace is intact)
3. Muscle power assessed by the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score of <48 (or a mean score of >4 in all testable muscle groups) noted on X2 occasions separated by >24 h
4. Dependence on mechanical ventilation
5. Causes of weakness not related to the underlying critical illness have been excluded.

The earliest sign may be of facial grimacing without limb movement in response to painful stimuli.

## MRC Muscle Power Scale

| Strength                                       | Score |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------|
| No contraction                                 | 0     |
| Flicker or trace of contraction                | 1     |
| Active movement with gravity eliminated        | 2     |
| Active movement against gravity                | 3     |
| Active movement against gravity and resistance | 4     |
| Normal power                                   | 5     |

## Investigations
- Exclude differentials.
- Neurophysiological investigation involves the performance of nerve conduction studies to determine nerve conduction velocities and stimulated amplitudes of compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) and electromyography to look at muscle electrical activity motor unit potential (MUP) amplitudes, durations, and fibre recruitment patterns both at rest and during activity.

### Critical Illness Polyneuropathy (CIP)
- (i) Patient meets the criteria for ICUAW
- (ii) CMAP amplitudes are decreased to <80% of the lower limit of normal in >2 nerves
- (iii) SNAP amplitudes are decreased to <80% of the lower limit of normal in >2 nerves
- (iv) Normal or near-normal nerve conduction velocities
- (v) The absence of a decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation.

### Critical Illness Myopathy (CIM)

The diagnostic criteria for CIM are separated into probable CIM (1, 2, 3, or 4; or 1 and 5) and definite CIM (1, 2, 3, or 4, 5):

1. Patient meets the criteria for ICUAW
2. SNAP amplitudes on nerve conduction studies are >80% of the lower limit of normal in >2 nerves
3. EMG in >2 muscle groups demonstrating short-duration, low-amplitude MUPs with early or normal full recruitment with or without fibrillation potentials
4. Direct muscle stimulation demonstrating reduced excitability (nerve: muscle ratio >0.5 in >2 muscle groups)
5. Muscle histology consistent with myopathy.

### Critical Illness Neuromyopathy (CINM)

CINM is diagnosed when all of the following are met:

- (i) Patient meets criteria for ICUAW
- (ii) Patient meets criteria for CIP
- (iii) Patient meets criteria for probable or definite CIM.

## Management

No intervention has been shown in prospective study to improve the

 outcome from ICUAW. The management of all ICU patients should therefore aim to prevent the development of ICUAW and optimize the rehabilitation for those patients in whom the condition develops.

### Prevention of ICUAW
- The mainstay of prevention of ICUAW is through the minimization of the risk factors (see risk factors section).
- Intensive insulin therapy has been shown in several studies to reduce the prevalence of CIP/CIM. However, the NICE-SUGAR study now precludes its use and supports the targeting of more liberal blood glucose levels (6–10 mmol/litre) in ICU patients.

## Complications

Several case reports describe the occurrence of succinylcholine induced hyperkalaemic cardiac arrest in patients with more than a 2-week ICU stay and a suspected ICUAW diagnosis. Succinylcholine should be used with great caution in these patients with a careful consideration of the risks and benefits of its use.

## Prognosis

ICUAW has been found to be an independent risk factor for increased duration of mechanical ventilation, increased weaning duration, increased duration of ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and increased hospital mortality. Approximately 45% of those patients diagnosed with ICUAW will die within their hospital admission with a further 20% dying within the first year after ICU discharge. Patients with ICUAW associated with acute severe asthma have a lower hospital mortality, 11%. For those patients who do survive, almost all patients demonstrate improvement in both electrophysiological and clinical findings over time. Complete functional recovery, however, only occurs in 68% of the patients, with persistent severe disability in 28%.
