# Recommendations to Prevent AKI in ICU

## Volume Expansion
1. **Controlled Fluid Resuscitation:**
   - Recommend controlled fluid resuscitation in volume depletion while avoiding volume overload. **(Grade 1C)**
2. **Avoid Starches:**
   - Recommend against the use of starches due to shown harm and suggest not using gelatine or dextrans for fluid resuscitation. **(Grade 1A, Grade 2C)**
3. **Correction of Hypovolaemia:**
   - Recommend correction of hypovolaemia/dehydration using isotonic crystalloids in patients receiving intravascular contrast media. **(Grade 1B)**
4. **Monitoring:**
   - Recommend regular monitoring of chloride levels and acid-base status when using chloride-rich solutions. **(Best Practice Statement, BPS)**
5. **Balanced Crystalloids:**
   - Suggest the use of balanced crystalloids for large volume resuscitation. **(Grade 2C)**
6. **Colloids:**
   - Suggest using human serum albumin if a colloid is necessary for treating patients with septic shock. **(Grade 2C)**
7. **Prophylactic Volume Expansion:**
   - Suggest prophylactic volume expansion with crystalloids to prevent AKI caused by specific drugs. **(BPS)**
8. **Contrast-Enhanced Investigations:**
   - Suggest not delaying urgent contrast-enhanced investigations or interventions for potential preventative measures. **(BPS)**

## Diuretics
1. **Loop Diuretics:**
   - Recommend against loop diuretics solely for the prevention of AKI. **(Grade 1B)**
2. **Fluid Overload:**
   - Suggest using diuretics to control or avoid fluid overload in diuretic-responsive patients. **(Grade 2D)**

## Vasopressors
1. **Titration of Vasopressors:**
   - Recommend titrating vasopressors to a MAP of 65–70 mmHg rather than a higher target (80–85 mmHg) in septic shock patients. For chronic hypertension patients, recommend a higher target (80–85 mmHg) for renal protection in septic shock. **(Grade 1B, Grade 1C)**
2. **Systolic Pressure:**
   - Recommend lowering systolic pressure to 140–190 mmHg rather than 110–139 mmHg in patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage and severe admission hypertension. **(Grade 1C)**
3. **First-Choice Vasopressor:**
   - Recommend norepinephrine (along with correction of hypovolemia) as the first-choice vasopressor to protect kidney function and suggest vasopressin in vasoplegic shock post-cardiac surgery. **(Grade 1B, Grade 2C)**
4. **Individualizing Target Pressure:**
   - Suggest individualizing target pressure when premorbid blood pressure is available. **(BPS)**

## Vasodilators
1. **Low-Dose Dopamine:**
   - Recommend against low-dose dopamine for AKI protection. **(Grade 1A)**
2. **Levosimendan:**
   - Recommend against using levosimendan for renal protection in sepsis and cardiac surgery patients with poor preoperative left ventricular function or requiring postoperative hemodynamic support. **(Grade 1B)**
3. **Fenoldopam/Natriuretic Peptides:**
   - Suggest not using fenoldopam or natriuretic peptides for renal protection in critically ill or cardiovascular surgery patients at risk of AKI. **(Grade 2B)**

## Sedation
1. **Current Data:**
   - No recommendation based on current data, but shorter sedation using propofol or dexmedetomidine may reduce AKI rates. **(BPS)**

## Hormonal Manipulation
1. **Blood Glucose Level:**
   - Suggest targeting a blood glucose level below 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) to prevent hyperglycemic kidney damage in ICU patients. **(Grade 2B)**
2. **Erythropoietin/Steroids:**
   - Suggest not using erythropoietin or steroids for AKI prevention. **(Grade 2B)**

## Metabolic Interventions
1. **IV Selenium:**
   - Recommend against high-dose IV selenium for renal protection in critically ill patients. **(Grade 1B)**
2. **N-Acetylcysteine:**
   - Suggest not using N-acetylcysteine to prevent contrast-associated AKI in critically ill patients due to conflicting results and possible adverse effects. **(Grade 2B)**
3. **Nutritional Support:**
   - Suggest adequate nutritional support, preferably through the enteral route, for patients with or at risk of AKI. **(BPS)**

## Statins
1. **Perioperative Statins:**
   - Recommend against the perioperative use of high-dose statins to prevent postoperative AKI in cardiac surgery. **(Grade 1A)**
2. **Short-Term Statins:**
   - Suggest short-term use of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to prevent contrast-associated AKI in high-risk patients undergoing coronary contrast angiography. **(Grade 2B)**

## Remote Ischemic Preconditioning
1. **Preconditioning:**
   - Suggest not using remote ischemic preconditioning for AKI prevention in critically ill patients. **(Grade 2A)**

## Care Bundles
1. **KDIGO Recommendations:**
   - Suggest using KDIGO recommendations to reduce AKI incidence after cardiac surgery. **(Grade 2C)**
2. **AKI Care Bundles:**
   - Suggest the use of AKI care bundles outside the ICU to improve AKI outcomes. **(BPS)**
## Renal Management in ICU

### Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
- **Avoid AKI:** Established renal failure significantly increases mortality.

### Pre-Renal Dysfunction
- **Actively manage usual causes:**
  - **Inadequate hydration:**
	- Look for evidence of fluid depletion.
	- Aggressively correct fluid depletion and evaluate **Fluids**.
  - **Inadequate perfusion pressure:**
	- Ensure Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg.
	- Consider higher MAP in previously hypertensive patients.

### Nephrotoxins
- **Eliminate/control use of nephrotoxins:**
  - Aminoglycosides, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatories, Intravenous Contrast media, etc.

### Biochemical Markers
- **Assess:** Urea, creatinine, PO₄³⁻ (changes are late indicators).
  - **Formulas:** Cockroft-Gault and MDRD are unreliable in acute situations.
  - **Markers:** Use NGAL as a marker of renal tubular injury if available.

### Scoring Systems: RIFLE or KDIGO
- **RIFLE R, I / KDIGO 1, 2:**
  - Address pre-renal issues and nephrotoxins aggressively.
  - Manage likely scenarios leading to renal injury even before biochemical changes are apparent.
	- Example: Septic shock from Gram-negative infection/inflammatory shock state with hypotension.
- **RIFLE-F / KDIGO 3:**
  - **Change strategy:** Ensure no ongoing pre-renal deficits, but avoid attempts at supra-normalization.
  - **Fluid management:** Restrict fluids to match actual output.
  - **Plan for Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT):**
	- Peritoneal dialysis (default if intact abdomen).
	- Intermittent Hemodialysis (IHD): Coordinate with nephrology.
	- Continuous Veno-Venous Hemofiltration (CVVH).
  - **Manage complications while awaiting RRT:**
	- **Hyperkalaemia:** Use Resonium, Insulin-Dextrose, Salbutamol.
	- **Oliguria:** Use Furosemide to prevent fluid overload.
	  - Administer large boluses usually.
	  - Abandon Furosemide if kidneys are unresponsive to 1 + 2 + 4 mg/kg challenges.
	  - Note: Urine output with Furosemide ≠ good kidney function.

### Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)
- **Consider RRT for "non-renal" reasons:** Toxin elimination, rapid fluid control, etc.
