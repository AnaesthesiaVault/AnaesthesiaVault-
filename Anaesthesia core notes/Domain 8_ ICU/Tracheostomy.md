# Tracheostomy Emergencies

## Preparing for Tracheostomy Emergencies
- Have a back-up airway plan prepared in advance.
- Have a back-up tracheostomy of the same size and one of a smaller size immediately available.
- Know if the patient can be intubated or ventilated from above.
- Know the placement date of the tracheostomy (ideally this information should be on a sign at the head of the bed).
## Approach to Tracheostomy Emergencies
- **Categories of Emergencies**: Accidental decannulation, obstruction, and bleeding.
- **Timing**: The approach differs in the 7-14 days after initial tracheostomy placement compared with later, as the tracheotomy tract takes time to mature.
### Decannulation

#### Early (<7-14 days)
- **Do NOT attempt re-insertion** due to the risk of creating a false tract (stoma is not mature).
- Call for help (e.g., airway code).
- Oxygenate and ventilate from above while preparing to intubate.
- Intubate.

#### Late (>7-14 days)
- Prepare a back-up airway.
- Oxygenate and ventilate from above.
- Attempt to replace the tracheostomy (can insert obturator) and may need to downsize.
- Confirm proper placement, ideally with bronchoscopy.
- If unable to re-insert, intubate.

### Obstruction

#### Early (<7-14 days)
- Prepare a back-up airway plan.
- Deflate cuff and oxygenate from above.
- Remove inner cannula.
- Attempt to pass suction catheter and clear obstruction.
- Consider bronchoscopy if immediately available.
- If unable to clear, intubate from above.

#### Late (>7-14 days)
- Prepare a back-up airway plan.
- Deflate cuff and oxygenate from above.
- Remove inner cannula.
- Attempt to pass suction catheter and clear obstruction.
- Consider bronchoscopy if immediately available.
- If still obstructed, attempt to replace and may need to downsize the tracheostomy tube.

### Bleeding

#### Early (<7-14 days)
- Early bleeding may be at the surgical site, from suction trauma, or due to tracheitis; consider lower airway bleeding/hemoptysis.
- **Treatment**: Inflate cuff, apply direct pressure, apply topical silver nitrate.

#### Late (>7-14 days)
- Late bleeding may be due to the above or due to the development of a **tracheo-innominate fistula**: erosion of the tracheostomy causing a fistula between the innominate artery and trachea. Look for ETT pulsations.
- This can cause life-threatening hemorrhage.
- **Treatment**: Overinflate cuff to tamponade, ventilate from above and remove tracheostomy, intubate from above. Insert finger into stoma and pull anteriorly to occlude the innominate artery. Surgical management of hemorrhage will be required (high mortality without surgery).

## Anaesthesia for Tracheostomy

### Considerations
- Shared airway.
- Possible difficult airway.
- Close communication with the surgeon; backup plan discussed.
- Indication for tracheostomy and concomitant injuries (e.g., traumatic brain injury, C-spine injury).
- Potentially critically ill patient with limited reserve, multi-organ failure.
- Potential catastrophic complications:
	- Loss of airway, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, aspiration, false passage/tracheal disruption.
	- Airway fire (use low FiO2, limit cautery use).

### Goals & Conflicts
- Optimize underlying disease state: assess stability for elective tracheostomy (high FiO2 & ventilator support, high dose inotropes/vasopressors, raised ICP, severe volume overload, coagulopathy/DIC).
- Surgical plan discussed along with backups and additional equipment.
- Reduce risk of aspiration: ensure NPO status, apply gastric suction.
- Ensure a motionless surgical field (paralysis).
- Balance low FiO2 (to protect against airway fire) against high FiO2 requirements.

### Considerations for the Patient with a Tracheostomy
- **Difficult Airway**:
	- Difficult bag-mask ventilation (BMV) and supraglottic device ventilation (air leak).
	- Prefer direct vision for ETT placement.
- **Indications for Tracheostomy**:
	- Pulmonary toilet.
	- Respiratory failure/chronic ventilation.
	- Threatened airway.
	- Aspiration risk.
- **Comorbid Disease**:
	- ICU patient with multi-organ failure, sepsis, lung injury, etc.
	- Neuromuscular disorders, chronic high spinal cord injury.
- **Complications of Long-Term Tracheostomy**:
	- Tracheo-innominate fistula, suctioning injuries, trachea/stoma site infection/bleeding, laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, tracheal rupture, tracheal stenosis.
- **Ensure Emergency Tracheostomy Equipment Available**:
	- Various sizes of cuffed/uncuffed tracheostomy tubes, suction catheters, graspers, ambubag, and ties.

## Tracheostomy

### Indications
- Ventilation: >7 days intubated
- Airway obstruction
- Airway protection
- Secretions

### Benefits
- Decreasing direct laryngeal injury
- Improving comfort
- Enhancing activities of daily living such as mobility, speech, and eating
- Minimizing risk for tracheal stenosis

### Absolute Contraindications to Percutaneous Tracheostomy
- Insertion site tissue infection
- Operator inexperience
- Cervical instability
- Uncontrolled coagulopathy

### Performing a Percutaneous Tracheostomy

#### Sizing of Tubes
- Proper sizing depends on length, inner diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and curvature.
- Size number usually refers to the ID of the outer cannula, measured in mm (e.g., Portex 6.0 has an ID of 6mm).
- ID and OD sizes are always written on the flange.
- Some tubes have an adjustable flange.
- Specially made longer tracheostomy tubes may be called XLT (extra long tubes).
