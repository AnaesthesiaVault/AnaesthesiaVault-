# Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS)

## Introduction

### Definition
- A sustained intra-abdominal pressure >20 mmHg (with or without APP <60 mmHg) associated with new organ dysfunction.
  - Patients with intra-abdominal pressure <10 mmHg generally do not have ACS, while those with intra-abdominal pressure >25 mmHg usually have ACS.

### Types
- **Primary**: Due to injury or disease in the abdominopelvic region (e.g., pancreatitis, abdominal trauma). Intervention (surgical or radiologic) of the primary condition is often needed.
- **Secondary**: Does not originate in the abdomen or pelvis (e.g., fluid resuscitation, sepsis, burns).

## Abdominal HT Vs ACS

- **Intra-abdominal hypertension**: Defined as a sustained intra-abdominal pressure >12 mmHg.
- **Abdominal compartment syndrome**: Occurs at a pressure >20 mmHg associated with new organ dysfunction.

**Intra-abdominal hypertension is graded as follows:**
- Grade 1: >12–15 mmHg
- Grade 2: >16–20 mmHg
- Grade 3: >21–25 mmHg
- Grade 4: >25 mmHg

**Recommendations:**
- Maintain abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) above 60 mmHg, as this correlates with improved outcomes.
- Multiple regression analysis has shown that APP, as a resuscitation endpoint, is superior to other endpoints such as arterial pH, base deficit, lactate, and urine output.

## Risk Factors

### Diminished Abdominal Wall Compliance
- Acute respiratory failure, elevated intrathoracic pressure
- Abdominal surgery with tight primary closure
- Major trauma/burns
- Prone positioning, head of bed >30°
- High BMI, central obesity

### Increased Intra-luminal Contents
- Gastroparesis
- Ileus
- Colonic pseudo-obstruction

### Increased Abdominal Contents
- Haemoperitoneum/pneumoperitoneum
- Ascites/liver dysfunction

### Capillary Leak/Fluid Resuscitation
- Acidosis (pH <7.2)
- Hypotension
- Hypothermia (core temp <33°C)
- Polytransfusion (>10 units blood/24h)
- Coagulopathy (platelets <55,000 mm³, PT >15s, PTT >2x normal, or INR >1.5)
- Massive fluid resuscitation (>5L/24h)
- Pancreatitis
- Oliguria
- Sepsis
- Major trauma/burns
- Damage control laparotomy

## Diagnosis
- **Monitoring IAP** due to raised clinical suspicion of increased IAP in patients with risk factors.
- **Direct**: Needle/line directly into the peritoneum, connected to a pressure transducer. This method is uncommon due to the risk of iatrogenic injury.
- **Indirect**: Intragastric, intra-uterine, rectal, or intra-vesical.

### Intra-Vesical Measurement
- Foley catheter connected to a barometer via a 3-way tap or pressure transducer (zeroed at the iliac crest in the mid-axillary line).
- Insert catheter and allow residual urine to drain.
- Fill bladder with 25 mL saline or 1 mL/kg if <20 kg.
- Clamp the catheter and measure the pressure at the end of expiration and in the supine position.

## Management

### Intra-Abdominal Hypertension (IAH)
1. **Patient has IAH (IAP ≥ 12 mmHg)**
   - Initiate treatment to reduce IAP:
	 - Avoid excessive fluid resuscitation
	 - Optimize organ perfusion

2. **Monitor IAP with serial measurements at least every 4 hours while the patient is critically ill**
   - **IAP > 20 mmHg with new organ failure?**
	 - Yes: **Patient has ACS**
	 - No: Monitor IAP until IAP < 12 mmHg consistently

3. **IAH has resolved**
   - Discontinue IAP measurements
   - Monitor the patient for clinical deterioration

### Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS)
1. **Identify and treat underlying etiology for the patient's ACS**
   - Does the patient have Primary ACS?
	 - Yes: Perform/revise abdominal decompression with temporary abdominal closure as needed to reduce IAP.
	 - No: Patient has Secondary or Recurrent ACS.

2. **Monitor IAP/APP at least every 4 hours while the patient is critically ill**
   - **Is IAP > 25 mmHg with progressive organ failure?**
	 - Yes: Continue medical treatment options to reduce IAP.
	 - No: Perform balanced resuscitation of central preload, contractility, and afterload using crystalloid/colloid/vasoactive medications. Avoid excessive fluid resuscitation.

3. **Can APP be maintained ≥ 60 mmHg?**
   - Yes: Continue current management.
   - No: Repeat steps until IAP < 12 mmHg consistently.
