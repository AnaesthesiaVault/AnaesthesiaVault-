# Respiratory and Breathing Management in ICU

## General Goals
- **SpO₂ ≥ 90%; avoid hypoxemia**
  - Accept lower SpO₂ only in patients with known chronic hypoxaemic lung disease and known reasonable function with SpO₂ < 90%.
- **Avoid hyperoxia**
  - Reduce FiO₂ if SpO₂ > 95% (down to FiO₂ 0.21 if necessary).
- **No excessive work of breathing**
  - Breath Rate < 30 breaths per minute.
  - No excessive muscle usage; patient appears to be breathing comfortably.
- **Appropriate respiratory excursions**
  - Reasonably-sized clinical chest movement and appropriate tidal volumes, at a regular rate.
- **Relatively normal PaCO₂**
  - PaCO₂ up to 8kPa routinely acceptable in patients with severe lung injury undergoing lung-protective ventilation if no raised intracranial pressure or known severe pulmonary hypertension.
  - PaCO₂ 4.8–5.2 kPa for patients with raised intracranial pressure (e.g. head injury with diminished GCS).

### Administer Oxygen via Face Mask or Nasal Cannula
- **Use lowest FiO₂ that gives SpO₂ 90-96%.**
  - Use of High Flow Humidified Oxygen (Optiflow™) via proprietary nasal cannulae may improve patient comfort, overcome airway obstruction, assist some patients with borderline respiratory muscle strength, and allow titration of FiO₂, and allows humidification which reduces upper airway damage.
- **Use Non-Invasive CPAP**
  - Simple devices (e.g., reservoir face mask with one-way valves) to achieve SpO₂ > 90% especially implies need for positive pressure ventilation (IPPV).
  - Indications: pneumonia, pneumocystis-jerovici pneumonia, chronic bronchitis.

### Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV)
- Primary use of invasive ventilation (via face mask) is only recommended for patients with significant lung disease (e.g., severe asthma, severe COPD) or other clinical indications when nasal high flow is not possible or not suitable (e.g., head injury).
- Positive pressure ventilation may be used as a rescue strategy to reduce the work of breathing and avoid intubation in patients with acute respiratory distress or severe lung injury.

### Review Ventilatory Support
- **What proportion of lung patient(s) of respiratory failure led to initiation of respiratory support (have they reached a point where an alternative approach may be more appropriate)?**
  - Invasive ventilation at tidal volumes of patient airway protection.
  - Obstructive patients: 7 ml/kg PBW (predicted body weight) for IPPV–hypooxemia and hypercarbia easy.
  - Hypercapnic patients: normal PaCO₂, aim for higher IPPV to relieve work of breathing eg.
- **Assess weaning ventilatory strategy in accordance with the currently-appropriate ventilatory strategy**
  - Routine extubation:
	- Chronic lung disease
	- Recurrent extubation? trial recruitment of?
	- Acute lung disease with prominent atelectasis

#### Initial Ventilator Settings - Lung Protective Strategy
- **Mode: Pressure Assist-Control**
  - Most efficient alveolar air delivery, most physiological waveform, allowing easiest transition to spontaneous breathing.
- **Preset: FiO₂ 100%, PEEP 10, Rate 15 br/min, Inspiratory Time 1.2s, Flow Trigger 1 L/min**
  - Adjust Settings: Mandatory Pressure Above PEEP to achieve age-predicted Tidal Volume of 6ml/kg of Predicted Mass for Height (with maximum allowance of 50ml extra if smaller adult or minor).
  - Review settings frequently during the first hour, and hourly thereafter:
	- SpO₂ 90–96% (adjust FiO₂).
	- Vte 6ml / KgM for mandatory (non-patient triggered breaths); adjust IPAP appropriately.
  - Encourage transition to patient-triggered breaths (and ultimately to Pressure Support mode).

#### Initial Ventilator Settings - Open Lung Strategy
- **As for Lung Protective, but preceded by a Recruitment Manoeuvre as directed by a consultant.**
  - Occasionally, Volume Assist-Control mode may be preferred by the consultant.
  - Avoid disconnections–arrange for inline suction.
  - Minimise suctioning to reduce subglottic load to avoid patient effort and thus reduce transpulmonary pressure–follow consultant direction.

#### Initial Ventilator Settings - Neuroprotective Strategy
- **As for Lung Protective except preset Rate 20 br/min, Inspiratory Time 1.0s**
  - PEEP 10 cmH₂O has been shown not to raise ICP, and thus is still an acceptable baseline.
  - After 30 minutes: check PaCO₂; desirable range 4.8–5.2 kPa.
	- If PaCO₂ < 4.8 kPa: reduce rate.
	- If PaCO₂ > 5.2 kPa: increase IPAP to increase VTe to 7 to 8 ml/Kg PMH.
  - Neuroprotection takes priority over lung protection and avoidance of volutrauma.

#### Initial Ventilator Settings - Lung Decompression Strategy
- **Mode: Volume (Assist-Control)**
  - Preset: FiO₂ 100%, PEEP ZERO, Rate 10 breaths / minute, Inspiratory Time 1.0s (for Anea, HLI, AO), Flow Trigger 2 L/min.
  - Adjust tidal volume to 6ml/kg PMH.
  - Adjust Vte to 6ml/kg PMH.
  - Adjust FiO₂ for saturation; consider occasional disconnection to relieve gas-trapping and air-hunger.
  - Adjust Breath Rate and Inspiratory Time to get full exhalation (return to baseline before next breath where feasible).
  - Use of external PEEP more than Zero should only be done at Consultant direction after assessment for intrinsic PEEP: PEEP must be kept below PEEP, and gas trapping must be minimised.
  - DO NOT ALLOW SPONTANEOUS RESPIRATION: DEEPLY SEDATE, CONSIDER NMDR UNTIL DEEP SEDATION ESTABLISHED.

### Review Indications of Ventilation Efficiency
- **Can the patient be progressively weaned from the ventilator?**
  - For patients on Supportive setting other than Lung Protective Strategy, it is essential to initiate weaning early:
	- Consider re-setting the Inspiratory Rate daily (decrease the set rate on the Assist-Control mode to patient tolerance; then assist the rate) and then move them to Pressure Support mode.
- **For Lung Protective Strategy:**
  - Support mode (where the patient controls their own inspiratory time) as soon as it is deemed safe and the patient has a reasonable respiratory pattern; a progressive reduction to 10 ml/kg PMH should be achieved (usually kept to 2-8 cmH₂O).
  - For patients on Open Lung: Neuroprotective or Bronchospasm strategies active weaning should only occur with Consultant direction, as ongoing Control of ventilation and prevention of acute collapse is critical.

### Review Patient Synchrony
- **Does the patient look comfortable on the ventilator?**
  - High breath rates (>25)–consider re-escalating ventilator support (increase Pressure Support, or return to Pressure Assist-Control mode).
	- Tachypnoeic patients on Pressure Support may shorten their Inspiratory Time inappropriately (<0.75s) and should be returned to Pressure Assist-Control mode until respiratory drive is more appropriate.
	- Excessively high breath rates are wasteful of patient energy and may precipitate cardiac failure: consider pharmacological control (e.g., morphine) if ventilatory adjustment does not improve tachypnoea relatively quickly.
  - Trigger synchrony: matching device breaths appropriately when patient makes an effort–ensure Pressure or Flow Trigger is kept low enough and thus most sensitive (< 2cmH₂O or 1L/min respectively); elevation of threshold should only be done if “auto-triggering”.
  - Cycle synchrony: only relevant on Pressure Support mode: ventilator should allow patient to exhale when patient has finished inspiring: if inappropriate exhalation, review Flow Cycle Percentage with consultant or consider return to Pressure Assist-Control mode.

### Oxygenation Index
- **OI = (Pmean x FiO₂%) / (PaO₂ x 7.5): Pmean in cmH₂O or mbar, PaO₂ in kPa**
  - OI > 10: readily weanable–improve alveolar lung disease first.
  - OI = 5-10: not ready for extubation, but oxygenation stable enough to allow some “forced weaning”.
  - OI < 5: oxygenation good enough to consider removal from positive pressure ventilation, but follow Extubation Feasibility Review (see under “Airway” above).

### Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (only Useful in Pressure Support, ΔP < 10cmH₂O)
- **RSBI = Respiratory Rate / Vte in LITRES**
  - RSBI > 100: mechanically inefficient, likely to fail removal from positive pressure ventilation.
  - RSBI < 80: mechanically probably efficient enough to cope with removal from positive pressure ventilation.

## Hypoxia Vs Hypoxemia

**Hypoxia**: Insufficient oxygen delivered to tissues to meet demands.  
**Hypoxemia**: Low oxygen in the blood (most common type of hypoxia).

### Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings of Hypoxemic Hypoxia

#### Diffusion Limitation
- **Causes**: Interstitial lung disease, PHTN, increased interstitial tissue or vasculature.
- **Effect**: Thickening of the alveolar membrane leading to decreased diffusion across alveolar membrane.
- **Consequences**:
	- Inefficient blood flow to ventilated areas.
	- Decrease in average PaO2 levels.
	- Exertional desaturation.
- **A-a Gradient**: Increased.
- **Clinical Response**: Significant improvement of PaO2 in response to 100% O2.

#### V/Q Mismatch

- **Causes**: Pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, atelectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma.
- **Effect**: Imbalance between ventilation and perfusion; some alveoli are well-perfused but not well-ventilated (low V/Q), while others are well-ventilated but poorly perfused (high V/Q).
- **Consequences**:
	- **V/Q mismatch**: Leads to areas with low V/Q, causing hypoxemia because poorly ventilated alveoli do not adequately oxygenate the blood.
- **A-a Gradient**: Increased due to impaired gas exchange.
- **Clinical Response**: Significant improvement in PaO2 with 100% O2, as oxygen can still reach some of the underventilated but perfused alveoli.

#### R → L Shunt

- **Causes**: Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), congenital cardiac defects like Tetralogy of Fallot, Eisenmenger syndrome.
- **Effect**: Blood bypasses the lungs completely, leading to non-oxygenated blood mixing with oxygenated blood, reducing overall PaO2.
- **Consequences**: No significant improvement in PaO2 with 100% O2 administration because the shunted blood does not come into contact with alveoli, and thus cannot be oxygenated.
- **A-a Gradient**: Increased, often more significantly than with V/Q mismatch.
- **Clinical Response**: Negligible improvement of PaO2 in response to 100% O2 due to the presence of shunted blood that remains unoxygenated.

#### Hypoventilation
- **Causes**: Central (drugs, coma, hypothyroidism), peripheral (damaged lung structure, chest wall disorders).
- **Effect**: Decreased central and peripheral ventilation leading to reduced gas exchange.
- **Consequences**:
	- Decreased PaO2.
	- Increased PaCO2
	- Altered level of consciousness.
- **A-a Gradient**: Normal.
- **Clinical Response**: Raised PaCO2.

#### Inspired O2

- **Causes**: High altitude, reduced barometric pressure (e.g., during air travel or in high-altitude locations).
- **Effect**: Decreased partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) in the inspired air, leading to reduced alveolar oxygen levels and decreased driving pressure for oxygen diffusion across alveolar membranes.
- **Consequences**:
	- Reduced PaO2 (hypoxemia).
	- PaCO2 may be slightly reduced if hypoxemia triggers hyperventilation, but this is a secondary effect.
- **A-a Gradient**: Normal (since both alveolar and arterial oxygen levels are decreased proportionately).
- **Clinical Response**: Hypoxemia is generally responsive to supplemental oxygen, which increases the partial pressure of inspired oxygen and restores PaO2 levels.

#### Tissue Hypoxia
- **Consequences**:
	- Insufficient O2 delivery to tissues.
	- Anaerobic metabolism.
	- Central cyanosis.
	- Organ ischemia.
	- Anoxic brain injury.
	- Angina.

### Causes of Hypoxia

#### Central Vs Mixed Venous Saturations
- **Mixed (SvO2)**: Blood returning from upper and lower body. Measured with pulmonary artery catheter.
- **Central (ScvO2)**: Blood returning from upper half of the body. Measured from CVP.

### Alveolar-Arterial Difference

The A-a difference is the alveolar oxygen tension (PAO2) minus the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), reflecting the efficiency of oxygen exchange. It is used to identify the etiology of hypoxemic hypoxia: pulmonary causes have an increased A-a difference whereas extra-pulmonary etiologies (low PiO2, low SvO2, and alveolar hypoventilation) have a normal A-a difference.

**Easy PAO2 Formula**: (FiO2% x 713) – (PaCO2 in mmHg / 0.8).

### Tension-Based Indices of Oxygenation

#### A-a Gradient
- **Definition**: Magnitude of the PO2 gradient between the alveolus and arterial blood.
- **Calculation**: Using the alveolar gas equation and PaO2 measurement.
- **Normal Values**: 7 mmHg (young), 14 mmHg (old).

#### a/A Ratio
- **Definition**: Ratio of arterial to alveolar PaO2.
- **Clinical Significance**: PaO2(a)/A of over 75% is likely normal.
- **Unaffected By**: FiO2, barometric pressure.
- **Low Ratio Causes**: V/Q mismatch, diffusion defect, increased oxygen extraction ratio.

#### PaO2/FiO2 Ratio
- **Definition**: Ratio of alveolar oxygen to inspired oxygen.
- **Clinical Use**: Risk stratification, insensitive to atmospheric pressure changes.
- **Discrimination**: Unable to differentiate etiology of hypoxia.

#### Respiratory Index (RI)
- **Definition**: P(a)O2 - P(a)O2(a)) / P(a)O2.
- **Clinical Use**: Similar to a/A ratio.
- **Normal Values**: RI < 0.4.

### The Alveolar-Arterial pO2 Gradient: Explanation

#### Why It Exists
- **Physiological Reality**: Blood in lung capillaries is not fully oxygenated; venous admixture and various drainage mechanisms contribute.
- **Key Consequence**: The pO2 content in systemic arteries is lower than in alveoli.
- **Clinical Significance**: High A-a gradient (>15 mmHg) indicates pulmonary pathology.

#### Simplified Formula Explanation
- **A-a Gradient**: PAO2−PaO2.
- **Key Components**:
	- **PaO2 (Alveolar Oxygen)**: Fraction of inhaled air (O2 content), barometric pressure, partial pressure of water.
	- **PaO2 (Arterial Oxygen)**: Measured by ABG.
	- **Partial Pressure of Dissolved CO2**: CO2 production, respiratory quotient.

#### Scientifically-Correct Formula Explanation
- **Detailed Components**:
	- **PaO2 (Alveolar Oxygen)**: Total pO2 entering alveoli, total pO2 leaving alveoli.
	- **Additional Considerations**: CO2 absorbed in alveoli, metabolic CO2 release.

# Pneumonia

## Pathogenesis

1. **Initial Factors:**
	- Smoking → Suppressed neutrophil function and damaged lung epithelium.
	- Chronic lung conditions (COPD, asthma, lung cancer) → Destroyed lung tissue and impaired defense mechanisms.
	- Immune suppression (HIV, sepsis, glucocorticoids, chemotherapy) → Suppression of immune response.
	- Pathogen exposure via inhalation, aspiration, contiguous or haematological mechanisms.

2. **Microbial Proliferation:**
	- Susceptible host and/or virulent pathogen.
	- Proliferation of microbe in bronchioles and alveoli.

3. **Local Inflammatory Response:**
	- Alveolar epithelial cells release chemokines → Recruit neutrophils to the site of inflammation.
	- Systemic inflammatory responses towards invading microbe.
	- Systemic cytokine release → Disruption in hypothalamic thermoregulation.

## Clinical Findings

1. **Fever:**
	- Fever and chills/rigors due to systemic inflammatory response.

2. **Cough and Sputum:**
	- Productive cough and consolidation on CXR.
	- Irritation and attempted clearance of airways.
	- Fluid infiltrates alveoli, leading to phlegm production.
	- Fluid buildup restricts airflow, visible on X-rays.

3. **Shortness of Breath:**
	- Dyspnea due to alveolar sacs blocked by fluid accumulation.
	- Hypoxemia from impaired exchange of CO₂ and O₂.
	- Thickening of alveolar walls → Diffusion distance increases.
	- Inflammatory responses trigger peripheral and central chemoreceptors.

4. **Other Signs and Symptoms:**
	- Accessory muscle use, crackles on auscultation, fatigue.

5. **Notes:**
	- Pathogens can be bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.
	- Pneumonia classified by infection type and exposure: community-acquired, healthcare-associated, hospital-acquired.

# COVID

## Type L

- **Presentation:**
	- Early in presentation.
	- Low elastance (normal compliance).
	- Low V/Q (loss of HPV, low PAP).
	- Low lung weight (minor ground-glass opacities on CT).
	- Low lung recruitability (lungs mostly well-aerated).

## Type H

- **Presentation:**
	- Evolves later.
	- High elastance (low compliance) due to edema.
	- High shunt (perfusion of edematous units).

## Pathophysiology

#### Type L

1. **Initial Effects:**

	- Tachypnea, high minute ventilation, very negative transpulmonary pressure.

#### Type H

1. **Progression:**
	- Exudative edema, diffuse alveolar damage.
	- Proliferation of fibroblasts.
	- Exacerbated by vasoplegia.
	- Vessel stretch with increased perfusion and hydrostatic edema.
	- Thrombotic microangiopathy → Exudative ARDS.

## Complications in COVID-ARDS

	- CPAP may be helpful.

### Intubation Considerations

- **Type L:**
	
	- Avoid spontaneous breathing (exacerbating P-SILI).
	- Lower PEEP, sedation/paralysis.
	- Proning less helpful.
- **Type H:**
	
	- Higher PEEP, proning useful.
	- ECMO may be necessary.
	- Conventional ARDS treatment.
# D02/V02

## Tissue Perfusion Evaluation and Management

### Oxygen Delivery (DO₂)

- **DO₂ = Cardiac Output × Oxygen Content of Blood**
  - DO₂= (Heart Rate x Stroke Volume) x (1.34 x Hb x SaO2 + dissolved 02)
  - **Inadequate DO₂** may result from:
	- Global low cardiac output
	- Inadequate perfusion pressure to pressure-sensitive organs
	- Inadequate Hb
	- Inadequate SaO₂
- Simply meeting the default target ranges for A, B, C may be inadequate in certain patients.
  - **Ask:** "Is enough oxygen actually reaching the tissues in this patient at the moment?"
	- This is a quality-control evaluation step.

### Evaluate Markers of Successful Tissue Perfusion

- **Brain:**
  - Level of consciousness improving
- **Kidneys:**
  - Urine output present and improving
  - **Note:** Not independently reliable, especially if renal injury has already occurred
- **Peripheral Tissues:**
  - Warm
  - Short capillary refill time
- **Tissues:**
  - **Lactate Level:**
	- Assume Type A acidosis unless there is a good reason (metformin, ARVs, known dead tissue present) to suspect Type B.
	- With adequate resuscitation, lactate should progressively decline, ideally to <2 mmol/L.
	- Repeat arterial lactates every 4 hours during early resuscitation period.
	- May show initial rise in first 4 hours of successful resuscitation (toxin washout during reperfusion).
	- Failure to decline after >8-12 hours despite best possible resuscitation may imply:
	  - Organ failure/mitochondrial death
	  - Absence of identifiable local ischemic tissue (e.g., mesenteric ischemia) may imply mortality inevitable.
  - **SvO₂:**
	- Only valid in the first 6 hours (before mitochondrial death likely).
	- Improvement from low levels to 70%-75% suggests adequate perfusion of tissues.
	- Levels above 80% suggest mitochondrial dysfunction.
  - **SmixedvenousO₂:**
	- Always more reliable if available (less sampling error).
  - **Metabolic Acidosis Progressively Resolving:**
	- Initial rise possible as per lactate discussion above.
	- Be aware of non-hypoperfusion causes of metabolic acidosis that confound assessment:
	  - Common: Hyperchloremia, azotemia.
- **Failure to improve tissue perfusion markers initially mandates more aggressive resuscitation, re-evaluation of assessment of shock mechanisms, and re-evaluation of target ranges.**
## Oxygen Cascade

- Gradual decline in the partial pressure of oxygen from the atmosphere to the mitochondria.

## Haemoglobin Molecule and The Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve

### Structure of Haemoglobin

- **Composition:**
	
	- Each haemoglobin molecule is composed of 4 globin chains.
	- Each globin chain contains a haem moiety.
	- More than 95% of adult haemoglobin consists of 2 alpha and 2 beta globin chains.
- **Conformational Change:**
	
	- Haemoglobin's structure can be altered by binding with oxygen, causing a conformational change.
	- This conformational change is responsible for the sigmoidal shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.

### Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve

- **Forms of Haemoglobin:**
	
	- R (relaxed) form
	- T (tense) form
- **Oxygen Affinity:**
	
	- In the fully deoxygenated state (T form), haemoglobin has a very low affinity for oxygen, reflected in the flat lower portion of the curve.
	- As each subsequent molecule of oxygen binds, the affinity for the next molecule increases. This is reflected in the steep portion of the curve.
	- Once haemoglobin is nearly fully saturated, few binding sites remain, leading to the flat portion of the curve at the top right.
	- When 3 molecules of oxygen have bound to haemoglobin (saturations around 75%), the affinity for the final molecule is approximately 300 times that of the first molecule.
- **Physiological Implications:**
	
	- Even if alveolar PO₂ drops slightly, haemoglobin will only desaturate to a small degree.
	- Haemoglobin's high affinity for oxygen facilitates diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane.
	- As oxygen diffuses into plasma and binds to haemoglobin, the partial pressure within the plasma remains low, maintaining a gradient for diffusion from the alveolus to the plasma and ultimately haemoglobin.

### Key Points

- The sigmoidal shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is due to the allosteric binding of oxygen to haemoglobin.
- The initial reluctance of haemoglobin to bind oxygen transitions to increased affinity as more oxygen molecules bind.
- This mechanism ensures efficient oxygen uptake and release under varying physiological conditions.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240214142627.png)
## Mixed Venous Saturations

- **Normal Circumstances:**
  - Venous blood returning to the lungs typically has a saturation of around 70%.
- **Oxygen Binding:**
  - It is effectively only the final molecule of oxygen that binds as blood transits through the lungs.
  - Venous blood returns to the lungs with an allosteric conformation primed for loading oxygen (R state).
- **P50 Reference Point:**
  - P50 is the partial pressure of oxygen at which haemoglobin is 50% saturated.
  - It is used to compare various positions of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve in response to changes in physiological conditions.
- **Factors Affecting the Curve:**
  - **Temperature:** Changes can cause shifts in the curve.
  - **pH:** Variations influence haemoglobin's oxygen affinity.
  - **2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (DPG):** Affects the allosteric binding and oxygen affinity.
  - **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):** Alters haemoglobin's oxygen affinity through small allosteric changes.

### Key Points
- Venous blood with 70% saturation indicates readiness for oxygen loading in the lungs.
- The P50 value helps assess changes in haemoglobin's oxygen affinity under different physiological conditions.
- Shifts in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve are influenced by temperature, pH, DPG, and CO₂, which cause small allosteric changes affecting oxygen binding.
## The Relationship between DO2 and VO2 in Health

![](Pasted%20image%2020240214143713.png)

- **VO₂ Definition:**
  - VO₂ reflects the rate at which oxygen is utilized by tissues or the organism as a whole.
  - Calculated via the Fick equation: VO₂ = CO x Ca02Cv02
	- CO: Cardiac Output
	- CaO₂: Arterial oxygen content of blood
	- CvO₂: Venous oxygen content of blood
- **Basal VO₂:**
  - At rest, basal VO₂ is approximately 3-4 ml O₂/kg/min.
- **Metabolic Demand and DO₂:**
  - Increases in metabolic demand trigger a neurohormonal response, causing a parallel increase in DO₂.
  - In acute settings, this is achieved by modulating CO and its distribution.
  - The body adjusts the flow (not the pump) by increasing:
	- Hb via erythropoietin production, iron mobilization, and release of new red cells from marrow.
	- Ventilatory drive via chemoreceptors to maintain saturation.
- **Supply Independent and Dependent Oxygen Consumption:**
  - At rest, DO₂ exceeds VO₂ by a factor of four. This buffer allows VO₂ to be maintained even if DO₂ is reduced, known as supply-independent oxygen consumption.
  - There is a limit to this tolerance. Beyond this limit, VO₂ decreases linearly as DO₂ is reduced, leading to supply-dependent oxygen consumption.
  - When this limit is reached, the body switches to anaerobic metabolism. Beyond a certain reduction in DO₂, cell death will occur.
- **Clinical Implications:**
  - Studies in thoracic surgery show that a peak VO₂ of 14 ml/kg/min predicts a good postoperative outcome.
	- This value represents about four times the metabolic requirements at rest (4 METs).
  - For general surgery, the optimal peak VO₂ is likely around 11 ml/kg/min.
	- This roughly equates to the ability to climb two flights of stairs without a break, often used as a practical test in daily clinical practice.

# CVP

## Reference Point and Zeroing
- The transducer should be zeroed at the level of the right atrium, specifically at the 4th intercostal space in the mid-axillary line (phlebostatic axis when supine).
- Pressure recordings should be taken at the base of the c-wave, at end expiration in the supine position, equating to right atrial pressure just prior to ventricular systole.

## Clinical Relevance
- With a competent tricuspid valve, right atrial pressure (equal to CVP in the SVC) should match right ventricular end-diastolic pressure and may predict preload if right ventricular compliance is normal.
- However, variations in right ventricular compliance and factors like intrinsic systolic and diastolic myocardial function, pulmonary vascular resistance, and positive pressure ventilation limit CVP's ability to predict fluid responsiveness.
- CVP should be used as a trend value, correlated with the individual clinical context.
- **Normal CVP**: 2–8 mmHg.

## CVP Waveform Components
- **a wave**: Increase in pressure due to right atrial contraction.
- **c wave**: Occurs in early systole; right ventricular contraction causes the tricuspid valve to bulge into the right atrium, causing a small CVP increase.
- **x descent**: Atrial relaxation and downward movement of the right atrium during right ventricular contraction, resulting in rapid right atrial filling.
- **v wave**: Continued venous return to the right atrium during ventricular systole; right atrial filling with a closed tricuspid valve.
- **y descent**: Decrease in CVP after the tricuspid valve opens, allowing blood to flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle.

## Abnormal CVP Waveforms
- **Atrial Fibrillation (AF)**: Loss of 'a' waves.
- **Third-Degree Heart Block**: Independent atrial and ventricular contractions cause occasional larger 'a' waves (cannon 'a' waves) when the atria contract against a closed tricuspid valve.
- **Tricuspid Regurgitation**: During ventricular systole, blood is ejected into the right atrium, increasing CVP and producing a 'giant v wave' that replaces the 'c' wave, 'x' descent, and 'v' wave.

### Waveform Summaries

1. **Atrial Fibrillation (AF) or Flutter**: Absence of 'a' wave.
2. **Tricuspid Regurgitation**: Fused 'c' and 'v' waves.
3. **Atrioventricular Dyssynchrony**: Fused 'a' and 'c' waves.
4. **Reduced Right Atrial Emptying**: Accentuated 'a' wave and attenuated 'y' wave.
5. **Pericardial Constriction**: Sharp 'x' and 'y' descents.

# Lines Management
## General Management

- **Daily Review**
	
	- All invasive devices, especially vascular catheters, drains, and urine catheters.
	- Remove non-functional drains, including non-swinging non-flushable intercostal drains.
- **Insertion Site Inspection**
	
	- Daily check for cleanliness.
	- Remove all invasive devices with obvious local sepsis.
	- Remove lines with contaminated segments (e.g., missing caps, fixed blood setback).
	- Remove dysfunctional invasive devices (e.g., overamped arterial line, central lines with occluded lumens).

## Urinary Catheter Management in Presence of Infection

- **Criteria**
	- Can it be removed, even if only temporarily?
	- Bladder washout with non-absorbable antibiotic (e.g., aminoglycoside)?
	- Antimicrobial-impregnated catheter?

## Vascular Catheter Removal

- **Criteria**
	- If complications occur from a line that is no longer strictly needed, it is medicolegally indefensible.
## Indications for Catheterization

- **Arterial Catheterization**
	
	- Need for beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring.
	- Poor anatomy for BP cuff.
	- Need for >3 arterial blood gases every day.
- **Central Venous Catheterization**
	
	- No/inadequate peripheral access.
	- Infusion of sclerosant fluids (e.g., TPN, vasoactive agents, chemotherapeutics).
	- Actual use of central venous pressures to guide therapy.
	- Need for repeated venous sampling.

## Default Change Dates for Vascular Catheters (Day of Placement = Day 0)

- Peripheral: Day 2.
- Arterial: Day 7.
- Central venous: Day 7.
- Renal dialysis lines: Day 10 (consider morbidity and availability of alternate site first).

### Changes

- Earlier changes are mandatory if catheters are dysfunctional or sepsis is present.
- Later changes permissible with consultant consent if poor vascular access/risk.

## Minimum Requirements for Placement of Long-Duration Catheters

- **Arterial Line**
	
	- Sterile procedure with 500mm draping around insertion site.

# Hyperoxia and Oxygen Therapy

## Pros and Cons of Oxygen Therapy

### Benefits
- Increased Tissue Oxygenation
- Improved Hypoxia Tolerance
- Enhanced Alveolar Macrophage Function
- Reduced Surgical Site Infections (SSI)
- Decreased Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)

### Risks
- **Neonates and Infants**:
  - **Increased Risk**:
	- Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD)
	- Ductus Arteriosus Patency
	- Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)
	- Atelectasis
	- Oligodendrocyte Apoptosis
	- Reduced Cerebral Blood Flow
	- Cerebral Vascular Ischemia
  - **Reduced Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)**
- **Children**:
  - **Increased Risk**:
	- Lung Damage
	- Contractile Function of Diaphragm
	- Airway Inflammation in COPD
	- Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD)
	- Neurodegenerative Disorders
	- Stroke Exacerbation
  - **Decreased**:
	- Coronary Arterial Flow
	- Ischemic Injury
	- Carotid Body Chemoreceptor Sensitivity
  - **Increased**:
	- Hyperoxia-induced Inflammation
  
## Target FiO2 (Fraction of Inspired Oxygen)
- **Neonates**: 21%
- **Infants**: 30%
- **Children**: 40%
- **Middle-aged**: 60%
- **Elderly**: 30%

## Definitions
- **Hyperoxia**: Excess oxygen supply (FiO2 > 0.21)
- **Normoxaemia**: PaO2 range between 80-100mmHg (10.6-13.3kPa) when breathing room air
- **Hyperoxaemia**: Elevated PaO2 (often >100mmHg). Varies between clinical studies, typically PaO2 >240kPa (300mmHg)

## Impact of Hyperoxaemia
1. **Microvasculature**: Hyperoxia induces vasoconstriction, altering microvascular perfusion.
2. **Lungs**: High FiO2 can cause ARDS-like lesions, increased capillary permeability, pulmonary edema, necrosis, increased mortality, and ventilator-free days.
3. **Retina**: Retinopathy of prematurity in neonates exposed to high FiO2.
4. **Coronary Arteries**: Hyperoxia linked with coronary arterial vasoconstriction, increased risk of myocardial infarction.
5. **Neonatal Resuscitation**: Lower mortality in neonates resuscitated with FiO2 0.21 vs. 1.0.
6. **Severe Traumatic Brain Injury**: Extreme hyperoxaemia associated with increased mortality.
7. **Post-Cardiac Arrest**: High PaO2 linked with poor neurological outcomes.

## Hyperoxia and Sepsis
- **Benefits**: Enhanced antimicrobial defense, vasoconstriction, attenuation of inflammatory response.
- **Animal Studies**: Showed benefits in porcine septic shock.
- **Human Studies**: HYPERS2S trial showed high FiO2 associated with increased mortality in septic shock patients.

## Hyperoxaemia and Haemodynamics
- Hyperoxaemia does not reverse sepsis-induced vasoplegia, increases systemic vascular resistance (SVR), but not in patients with preexisting conditions. Reduced cardiac output in affected patients.

## Limiting Oxygen
1. **Permissive Hypoxaemia**:
   - Strategy for lung protection, ARDS, Acute Lung Injury (ALI)
   - Target PaO2 values between 55-80mmHg (7.3-10.6kPa)
2. **Precise Control of Arterial Oxygenation (PCAO)**:
   - Aim to control blood oxygen levels precisely to prevent hyperoxaemia.

## How Much is Too Much?
1. **Duration of Hyperoxaemia**: Longer exposure correlates with increased risk.
2. **Degree of Hyperoxaemia**: Higher levels associated with adverse outcomes.

## Evidence for Cutting Back
- Studies indicate conservative oxygen therapy may reduce mortality and improve outcomes.
- Trials like Oxygen-ICU show benefits of targeting lower FiO2 levels.

## How to Administer Oxygen in Critically Ill
- **No Lung Injury**: SpO2 95-96%
- **ARDS**: SpO2 82-88%
- **Avoid Hyperoxaemia**: SpO2 >97%, PaO2 >100mmHg (13.3kPa)

## Recommendations
- Avoid overshooting into hyperoxaemia.
- Personalized oxygen therapy may benefit some patients.
- Careful monitoring and targeted oxygen delivery are crucial.
# Red Cell Transfusion Triggers in ICU

## Introduction

Red cell transfusions are lifesaving in active bleeding and severe anaemia. In critically ill patients, red cell transfusion is used to increase oxygen delivery and tissue oxygenation.

- **Incidence:** 37-45% of ICU patients receive ≥1 unit of packed red cells.
- **Efficacy:** Increases in oxygen content do not significantly improve oxygen delivery (DO₂) or oxygen utilisation.
- **Stored vs. Circulating Red Cells:** Autologous stored red cells differ from circulating red cells, often poorly deformable and passing through microcirculation with difficulty.
- **Complications:** Transfusions are associated with:
	- Infection
	- Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)
	- Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)
	- Transfusion-mediated immunomodulation (TRIM)

**Long-term Evidence:** Neonatal red cell transfusions can have immunological evidence even 30 years later.

## Transfusion Trials

### Critically Ill

#### TRICC Trial (Hebert 1999)

- **Objective:** Question transfusion requirements in critically ill patients.
- **Design:** Randomized controlled trial of 838 euvolemic patients not actively bleeding, Hb <9g/dL within 72 hours of ICU admission.
	- **Liberal arm:** Transfused if Hb <10g/dL, maintain Hb of 10-12g/dL.
	- **Restrictive arm:** Transfused if Hb <7g/dL, maintain Hb of 7-9g/dL.
- **Outcome:** Lower 30-day mortality in the restrictive group (18.7% vs. 23.3%, p=0.11).
	- **Significant findings:**
		- Reduced mortality in less sick patients (APACHE 2 scores ≤20) [18.7% vs. 16.1%, p=0.03]
		- Reduced mortality in younger patients (<55 years) [5.7% vs. 13.0%, p=0.02]
		- Lower in-hospital mortality [22.2% vs. 28.1%, p=0.05]
	- **Non-significant trends:**
		- Lower mortality in patients with cardiac disease [20.5% vs. 22.9%, p=0.69]
		- More frequent cardiac events in the liberal strategy [p<0.01]

**Conclusion:** Restrictive transfusion strategy is at least as effective and possibly superior in the critically ill, except for active coronary ischaemic syndromes.

#### TRISS Trial (Holst 2014)

- **Objective:** Evaluate transfusion triggers in septic shock.
- **Design:** 998 septic shock patients, Hb ≤9g/dL.
	- **Restrictive arm:** Transfused if Hb ≤7g/dL.
	- **Liberal arm:** Transfused if Hb ≤9g/dL.
- **Outcome:** Mortality at 90 days was not significantly different. No difference in health-related quality of life.

**Follow-up (2016):** No difference in 1-year mortality rates, confirming safety of restrictive transfusion strategy in sepsis.

#### Meta-analysis (Salpeter 2014)

- **Included Studies:** 3 trials of 4500 critically ill/bleeding patients.
- **Findings:**
	- Less rebleeding, bacterial infection, in-hospital mortality, total mortality with restrictive targets.
	- No significant benefit or harm observed.

**Conclusion:** While some studies do not show a benefit for restrictive triggers, red cell transfusions are lifesaving and should be reserved for situations with positive impact.

### Cardiac Surgery

#### TRICS III Trial (Mazer 2017)

- **Objective:** Evaluate transfusion triggers in cardiac surgery.
- **Design:** Randomized patients to Hb <7.5g/dL (restrictive) vs. <9.5g/dL (liberal) in ICU or <8.5g/dL in the ward.
- **Outcome:**
	- Primary composite outcome: No difference.
	- Subgroup: Restrictive strategy reduced primary composite outcome in elderly patients ≥75 years [OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.54-0.89].

### Paediatrics

#### TRIPICU Trial (Lacroix 2015)

- **Objective:** Evaluate transfusion triggers in paediatric intensive care.
- **Design:** Randomized patients to Hb <7g/dL vs. Hb <9.5g/dL.
- **Outcome:** No benefit in surgical, septic, or cardiac patients. Recommendations are emerging to transfuse if Hb <5g/dL or evidence of haemorrhagic shock.

**Observations:** Higher complication rates in children. Greatest mortality in critically ill children who are less sick.

### Perioperative Patients

#### Meta-analysis (Chong 2018)

- **Included Data:** 27 trials of transfusion triggers in critically ill/perioperative patients.
- **Findings:** Restrictive strategy reduced mortality in critically ill patients but not perioperative patients.

### Perioperative Blood Management

- **Core Concepts:**
	1. **Managing anaemia:** Early detection, minimising oxygen consumption, pharmacological therapy.
	2. **Conservation modalities:** Surgical techniques, minimise blood use.
	3. **Optimising haemostasis:** Coagulation status, goal-directed therapy.
	4. **Patient-centred decision making:** Informing patients of risks, benefits, and alternatives.

## Summary

### Key Conclusions

1. Restrictive strategies do not appear to harm critically ill patients.
2. Consider transfusions if Hb <7g/dL in critically ill.
3. Do not use transfusions to increase oxygen delivery.
4. Target Hb <8g/dL for acute coronary syndromes and cardiac surgery.
5. Hb <6g/dL for paediatric critically ill patients.
6. Hb <8g/dL for post-operative high-risk patients.
7. Employ precision medicine, assessing each case individually.

**Note:** Transfusion triggers must be assessed based on individual patient needs, risks, and benefits of autologous transfusion.
