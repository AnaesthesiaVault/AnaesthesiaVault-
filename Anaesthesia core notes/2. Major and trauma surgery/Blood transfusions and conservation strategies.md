# Intra-operative Blood Transfusions
- NICE recommends a restrictive* approach: threshold of Hb ≤7-8 or Hct ≤25%
- 4 mL/kg PRBC will ↑ Hb by 1g/dL (calculate in patients < 50kg ← risk of TACO)
- More liberal approach in the elderly may produce better 30 and 90d mortality outcomes (Hb 9-12)
- Suggest threshold of 8 in patients with acute coronary syndrome
- Decision should be individualized, considering patient's clinical condition and rate of blood loss
- No difference in mobility, myocardial infarction, death and length of stay compared to liberal strategy (Carson et al.)
- Restrictive is superior in critical illness and GI haemorrhage, non-inferior after hip fracture repair (10.1016/j.mpaic.2019.01.006)  
- Murphy et al showed worse outcome when restrictive strategy was used in cardiac surgery
## Blood Products

### Components and Indications

- **FFP**: All clotting factors; 15 ml/kg (20-30% correction)
- **Cryoprecipitate**: I, VIII, XIII, vWF; 5 ml/kg
- **Random Donor Platelet (RDP)**: Platelet count > 5.5 x 10^10; 1 unit/10 kg
- **Single Donor Platelet (SDP)**: Platelet count > 3 x 10^11; 1 collection = 6 RDP
- **Whole Blood**: Acute blood loss, severe trauma
### Leukodepletion Vs Irradiation of Blood

[View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.](https://whimsical.com/leukodepletion-vs-irradiation-of-blood-8TqtR7fMZ11FMVBoKyWWLw?ref=chatgpt)

## Maximum Allowable Blood Loss (ABL)

**Formula for ABL Calculation:** ABL=EBV×(Hi−Hf)/Hi

**Where:**

- **EBV** = Estimated Blood Volume
- **Hi** = Initial Hemoglobin
- **Hf** = Final Hemoglobin

### Calculation of Estimated Blood Volume (EBV)

EBV=Body Weight (kg)×Average Blood Volume (ml/kg)

### Average Blood Volumes by Patient Category

- **Premature Neonates:** 95 mL/kg
- **Full Term Neonates:** 85 mL/kg
- **Infant:** 80 mL/kg
- **Adult Men:** 75 mL/kg
- **Adult Women:** 65 mL/kg

### Normal Hematocrit (Hct) Values

- **Men:** 42-52%
- **Women:** 37-47%

### Special Considerations

- For obese patients, using the Ideal Body Weight (IBW) or Adjusted Body Weight (ABW) instead of the actual weight provides more accurate calculations.

## Complications

### Acute (within 24 hours)

- Acute haemolytic reactions
- Allergic reactions
- Bacterial contamination
- Febrile non-haemolytic reactions
- Transfusion-related acute lung injury
- Transfusion-associated circulatory overload

### Early (within 2 weeks)

- Delayed haemolytic reactions
- Post-transfusion purpura
- Transfusion-induced immunomodulation
#### Antibody-Mediated Transfusion Reactions

- **Acute Haemolytic Reactions**: Immediate; intravascular haemolysis; stop transfusion, supportive management
- **Delayed Haemolytic Reactions**: 24 hrs to 10 days; extravascular haemolysis; supportive management
- **Allergic Reactions**: Immediate; non-haemolytic; antihistamines
- **Anaphylaxis**: Immediate; non-haemolytic; manage with anaphylaxis protocol
- **Febrile Non-Haemolytic Reactions**: During transfusion; cytokine accumulation; antipyretics

#### Transfusion-related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)
**• Characterized by** acute respiratory distress within 6h of transfusion
**• Present with** acute dyspnea, hypoxia, fever, hypotension
**• CXR:** Bilateral pulmonary infiltration
**• ΔΔ:** Transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO); Transfusion associated dyspnea (TAD)
**• Rx:** Supportive - ventilation if req. Diuretics worsen. 
**• Most resolve** within 72h with no long term consequences
#### Transfusion-associated Circulatory Overload (TACO)

### Late (after 2 weeks)

- Transmission of infection
- Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease
- Transfusion iron overload
- Alloimmunization
## Reducing Need for Transfusion

### Preoperative Optimization

- Identify and treat anaemia
- Assess bleeding risk (history, coagulation screen)
- Discontinue anticoagulants if possible

### Minimizing Blood Loss at Surgery

- Use blood-sparing surgical techniques
- Apply antifibrinolytic drugs and intraoperative cell salvage procedures

### Avoiding Unnecessary Transfusion Post-Surgery

- Use restrictive transfusion thresholds
- Minimize blood loss from tests
- Use iron/stimulants to boost red cell production
# Massive Transfusion Protocol

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314172921.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314172952.png)

## MT Criteria

1. Transfusion of ≥10 RBC units within 24 hours
2. Transfusion of >4 RBC units in 1 hour with continued need anticipated
3. Replacement of >50% of total blood volume (TBV) within 3 hours
## Complications Specific to Massive Transfusion (complete Replacement of the Circulating Blood Volume in 24 h)
- Hypothermia
- Dilutional coagulopathy if inadequate coagulation factors replaced relative to packed red cells
- Hyperkalemia
- Citrate toxicity resulting in hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia

# Paeds Blood Transfusion

**Transfusion Volume** = EBV × (Ideal haematocrit − current haematocrit)/0.6* 

**Ideal Hct** 

- Healthy and older: Hct 20%  
- Prem and sick neonates: Hct 40%  
5 ml/kg of PRBC (Hct 0.6) will raise Hb by 1 g/dl

### Estimated Blood Volume in Pediatrics

#### Volume per Age Group

- Premature infant: 90-100 ml/kg
- Term infant: 80-90 ml/kg
- Older children: 70-80 ml/kg
- Over 2 years: 70 ml/kg
- Very obese children: 65 ml/kg

#### Maximum Allowable Blood Loss (MABL) Calculation

- MABL = EBV x (Hbi - Hbt) / Hb av
	- EBV: Estimated Blood Volume
	- Hbi: Initial Haemoglobin
	- Hbt: Threshold Haemoglobin
	- Hb av: Average Haemoglobin (Hbi + Hbt) / 2
## Massive Transfusion Protocol in Paediatrics

### Definition of Massive Transfusion

- **>50% Total Blood Volume (TBV) in 3 hours**
- **100% TBV in 24 hours**
- **>10% TBV per minute**
- **>40 mL/kg**

### Protocol

- **Ratio:** 1:1:1 of RBC:FFP (2:1:1 also acceptable)
- **FFP:** Minimal to no improvement in abnormal coagulation tests; increased risk of VTE.
- **Cryoprecipitate (Cryo):** No dilutional effect; quicker availability than FFP; reduces blood product requirements in craniosynostosis surgery.
- **Fresh Whole Blood:** No evidence of benefit during massive transfusion.
- **Recombinant Factor VII (RFVII):** No benefit in severe trauma or as part of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP).
- **POC Testing:** No evidence of improved morbidity or mortality.

## Transfusion Thresholds

### General Guidelines

- **Hb of 7 g/dL** is well-tolerated by term neonates, infants, children, and adolescents, including those with less or more severe illness, undergoing non-cardiac surgery, or cardiac surgery in patients with acyanotic heart disease.

### Special Considerations

- **More liberal strategy warranted in:**
	- Active bleeding
	- Hemodynamic instability
	- Acute brain injury
	- Cyanotic heart disease
	- Preterm neonates

### RBC Transfusion Thresholds

- **<4 months:** Various conditions (e.g., preterm, chronic oxygen dependency); thresholds range from 7-14 g/dL.
- **>4 months:**
	- Stable infant: 7 g/dL
	- Critically unwell: 7-8 g/dL
	- Perioperative bleeding: 9 g/dL
	- Cyanotic heart disease: 9 g/dL
	- Thalassemia major: 9 g/dL
	- Sickle cell disease: 7-9 g/dL

### Platelet Transfusion Thresholds

- **Neonate with bleeding:** 50 x 10^9/L
- **Sick neonate:** 30 x 10^9/L
- **Stable neonate:** 20 x 10^9/L
- **Infant/child:** 10 x 10^9/L
- **ICU patients:** 20 x 10^9/L

### FFP/Cryoprecipitate

- **Neonate/child with bleeding, DIC, or invasive procedure:** APTT/PT > 1.5x control, fibrinogen < 1 g/L

[View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.](https://whimsical.com/estimation-of-blood-loss-7WZZwEmeCmFcx4H4AL9Xtd?ref=chatgpt)

## Increased Risk for Transfusion

### Factors Increasing Transfusion Risk (>3x Odds)

- Age < 1 year
- ASA class IV
- High procedure risk
- Pre-operative septic shock
- Pre-operative cardiopulmonary resuscitation

### Anemia and Transfusion Risk

- Anemia (iron deficiency) is common in 40% of children.
- Preoperative anemia increases the risk of transfusion.
## TBV Estimation: Gilcher's Rule of Five for Blood Volume

### Total Blood Volume (TBV) Estimation for Adults (in ml/kg Body weight)

#### Males

- **Fat**: 60 ml/kg
- **Thin**: 65 ml/kg
- **Normal**: 70 ml/kg
- **Muscular**: 75 ml/kg

#### Females

- **Fat**: 55 ml/kg
- **Thin**: 60 ml/kg
- **Normal**: 65 ml/kg
- **Muscular**: 70 ml/kg
# Cell Saver

## Characteristics

- **Contains RBC only:** Coagulation factors will be needed if a large volume is used (administer 1:1 thawed FFP).

## Indications

- **Massive hemorrhage:** When blood loss is expected to exceed 10% of circulating volume.
- **Refusal of allogenic transfusion:** Patients who refuse allogenic blood transfusion (e.g., Jehovah's Witnesses) may accept cell salvage.
- **Crossmatched blood not available:** Cell salvage is useful when crossmatched blood is unavailable.

## Contraindications

- **Patient refusal:** If the patient or guardian refuses the procedure.
- **Aspiration of toxic substances:** If the aspirated blood contains toxic substances (e.g., peroxide).
- **Contaminated tissue:** If the tissue is contaminated with metallosis or other contaminants.
## Special Considerations

- **Bacterial infection and malignancy:** Use is determined on a case-by-case basis, weighing the risks and benefits.
- **Hemoglobinopathies:** Requires consultation with hematology for advice.
- **Obstetrics (Obs):** Concerns about Amniotic Fluid Embolism (Safe) and Rhesus incompatibility issues need to be addressed.
- **Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW):** Cell salvage may be acceptable if the circuit remains in continuity with the patient's body, thus not breaking the "blood loop."

## Advantage and Disadvantages of Cell save
