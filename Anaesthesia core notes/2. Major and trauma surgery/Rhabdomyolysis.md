# Rhabdomyolysis

## Introduction
- Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by skeletal muscle disintegration and the release of myoglobin and other intercellular proteins and electrolytes into the circulation.
- Creatine kinase (CK) levels are markedly elevated, and muscle pain and myoglobinuria may occur.
- **Clinical Presentation:**
  - Severe pain may limit passive limb movement and reduce the range of active movement.

### Causes of Rhabdomyolysis

#### Traumatic
- **Crush injury and trauma:** Earthquakes, collapsed buildings, road traffic collisions.
- **Compartment syndrome:** Alcohol-associated immobility, prolonged collapse, perioperative positioning, prolonged tourniquet use.
- **Electrocution**

#### Non-traumatic
- **Exertional:** Strenuous exercise, seizures.
- **Body temperature changes:** Malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, hypothermia.
- **Genetic defects:** Ranging from disorders of glycolysis or gluconeogenesis to disorders of the mitochondria.
- **Drugs or toxins:** Statins, alcohol, heroin, cocaine.
- **Infections:** Influenza A and B, EBV, HIV, _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Staphylococcus aureus_.
- **Metabolic and electrolyte disorders:** Non-ketotic hyperosmotic state, diabetic ketoacidosis.
- **Idiopathic**

## Pathophysiology
- Rhabdomyolysis involves either direct sarcolemmic injury (usually trauma) or depletion of ATP within the myocyte. ATP stores maintain the ionic gradients across the cell membrane, including the calcium ATPase pumps.
- Depletion of ATP impairs the function of these pumps and results in increased sarcoplasmic calcium levels, leading to persistent contraction of the myofibril. This sustained contraction leads to further energy depletion, activation of calcium-dependent neutral proteases and phospholipases, and the eventual disintegration of the myocyte.

### Metabolic Derangements
- After myocyte injury, intracellular contents are released into the circulation.
- Hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia can all develop rapidly.
  - High levels of phosphate bind to calcium, and calcium-phosphate deposition can occur in soft tissue. Additionally, calcium is lost from the serum by entering damaged muscle cells, resulting in hypocalcemia.
- Ischemic muscle is forced to utilize anaerobic metabolism via the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, and a metabolic acidosis may occur.
- The combination of hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and acidosis is particularly dangerous.
- Hyperuricemia is caused by the metabolism of purines from disintegrated cell nuclei.
- During the recovery phase of rhabdomyolysis, about one-third of patients develop hypercalcemia. This may occur due to the release of vitamin D stores from injured muscle, providing substrate for the production of excess 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
  - Hypercalcemia may be further exacerbated if excess calcium is administered during the acute hypocalcemic phase.
- Myoglobin is a dark red heme-containing protein that stores and transports oxygen in muscle. Only small levels of myoglobin are normally present in plasma.

### Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
- During intensive care, the reported incidence of AKI after rhabdomyolysis may be as high as 65%.
- Multiple mechanisms:
  - Tubular obstruction, direct and ischemic tubular injury, and intrarenal vasoconstriction.
  - Within the renal tubules, myoglobin interacts with the protein Tamm-Horsfall to form brown granular casts, resulting in tubular obstruction. This process is favored when the urine is acidic, and myoglobin may have no nephrotoxic effect when the urine is alkaline.
## Investigations

### Investigations in Rhabdomyolysis

| **Investigation**              | **Possible Findings**                   |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Creatine kinase                | >5000 units litre<sup>−1</sup>          |
| Serum and urine myoglobin      | Present                                 |
| Urinary dipstick + pH          | Positive for blood                      |

| Coagulation studies            | Prolonged in severe cases               |
| Blood gas                      | Lactic acidosis                         |
| Calculation of anion gap       | Raised                                  |
| ECG                            | Changes of hyperkalemia                 |

## Management
1. **Addressing the underlying etiology**
2. **IV fluid** with goal urine output of 250-300 mL/hour. Either balanced solutions (RL, Plas L, etc.) or 0.9% normal saline can be used in the initial stages.
3. **Correct electrolytes**
4. **Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)** may be needed in those with severe renal injury or electrolyte abnormalities.
5. **Bicarbonate, mannitol, and loop diuretics** do not improve outcomes based on the literature.
	- If bicarbonate is used (theoretical advantage):
		- Sodium bicarbonate may be administered as boluses of 50–100 mmol or as 1.26% to aid in volume resuscitation. An advantage of the administration of 1.26% sodium bicarbonate is the avoidance of the hyperchloremic acidosis associated with large volumes of sodium chloride infusion. A target urinary pH of >6.5 should be achieved.
