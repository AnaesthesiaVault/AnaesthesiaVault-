# Tetanus
## Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

### Introduction

- **Tetanus**, also known as **lockjaw**, is a bacterial infection characterized by muscle spasms.
	
	- Spasms typically begin in the jaw and progress to the rest of the body.
	- Each spasm lasts a few minutes, occurring frequently for three to four weeks.
	- Severe spasms can cause bone fractures.
	- Other symptoms include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate.
	- Onset of symptoms is usually 3-21 days post-infection.
	- Recovery may take months; about 10% of cases are fatal.
- **Cause**: Infection with the bacterium _Clostridium tetani_, found in soil, saliva, dust, and manure (gram-positive).
	
	- Entry is usually through a break in the skin such as a cut or puncture wound by a contaminated object.

### Pathogenesis

1. **C. tetani spores invade damaged human tissue.**
2. **C. tetani transforms into a vegetative bacterium and produces tetanus toxin (TT).**
3. **TT undergoes retrograde axonal transport to the spinal cord and brain stem.**
4. **TT binds receptors and blocks neurotransmission on membrane proteins involved in neuroexocytosis.**
5. **↓ modulation of excitatory impulses from motor cortex, anterior horn cell, and autonomic neurons.**
6. **Tetanus: Nervous system disorder characterized by muscle spasm and rigidity.**

### Clinical Manifestations

- **Cephalic Tetanus**
	
	- Caused by penetrating head and/or neck injury.
	- _C. tetani_ invasion of cranial nerve VII and occasionally III, IV, VI, XII.
	- Results in **cranial nerve palsies**.
- **Localized Tetanus**
	
	- Dysfunction in local muscle interneurons that inhibit alpha motor neurons.
	- Results in **rigidity in muscle group near infected site**.
- **Generalized Tetanus**
	
	- ↓ control of catecholamine release.
	- Hypersympathetic state leading to diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension.
	- ↑ resting firing rate of motor neurons and ↓ inhibition of reflex motor responses to afferent sensory stimuli.
	- Results in **generalized muscle spasms and rigidity** leading to:
		- **Exhaustion**
		- **Respiratory failure**
		- **Aspiration**
- **Neonatal Tetanus**
	
	- Umbilical cord contamination with _C. tetani_ after unsanitary delivery.
	- Results in **poor feeding, irritability**.

### Notes

- _C. tetani_ (Clostridium tetani) is an obligate anaerobe found in soil and the gut of mammals.
- Localized and cephalic tetanus may eventually progress to generalized tetanus.

### Clinical Diagnosis

- Diagnosis is based on presenting signs and symptoms, characterized by a triad of muscle rigidity, muscle spasms, and autonomic instability (salivation, sweating, ↑ bronchial secretions, pyrexia, gastric stasis, ileus).
- Cardiovascular manifestations include:
	- ↑ Sympathetic tone → tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction.
	- Autonomic storms from ↑ catecholamine levels.
	- Alternates with episodes of sudden hypotension, bradycardia, asystole.

## Ablett Classification of Tetanus Severity

- **Grade 1 (Mild)**
	
	- Mild trismus, general spasticity, no respiratory compromise, no spasms, no dysphagia.
- **Grade 2 (Moderate)**
	
	- Moderate trismus, rigidity, short spasms, mild dysphagia, moderate respiratory involvement, ventilatory frequency >30.
- **Grade 3 (Severe)**
	
	- Severe trismus, generalized rigidity, prolonged spasms, severe dysphagia, apnoeic spells, pulse >120, ventilatory frequency >40.
- **Grade 4 (Very Severe)**
	
	- Grade 3 with severe autonomic instability.

## Differential Diagnosis of Tetanus

- Hypocalcaemic tetany
- Epilepsy
- Chorea
- Meningitis
- Encephalitis
- Subarachnoid haemorrhage
- Strychnine poisoning
- Rabies
- Sepsis
- Drug withdrawal

## Pathophysiology

- Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) binds to the presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, is internalized, and transported back through the axon to the central nervous system.
- It selectively binds to and is transported into inhibitory neurons via endocytosis, cleaving vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) synaptobrevin, which is necessary for membrane fusion of small synaptic vesicles (SSVs).
- SSVs carry neurotransmitter to the membrane for release, so inhibition of this process blocks neurotransmitter release.
- Tetanus toxin blocks the release of neurotransmitters GABA and glycine from inhibitory neurons.
- This results in overactive motor neurons firing out of control, causing muscle spasms and spastic paralysis.

### Mechanism of Action

1. Binding to the neuron.
2. Internalization of the toxin.
3. Membrane translocation.
4. Cleavage of the target VAMP.

## Management

1. **Neutralization of unbound toxin**: Human Tetanoid Immunoglobulin + Tetanus toxoid.
2. **Surgical debridement ± antibiotics**: Metronidazole for 10 days.
3. **Control of muscle rigidity and spasm**: Benzodiazepines ± Morphine ± Anticonvulsants ± Neuromuscular blockers ± Intrathecal baclofen.
4. **Supportive care**: Nutrition, sedation, VTE prophylaxis, infection prevention.
5. **Cardiovascular support**:
	- Sedation with Morphine → ↓ catecholamine output.
	- Clonidine/Dexmedetomidine: ↓ sympathetic outflow, arterial pressure, heart rate, and catecholamine release.
	- Magnesium sulfate: blocks catecholamine release from nerves and adrenals, ↓ receptor responsiveness to catecholamines, presynaptic neuromuscular blockade.
	- High-dose Atropine if bradycardia is a feature → counteracts parasympathetic overactivity (anticholinergic).

### Severe Tetanus

1. ICU admission.
2. Intubation and ventilation (tracheostomy may be needed as ETT can trigger spasms).
3. Magnesium sulfate for spasm and autonomic dysfunction (consider clonidine or dexmedetomidine).
4. Continuous infusion of diazepam/NG tube; intrathecal baclofen can be administered.
5. Management of autonomic dysreflexia (hyper/hypotension; hyperpyrexia) with labetalol, magnesium, clonidine, nifedipine.
6. Use of muscle relaxants.
7. Debridement of infected tissue.
8. Nutritional support.
9. Metronidazole administration.
10. Tetanus toxoid administration to eliminate spores before they attack neurons.
