## Background

- **Procedures**: Lobectomy, segmentectomy, wedge resection
- **Indications**: Hepatic metastases, benign and malignant primary hepato-biliary tumors, liver donation for transplantation, trauma
- **Liver Anatomy**: Highly vascular, receives 25% of cardiac output, 80% of blood supply via portal vein, 20% via hepatic artery
- **Risks**: Increased risk of multi-organ dysfunction if underlying hepatic disease

## Considerations

- **Potential for Massive Blood Loss**
	- Need for invasive monitors and access
	- Increased risk in cases of:
		- Repeat surgery
		- Porta hepatis lesions
		- Lesions near large vessels
		- Large resections
		- Portal hypertension
		- Right-sided resections
- **Postoperative Risks**
	- Liver dysfunction and coagulopathy
	- Hypoglycemia during vascular occlusion and post-resection
	- Altered drug metabolism with liver dysfunction
	- Decreased cardiac output and increased LV afterload during temporary blood supply occlusion
	- Transient IVC compression and decreased venous return due to surgical manipulation
- **Potential Co-Morbidities**
	- Cancer-related issues (mass effects, medications, metastases, metabolic abnormalities)
	- Liver disease, alcohol abuse, hepatitis C, carcinoid

## Goals and Conflicts

- **Overall Goals**: Avoid and manage postoperative liver dysfunction, minimize blood loss, avoid hepatotoxins

## Preoperative

- **Assessment**
	- Evaluate cardiopulmonary function to tolerate surgery
	- Focused history and examination (pathology, planned surgery, comorbidities, baseline liver function)
	- Routine tests: FBC, U&E, LFT, Coags
	- Special tests: PFT, ABG, ECHO
	- PHLF screening: CT/MRI volumetric analysis, Indocyanine green clearance
- **Risk Stratification**
	- Assess risk of postoperative liver failure based on resection extent and underlying liver disease
	- Safe resection limits: 50-80% liver removal in young patients with normal liver
	- Increased risk with significant alcohol consumption
	- Extent of liver disease assessment: Child-Pugh B and C (likely contraindicated for liver resection)
	- Preoperative portal vein embolization to induce liver hypertrophy if necessary

## Intraoperative

- **Monitoring and Access**
	- BP, CVC, CO monitoring, TOE, large bore IV lines, blood products, cell salvage, temperature management
- **Drug Management**
	- Use Desflurane/Isoflurane, Atracurium/Cisatracurium
	- Avoid hepatotoxic drugs
- **Hemodynamics**
	- Total hepatic vascular exclusion (THVE) vs selective hepatic vascular exclusion (SHVE)
	- Minimize CVP to reduce blood loss:
		- Limited pre-resection IV fluids (max 1 ml/kg/hr)
		- Vasopressors to maintain perfusion pressure
		- Reverse Trendelenburg positioning, diuretics, NTG infusion, minimize PEEP
- **Surgical Techniques**
	- Intraoperative ultrasound for tumor detection and resection planning
	- Consider TXA
	- Maintain normothermia, normal pH, normal Ca2+, normoglycemia
	- Monitor and correct coagulopathy
	- Consider N-acetylcysteine for ischemia-reperfusion injury (mixed evidence)
- **Pain Management**
	- Thoracic epidural cautiously considered due to risk of postoperative coagulopathy
	- Alternatives: single-shot neuraxial opioids, IV opioid PCA, continuous wound infusion catheters

### Hepatic Vascular Occlusion Techniques and Hemodynamics

**Inflow and Outflow Occlusion:**

- **THVE:**
	- Heart rate: ↑↑ (50%)
	- Mean arterial pressure: ↓↓↓
	- Systemic vascular resistance: ↑↑↑ (80%)
	- Cardiac output: ↓↓↓ (60%)
- **SHVE:**
	- Heart rate: ↑ (2-5%)
	- Mean arterial pressure: ↑
	- Systemic vascular resistance: ↑
	- Cardiac output: ↓

**Inflow Occlusion:**

- Heart rate: ↑↑
- Mean arterial pressure: ↑↑ (15%)
- Systemic vascular resistance: ↑↑ (40%)
- Cardiac output: ↓ (10%)

**Hepatic Pedicle Occlusion (Pringle Manoeuvre):**

- Continuous or intermittent occlusion of portal vein and hepatic artery

**Selective Inflow Occlusion:**

- Hemihepatic or segmental clamping (used for portal hypertension)

### Fluid Management

- **Pre-resection**: Limit IV fluids, maintain BP and urine output, target low CVP (< 5 mmHg)
- **SVV Monitoring**: SVV > 10% predicts low CVP, acceptable up to 20% during resection
- **Fluid Choice**: Acetate-buffered solutions preferred over lactate-buffered solutions
- **Drugs and Techniques**: NTG, diuretics, volatiles, reverse Trendelenburg, PEEP, normovolemic hemodilution
- **Vasopressors**: Maintain MAP within 20% of baseline
- **Complications**: Inadequate organ perfusion, VAE

## Postoperative Management

1. ICU admission
2. Monitor for postoperative fever
3. Monitor for bleeding and coagulopathy
4. Watch for PHLF (≥ day 5): Presents with hyperbilirubinemia and increased INR
5. Maintain euvolemia, glucose, electrolytes, and phosphate supplementation
6. Monitor for liver dysfunction and coagulopathy: Glucose infusion, correction of coagulation and electrolyte abnormalities
7. Common to develop significant ascites within 48 hours, monitor for hypovolemia
8. Avoid acetaminophen until liver function normalizes

## **Preoperative Recommendations**

1. **Preoperative counseling**  
   Patients should receive preoperative information and counseling on liver surgery. Brochures and multimedia may help improve verbal counseling.
2. **Prehabilitation**  
   Recommended for high-risk patients (e.g., elderly, malnourished, overweight, smokers, or those with psychological disorders). Prehabilitation should start 4–6 weeks before surgery, focusing on physical exercises and other interventions. Specific content is not standardized.
3. **Preoperative biliary drainage**  
   Recommended in cholestatic liver (>50 mmol/l), particularly for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, via percutaneous or endoscopic drainage. Surgery should wait until bilirubin drops below 50 mmol/l.
4. **Preoperative smoking and alcohol cessation**  
   Smoking cessation is advised 4 weeks preoperatively. Alcohol cessation is recommended for heavy drinkers (≥24 g/day for women and ≥36 g/day for men) at least 4–8 weeks before surgery.
5. **Preoperative nutrition**  
   Malnourished patients (e.g., weight loss >10% or >5% in 3 months, low BMI, or low fat-free mass) should receive enteral supplementation for at least 7–14 days preoperatively.
6. **Perioperative oral immunonutrition**  
   Immunonutrition is not recommended due to lack of evidence.
7. **Preoperative fasting and carbohydrate load**  
   Patients should fast 2 hours for liquids and 6 hours for solids before surgery. Carbohydrate loading is recommended 2–4 hours before anesthesia to improve insulin resistance, though the effect on length of stay is unclear.
8. **Pre-anesthetic medication**  
   Long-acting anxiolytics should be avoided, especially in elderly patients. Gabapentinoids and NSAIDs are not recommended. Preoperative acetaminophen should be dose-adjusted to the extent of resection. Anti-emetic patches may be used in patients at risk of postoperative nausea.
9. **Anti-thrombotic prophylaxis**  
   Low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin is recommended to reduce thromboembolic risk, starting postoperatively unless contraindicated. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices are also suggested.
10. **Prophylactic nasogastric intubation**  
	Routine prophylactic nasogastric intubation is not recommended as it does not improve outcomes and may increase hospital stay.
11. **Prophylactic abdominal drainage**  
	Routine abdominal drain placement is not recommended for hepatectomy without biliary reconstruction, though it may be considered for biliary reconstruction cases.
12. **Preoperative steroids**  
   Steroid administration (methylprednisolone 500 mg) is recommended. No specific recommendation for diabetic patients due to lack of data
13. **Antimicrobial prophylaxis and skin preparation**  
   Antibiotics (e.g., cefazolin) should be given 60 minutes before surgery. In complex surgeries, targeted regimens may be needed. Skin preparation with alcohol-based chlorhexidine is recommended.

## **Intraoperative Recommendations**

1. **Minimally invasive surgery**  
   Laparoscopic liver resection is recommended in trained teams, as it reduces length of stay and complication rates.
2. **Epidural, postoperative intravenous, and postoperative per oral analgesia**  
   For open liver surgery, thoracic epidural analgesia provides excellent pain relief but has disadvantages (e.g., hypotension, mobility issues). Multimodal analgesia is recommended to avoid these risks. No regional anesthesia is needed for laparoscopic surgery; multimodal analgesia with intravenous opioids is preferred.
3. **Wound catheter and transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block**  
   Continuous local anesthetic wound infiltration reduces complication rates and provides similar analgesia to thoracic epidural. Adding a TAP block improves pain control and reduces opioid use.
4. **Preventing intraoperative hypothermia**  
   Multimodal temperature management (e.g., warming garments or forced warm air) should be used during open and minimally invasive liver surgery to prevent hypothermia.
5. **Fluid management**  
   Low central venous pressure (<5 cm H₂O) with close monitoring is advised during hepatic transection. Balanced crystalloids are preferred over saline or colloids for maintenance fluid therapy. Goal-directed fluid therapy may improve outcomes in patients with low venous pressure states or reduced cardiac function.
## **Postoperative Recommendations**

1. **Postoperative artificial nutrition and early oral intake**  
   Early oral intake with a normal diet is recommended post-hepatectomy. Artificial nutrition may be required for malnourished patients or those with complications. Enteral over parenteral nutrition is preferred if necessary.
2. **Postoperative glycemic control**  
   Insulin therapy to maintain normoglycemia (<8.3 mmol/l) is recommended postoperatively.
3. **Early and scheduled mobilization**  
   Early mobilization (out of bed) after liver surgery should begin on the day of surgery and continue daily until discharge.
4. **Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis**  
   Multimodal PONV prophylaxis is recommended with at least two antiemetics, such as dexamethasone and ondansetron.
5. **Prevention of delayed gastric emptying (DGE)**  
   Use of an omental flap to cover the cut liver surface may reduce delayed gastric emptying risk after left-sided liver resection.
6. **Stimulation of bowel movement**  
   Postoperative laxatives, gum chewing, herbal medicine, or decoctions may reduce time to first flatus or stool, but current evidence is insufficient for routine recommendation.

## **Other Recommendations**
1. **Monitoring/Audit**  
   Auditing and feedback are associated with better outcomes in surgery. These should be implemented and performed to monitor and improve compliance with ERAS guidelines.
