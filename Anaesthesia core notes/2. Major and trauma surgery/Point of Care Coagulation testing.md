# Viscoelastic (TEG and ROTEM)

## General TEG
### How it Works
- 0.36mL of whole blood is placed into a heated cuvette (37°C) which rotates every 10 seconds at an angle of 4°45'.
- A pin connected to a torsion wire is suspended in the sample. Initially the pin does not move.
- Once clotting takes place, the pin moves as the sample is rotated → torsion in the wire → transmitted to a mechanico-electrical transducer →  generates the signal. As fibrinolysis ensues, the wire de-torts.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Fixed Ratio Massive Transfusion

#### Advantages

- **Rapidly available** (time-limited by the thawing of FFP only).
- **Available almost everywhere**.
- **Easily protocolised**, i.e., easy to order and does not divert focus from managing the trauma.
- **Cost of products** is the only expense; maintenance cost for the blood bank staff and equipment is not purely for support of MTPs.
- **Widespread familiarity** with the standard transfusion ratio.
- **Does not interfere with the use of TEG** (i.e., one may simply order the MTP pack while waiting for the TEG sample to cook).

#### Disadvantages

- **Exact ratio (e.g., 1:1:1)** is still a matter of debate.
- **Fixed ratio of products** does not account for the possibility of fibrinolysis.
- **Non-diagnostic**: unlike TEG, it is not an investigation of clotting function but a management protocol implemented before results are available.
#### TEG Guided Transfusions
### Advantages and Disadvantages of TEG (Thromboelastography) Guided Transfusions

#### Advantages

- **Rapid** (10-20 min).
- **Cheaper** than wasting blood products.
- **Conserves blood bank resources**.
- **Rapidly becoming more common**.
- **Tests fibrinolysis**, which otherwise is not conveniently done.
- **Individualised care**: compensates for intercase variability of clotting factor consumption.
- **Demonstrates that coagulopathy is fully corrected**, promoting surgical management.

#### Disadvantages

- **Not as rapid** as empirical transfusion (wastes valuable minutes).
- **More expensive** than coags if recalibration and maintenance costs are included.
- **Rare in smaller and regional centres**.
- **Assessment of fibrinolysis** is often omitted in place of routinely giving tranexamic acid.
- **Requires training to use and interpret**.
- **Poor precision**.
- **Does not account for hypothermia-induced coagulopathy**.
- **Does not identify warfarin or most NOACs**.
- **TEG-guided algorithms** do not have widespread familiarity and acceptance as valid.
### Limitations
- Must be processed within 3 minutes without activators for a true MA; heating will not truly reflect the haemostatics of a hypothermic patient; Even citrated samples have maximum stability between 30 and 240 min

## Rationale for Heparinase in TEG

Heparinase will shorten a prolonged R-time if it was due to the effect of heparin ⇒ protamine should be given

### Modifications and Interpretations

- **Tissue Factor**: Activator standardizing clotting process; enables rapid establishment of maximal amplitude (MA).
- **R Time and Heparinase**: R value sensitive to heparin and endogenous heparan sulfate; heparinase-treated samples assess heparin impact.
- **Tissue Factor/Kaolin Activated TEG and ACT**: Reflection of clot strength and function; strong correlation with platelet count and function.
- **Fibrinogen and Platelet Function**: Correlation with platelet count; aids in discriminating hypofibrinogenemia.
- **Fibrinolysis**: Detected by analyzing clot lysis on TEG; empirical or inappropriate anti-fibrinolytic therapy avoided.
- **Hypercoagulability**: Screen for hypercoagulable states; shorter R values and accelerated clot propagation noted in thromboembolic patients.
- **Platelet Mapping TEG**: Tests platelet function in clot formation with and without anti-platelet drugs.

## ROTEM Vs TEG

### ROTEM® Analysis

- **Technology Description**: 300 µl of whole blood with activators incubated in disposable cuvette at 37°C.
- **Process**: A pin rotates in the blood, encountering impedance as clot strength increases. Detected by an optical system and translated into characteristic tracing.

### Strengths and Limitations of TEG®/ROTEM®

#### Strengths

- **Rapid assessment** of coagulation status.
- **Analysis of all three phases of coagulation**: initiation, amplification, and propagation.
- **Reduces rates of transfusion and surgical re-exploration**.
- **Detects hypercoagulable states** in postoperative patients.
- **TEG® kaolin and ROTEM® INTEM** cartridges sensitive to residual heparin, aiding in detection of inadequate heparin reversal.

#### Limitations

- **Cannot reflect endothelium contribution** to coagulation.
- **Poor predictors** of postoperative bleeding from preoperative baseline.
- **Does not reflect hypothermia effects**.
- **Insensitive to aspirin and clopidogrel**.
- **Lack of standardization** in sample collection and processing.
- **Concerns about adequate maintenance and quality control** outside laboratory settings.
- **Moderate agreement** between TEG® and ROTEM® results, not interchangeable.
### Pathway Activation

- **INTEM**: Intrinsic Pathway activation (F II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, Heparin).
- **EXTEM**: Extrinsic Pathway activation (F II, V, VII, X).
- **FIBTEM**: Fibrin activity/contribution to clot firmness (extrinsic activation, platelet neutralization).
- **HEPTEM**: Confirms heparin effect (intrinsic activation, heparin neutralization).
- **APTEM**: Confirmation of hyperfibrinolysis (extrinsic activation with antifibrinolytic agent).
### Possible Combinations of Abnormal TEMograms

![](Pasted%20image%2020240221155727.png)

**Fibtem neutralizes platelets**. The others neutralize heparin and fibrinolysis respectively

All improve on the preceding test except fibtem on extem if fibrinogen is low (knock out the platelets and clotting is bad => platelets are holding the fort => fibrinogen is low)

### Notes
- **First 2 lines are most important** - the rest are just TEG interpretation.
- The **G-value** is a log-derivation of the MA and represents the clot strength using dynes/sec. G increases exponentially in proportion to the amplitude of the tracing.
- **Estimated percent lysis (EPL)** is used to evaluate clot lysis, giving an idea about the percent lysis at 30 min after MA. The normal value of EPL is 0%-15%.
- **Delta** (Δ) is the time to the max speed of clot formation and represents thrombin burst.

- The G-value is a log-derivation of the MA and is meant to also represent the clot strength using dynes/sec. _G_ increases exponentially in proportion to the amplitude of the tracing. 
- Estimated percent lysis (EPL) is also used besides LY30 to evaluate clot lysis which gives an idea about the percent lysis at 30 min after MA. The normal value of EPL is 0%-15%.

## Platelet Function Testing

### Gold Standard: Light Transmission Aggregometry

- **Aspirin**:
	
	- Mechanism: Suppresses platelet function due to inhibition of COX, leading to decreased thromboxane A₂ (TXA₂) and reduced platelet aggregation.
	- Duration: Effects last up to 72-96 hours after stopping due to irreversible inhibition of COX on mature platelets.
- **Clopidogrel**:
	
	- Mechanism: Binds irreversibly to P2Y₁₂ ADP-receptor, resulting in decreased ADP-induced aggregation.
	- Duration: Effects last up to 7 days.
	- Monitoring: Monitored with P2Y₁₂ assay.

## Platelet Mapping

- **Purpose**: Provides the degree of inhibition of platelets via the ADP (Plavix) and AA (Aspirin) pathways, thereby assessing the effectiveness of antiplatelet drugs, which cannot be done with routine coagulation tests.
- **Procedure**: Involves four separate (channels) analyses:
	- **Baseline**: Kaolin activates platelets maximally as in regular TEG.
	- **Activator**: Heparin (via heparinized tube) inhibits thrombin, and activator (reptilase and Factor XIIIa) converts fibrinogen to fibrin.
	- **ADP**: Includes the fibrin clot activator and ADP, which activates platelets via the GP IIb/IIIa receptor.
	- **AA**: Includes the fibrin clot activator and arachidonic acid, which activates the thromboxane A₂ pathway, producing platelet aggregation.
- **Determination**: By comparing the relative strengths of the clots in the activator, ADP, or AA cups with the baseline, the percent platelet inhibition can be determined.
	- **Residual Function**: The residual function (percent aggregation) is multiplied by the baseline G to get the net G or net clot strength.
	- **Goal**: To maintain net clot strength between 5 and 9 to prevent bleeding or thrombosis.
