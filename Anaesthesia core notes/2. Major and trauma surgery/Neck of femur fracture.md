# Neck of Femur Fracture (NOF)

## Epidemiology

- **Prevalence:** 75% in women
- **Average Age:** 80 years
- **Common Mechanism of Injury (MOI):** Simple mechanical falls from standing position
- **Post-Operative Mortality:**
  - 30-day: 5-10%
  - 1-year: ~30%
- **Complications:**
  - 30% of elderly patients experience at least one post-operative complication
  - Only 30% return to pre-fracture function level
- **Cognitive Deficit:** 5%
- **Hospital Stay:** Mean length ~20 days
- **Guidelines to Address Morbidity and Mortality:**
  - Early pre-op assessment and optimization
  - Minimizing system delays
  - Early surgery
  - Multimodal analgesia starting pre-operatively
  - Multidisciplinary team involvement (orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetists, geriatricians, physiotherapists, dietitians)
- **Commonest Reason for Emergency Surgery in the Elderly:**
  - Hip fractures in patients >65 years have high mortality (14-35% in the first year)
  - Increased mortality risk factors
	  - Delayed surgery >96 hours, dementia, heart failure, metastatic malignancy, renal disease, high ASA, low albumin, elevated lactate, prolonged surgery, age >80 years
  - **Recommendations:**
  - Expedite transfer and surgery
  - Conduct thorough pre-op assessments
  - Utilize appropriate anaesthetic techniques tailored to patient needs
  - Implement multimodal analgesia and early mobilization strategies
  - Regularly assess and manage risks to improve patient outcomes

## Surgical Management

- **Fracture Fixation:**
  - Cannulated Hip Screw
  - Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS)
  - Richards Screw
- **Hemiarthroplasty:** Cemented or uncemented

## Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS)

The NHFS predicts 30-day mortality in patients with hip fractures based on several variables.

### Variables and Scores

| Variable | Value | Score |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Age** | 66–85 years | 3 |
|         | ≥86 years   | 4 |
| **Sex** | Male        | 1 |
| **Admission Hb** | ≤10 g/dL | 1 |
| **MMTS** | ≤6 out of 10 | 1 |
| **Living in an institution** | Yes | 1 |
| **Number of co-morbidities** | ≥2 | 1 |
| **Malignancy** | Yes | 1 |

### Total NHFS and Predicted 30-Day Mortality

| Total NHFS | Predicted 30-Day Mortality (%) |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| 0          | 0.9                           |
| 1          | 1.5                           |
| 2          | 2.4                           |
| 3          | 3.8                           |
| 4          | 6.2                           |
| 5          | 9.8                           |
| 6          | 15                            |
| 7          | 23                            |
| 8          | 33                            |
| 9          | 47                            |
| 10         | 57                            |
