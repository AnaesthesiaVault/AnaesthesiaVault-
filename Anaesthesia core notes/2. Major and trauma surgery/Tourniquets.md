# Tourniquets

## Effects

### Local
- **Muscle:**
  - Increased PCO₂, decreased PO₂, increased lactate, metabolic acidosis.
  - Microvascular injury if applied for more than 2 hours.
- **Nerve:**
  - Physiological conduction block due to ischemia.
  - Longer-lasting conduction block due to mechanical compression (tourniquet paralysis).

### Systemic
- **Cardiovascular System (CVS):**
  - Increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR).
  - Increased circulating volume leading to increased central venous pressure (CVP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (transient on inflation).
  - Tourniquet pain (T Pain) can lead to a gradual increase in blood pressure; use Ketamine 0.25 mg/kg for management.
  - On deflation: decreased CVP, decreased SBP, post-ischemic reactive hyperemia.
- **Respiratory:**
  - Increased end-tidal CO₂ (EtCO₂) on deflation due to increased cardiac output (CO) and release of hypercapnic blood.
- **Central Nervous System (CNS):**
  - Deflation leads to increased PCO₂, which in turn increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP).
- **Hematological:**
  - Pain leads to catecholamine release, increasing platelet aggregation and creating a hypercoagulable state.
- **Temperature (T°):**
  - Gradual increase after inflation, and the opposite effect on deflation.
- **Metabolic:**
  - Deflation results in increased potassium (K⁺), lactate, CO₂, and decreased pH.

## Indications and Contraindications

### Indications
- Surgical procedures on extremities, such as repair of tendons, nerves, and blood vessels.

### Contraindications (Relative)
- Patient refusal.
- Severe peripheral vascular disease.
- Sickle cell disease.
- Severe crush injury.
- Diabetic neuropathy.
- History of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

## Safe Times and Pressures

### In Reality
- **How orthopedists inflate:**
  - To fixed pressures (typically 250 mm Hg for the upper arm and 300 mm Hg for the thigh).
  - To pressures that are a fixed amount above systolic arterial pressure (typically +100 mm Hg for the upper arm and +100-150 mm Hg for the thigh).
- **Criticism:**
  - Fixed pressures do not account for the patient's usual arterial pressure.
  - Younger age is an independent predictor of neurological injury after prolonged tourniquet times due to lower systolic pressures and larger differences between tourniquet inflation pressure and arterial pressure.

### How It Should Be Done
- **Association of peri-operative Registered Nurses (AORN) Recommendations:**
  - Inflate tourniquets to pressures based on limb occlusion pressure (LOP).
  - LOP is determined by gradually increasing the pressure while assessing distal blood flow with a Doppler probe over a distal artery.
  - The LOP is the pressure at which the arterial pulse disappears.
  - The percentage of transmitted tourniquet pressure varies inversely with limb circumference.
- **Cuff inflation pressure should be adjusted by adding a safety margin to the LOP as follows:**
  - Add 40 mmHg for LOP <130 mmHg.
  - Add 60 mmHg for LOP between 131 and 190 mmHg.
  - Add 80 mmHg for LOP >190 mmHg.
  - For pediatric patients, adding 50 mmHg is recommended.
- **Time:**
  - No strict guidelines, generally 1.5-2 hours.
  - Three-fold increase in the risk of neurological complications for every 30 minutes more.
  - Deflate for 10-15 minutes if continuing.

## Complications
- **Ischemia and Compression:**
  - Can damage any tissues in the limb (low incidence: 0.04%).
- **Nerve Injury:**
  - Most common; lower limb > upper limb.
  - Sciatic nerve followed by radial nerve.
  - Longer tourniquet times increase the risk of neurological injury, with mechanical pressure playing a more significant role than ischemia.
  - Large diameter nerve fibers are more susceptible to pressure, relatively sparing sensation compared to motor function.
  - Compression at the site may exacerbate injury at a distal site (double crush phenomenon).
- **Muscle Injury:**
  - Rhabdomyolysis is extremely rare.
- **Skin Injury:**
  - Chemical and friction burns.
- **Vascular Injury:**
  - Rare; acute vascular insufficiency can occur from mechanical pressure causing plaque rupture in atheromatous vessels.
  - Avoid arterial tourniquets in patients with peripheral vascular disease.
- **Intra-operative Bleeding:**
  - Common causes include incomplete exsanguination, poorly fitting or underpressurized cuffs, and blood entering through intramedullary vessels of long bones.

## Tourniquet Pain
- **Description:**
  - Dull, aching pain following tourniquet inflation.
  - Can necessitate conversion to general anesthesia despite adequate regional anesthesia.
- **Mechanism:**
  - Predominantly mediated by unmyelinated, slowly conducting C-fibers less affected by compressive effects than larger fibers.
  - Tourniquet pain arises from selective transmission by cutaneous C-fibers continuously stimulated by skin compression, with reduced inhibition from blocked larger nerve fibers.
  - In spinal or epidural anesthesia, C-fibers are more resistant to local anesthetic-induced conduction block, causing dull pain as the local anesthetic concentration decreases.
- **Management:**
  - Increase the density of central neuraxial block using adjuncts like epinephrine, morphine, and clonidine.
  - Preoperative gabapentin and low-dose (0.1 mg/kg) IV ketamine have been successful.
  - Clonidine preoperatively can also be effective.

## Tourniquet-Induced Hypertension
- **Description:**
  - Gradual increase in arterial pressure after tourniquet inflation.
  - Mechanism likely involves sympathetic nervous system activation due to tourniquet pain.
  - Plasma norepinephrine concentrations increase parallel to arterial pressure during inflation.
- **Management:**
  - Clonidine can blunt this response.
