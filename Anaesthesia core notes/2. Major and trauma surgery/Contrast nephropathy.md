# Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN)

## Presentation
- **Radiocontrast Induced Renal Failure:**
  - Usually mild, transient, and nonoliguric.
  - Begins within 12-24 hours of contrast administration.
  - Recovery typically within 3-5 days.
- **Severe Cases:**
  - Creatinine peaks > 5 mg/dL (440 μmol/L), particularly if baseline plasma creatinine > 4 mg/dL (352 μmol/L).
  - May require dialysis.
  - Persistent renal failure occurs in patients with advanced underlying disease, especially diabetics.

## Diagnosis
- **Characteristic Rise in Plasma Creatinine:**
  - Begins within the first 12-24 hours post-contrast administration.
- **Differential Diagnosis:**
  - Consider ischemic acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, and renal atheroemboli.
  - **Renal Atheroemboli Indicators:**
	- Presence of embolic lesions or livedo reticularis.
	- Transient eosinophilia and hypocomplementaemia.
	- Delayed onset renal failure (days to weeks post-procedure).
	- Protracted course with minimal or no recovery of renal function.

## Management of Contrast-Induced Acute Renal Failure
- **General Management:**
  - No specific treatment for contrast-induced acute renal failure.
  - Manage as acute tubular necrosis, focusing on fluid maintenance and electrolyte balance.

### Summary of Strategies
- **Optimal Prophylaxis:**
  - Uncertain but includes avoidance of volume depletion and NSAIDs.
- **At-Risk Patients (Defined by Rudnick et al):**
  - Plasma creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL (132 mmol/L) or eGFR < 60 mL/1.73 m², especially in diabetics.
  - Recommendations:
	- Use non-contrast diagnostic modalities where possible.
	- Avoid high osmolal agents (Grade 1A).
	- Prefer iso-osmolal agents to low osmolal agents (Grade 2B).
	- Use lower doses of contrast and avoid repetitive studies < 48 hours apart.
	- Administer isotonic IV fluids before and after contrast administration (Grade 1B).

#### Fluid Regimen for Prophylaxis
- **Isotonic Saline:**
  - 1 mL/kg/hr, started at least 2 and preferably 6-12 hours prior to the procedure, and continued for 6-12 hours after contrast administration.
- **Isotonic Bicarbonate:**
  - Bolus of 3 mL/kg over 1 hour pre-procedure, continued at 1 mL/kg/hr for 6 hours post-procedure.
  - Preparation: Add 150 meq sodium bicarbonate to 850 mL of 5% dextrose in water.

## Reduction of Incidence After a Previous Reaction
1. **Stop β-Blockers.**
2. **Premedicate with Corticosteroids ± Antihistamines.**
3. **Consider Alternative Contrast Mediums:**
   - CO₂ or CO₂ DSA.
