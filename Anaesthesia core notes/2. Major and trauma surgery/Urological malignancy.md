# TURBT

## Procedure
- **Procedure**: Cystoscopic diathermy resection of bladder tumour
- **Duration**: 10–40 minutes
- **Pain**: +/++ and bladder spasm
- **Position**: Lithotomy
- **Blood Loss**: 0 to >500 mL
- **Practical Techniques**: General anaesthesia (GA) with laryngeal mask airway (LMA); spinal ± sedation

## Preoperative
- Most common in smokers—check for coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- Check haemoglobin (Hb)—chronic blood loss is common.
- Check renal function.
- Refer to previous anaesthetic charts—many patients have had repeated surgeries.

## Perioperative
- **Obturator Spasm**: Occurs when the obturator nerve, which runs adjacent to the lateral walls of the bladder, is directly stimulated by the diathermy current. It causes adduction of the leg and can seriously impair surgical access and increase the risk of bladder perforation. It can usually be controlled by reducing the diathermy current.
- Administer antibiotic prophylaxis.

## Post-operative
- **Pain Management**: Pain can be significant with extensive resections. NSAIDs are useful (check renal function), and oral opioids may be needed.
- **Bladder Spasm**: Common postoperative issue (refer to E p. 587).
- **Special Considerations**: If using spinal anaesthesia, ensure the block is above T10.
# Open Simple Prostatectomy and Radical Prostatectomy

## Procedure

### Simple Retropubic (Millen Procedure)
- **Procedure**: Open excision of grossly hypertrophied benign prostate shelled out of capsule
- **Duration**: 60–120 minutes
- **Pain**: +++/++++
- **Position**: Supine
- **Blood Loss**: 300–1000 mL
- **Cross-match**: 2 units, and use cell salvage if available

### Radical Retropubic
- **Procedure**: Open complete excision of malignant prostate and pelvic lymph nodes with anastomosis
- **Duration**: 120–180 minutes
- **Pain**: +++/++++
- **Position**: Supine
- **Blood Loss**: 500–2000 mL
- **Cross-match**: 2 units, and use cell salvage if available

### Practical Techniques
- Endotracheal tube (ETT), intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), remifentanil ± rectus sheath catheters ±

## Preoperative
- **Simple**: Common in elderly men, similar to TURP preparation.
- **Radical**: Patients are selected if relatively young and medically fit.
- Check renal function.
- Consider high dependency unit (HDU) bed for radical prostatectomy, depending on local practice and medical factors.

## Perioperative
- Prepare for major blood loss with a large IV cannula, blood warmer, heated blankets, etc.
- A Pfannenstiel-type incision is used for simple, and lower midline for radical prostatectomy.
- Consider using an arterial line and central venous pressure (CVP) line or cardiac output monitoring, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease.
- Ensure blood is available, and reorder intraoperatively as necessary.
- Cell salvage techniques can be useful where blood loss is expected to be substantial (radical prostatectomy).
- Air embolism is a possible complication.
- Use epidural cautiously intraoperatively to avoid exacerbating hypotension due to blood loss.
- Consider using remifentanil infusion intraoperatively.

## Post-operative
- Epidural or rectus sheath catheters, and possibly patient-controlled analgesia (PCA).
# Nephrectomy and Partial Nephrectomy

## Introduction
### Indications
- The vast majority (~90%) of solid renal masses are renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with the remainder comprising mainly transitional cell carcinoma or Wilm’s tumour (in children). RCC accounts for 1–3% of all visceral malignancies.

### Incidence
- Twice as common in men compared to women, most commonly presenting in the seventh decade of life.

### Risk Factors
- Main environmental risk factor: cigarette smoking (contributes to one-third of all cases).
- Other important risk factors: obesity, hypertension, asbestos exposure, acquired polycystic kidney disease.

### Diagnosis
- Approximately 40% of RCCs are detected incidentally on abdominal imaging.
- Tumour size is frequently small and confined to the kidney; however, ~25% of cases present with distant metastases (commonly in the lung, bone, liver, and brain). Metastases do not preclude surgery, as nephrectomy can still improve symptoms, quality of life, and prognosis.
- Tumour extension into the renal vein and/or inferior vena cava (IVC) is seen in up to 25% of cases and can present with severe pulmonary congestion and pulmonary embolism. Less than 10% will present with thrombus inside the IVC, with fewer than 2% having thrombus and tumour at the border of the right atrium. This group benefits from surgery despite extensive IVC involvement.

### Surgery
- After radical nephrectomy, one-third of patients will have significantly reduced renal reserve (GFR <45 mL/min, ~CKD Stage 3B).

## Procedure

- **Procedure**: Excision of kidney for tumour, other pathologies, or live donor.
- **Duration**: 1–2.5 hours.
- **Pain**: +++/++++.
- **Position**: Supine or lateral (kidney position).
- **Blood Loss**: Depends on pathology, 300 to >3000 mL. Group and save/cross-match as required.
- **Practical Techniques**: Endotracheal tube (ETT) + intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) ± thoracic epidural or wound infiltration catheter.

## Considerations

### 1. Surgical Technique
- Incision type/extent/positioning (laparoscopic/Trendelenburg).
- Preoperative assessment of cardio-respiratory tolerance.

### 2. Blood Loss
- Large bore IV lines ± invasive blood pressure (IBP) monitoring.
- Cell saver can be considered (even though malignancy!).

### 3. Cavo-Atrial Disease (CVAD)
- Preoperative imaging.
- Anticoagulation.
- Intraoperative monitoring with transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE).
- May need cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) ± deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA).

### 4. Analgesia
- Epidural/PCA/wound infiltration.
- Avoid regional in CVAD due to anticoagulation.

### 5. Other Intraoperative Considerations
- Warming.
- Rigorous venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis (stockings, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), calf compressors).
- Bladder catheterization.
- No antibiotics unless specifically indicated.

### 6. Postoperative
- High care if CPB/CVAD/epidural.
## Nephrectomy Cocktail
- Administration: Mannitol 12.5 g, furosemide 10 mg, and/or heparin 3000 IU before clamping the renal artery to maintain renal perfusion and minimize ischemia. Cooling with ice can also be used.

## Renal Transplant Cocktail
- Post-Perfusion: Hydrocortisone 100 mg, mannitol 20% 60 mL, furosemide 80 mg or more. Alternatively, dopamine (3 µg/kg/min), mannitol 0.5 g/kg, and furosemide 250 mg (rate of 4 mg/min). Evidence for this regimen is sparse.

## Cavo-Atrial Disease

### Novick Classification of Cavo-Atrial Tumour Extension in Patients with RCC

#### Level 1
- Thrombus into IVC but <2 cm above the renal vein.

#### Level 2
- Thrombus below the intrahepatic vena cava.

#### Level 3
- Thrombus involves the intrahepatic vena cava but below the diaphragm.

#### Level 4
- Thrombus involves the right atrium.
- **TOE**: Extremely valuable, provides more detailed information than CT/MRI for retrohepatic tumour thrombus imaging.
- **Angio-embolization**: Performed preoperatively to reduce excessive blood loss.
- **Multispecialty Approach**: Involves radiology, anaesthesia, urology, vascular, hepatobiliary specialists, and possibly cardiothoracic input.
- **CPB**: Used for level 4 and occasionally level 3 tumour extent.
- **DHCA**: Occasionally used in level 4 disease.

## Preoperative

- Ascertain pathology and planned surgical incision before deciding on the technique and monitoring.
- Check haemoglobin (Hb)—renal tumours can cause anaemia without blood loss.
- Check blood pressure (BP) and renal function—non-functioning kidney or renovascular disease is associated with renal impairment and hypertension.
- Consider cell salvage intraoperatively.
- Check serum electrolytes—renal tumour can cause inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion.
- Check chest radiograph if there is a tumour—there may be metastases, pleural effusions, etc.
- **Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)**: Developed for some tumours, avoids the need for open surgery.
- **Laparoscopic Nephrectomy**: Becoming more common.
- **Arterial Line**: Necessary for some patients.
- **TOE**: Required for stage 3/4 extension.
- **Positioning**: Considerations for both open and laparoscopic nephrectomy to avoid pressure sores, nerve damage, venous pooling, corneal abrasion, and venous congestion.

## Perioperative

- **Hypothermia Prevention**: Active warming with a forced-air warmer, heated mattress, and warmed IV fluids.
- **VTE Prophylaxis**: Graduated stockings, LMWH, pneumatic calf compression devices.
- **Open Laparotomy**: For large tumours and polycystic kidneys, via paramedian or transverse incision.
- **Loin Incision**: Kidney position; lateral with patient extended over a break in the table—marked fall in BP is common.
- **Surgeon Consultation**: About predicted extent of surgery.
- **IV Cannulae**: Use large ones, blood warmer, central venous pressure (CVP), and arterial line if needed.
- **Epidural Use**: Cautious intraoperatively until bleeding is under control.
- **General and Loco-Regional Technique**: Usually combined well.
- **Pain Management**: Low thoracic epidural analgesia, paravertebral block, wound catheters, and local infiltration.
- **Avoid Regional Anaesthesia**: In cavo-atrial involvement due to anticoagulation and extensive blood loss.

## Postoperative

- **Pain Management**: Epidurals useful, need to cover up to T7/8 for a loin incision. Rectus sheath catheters may be useful for the anterior approach. PCA or opioid infusion as an alternative.
- **Intercostal Blocks**: Provide analgesia for several hours after a loin incision.
- **Wound Infiltration Catheters**: Proved effective.
- **NSAIDs**: Useful if renal function is good postoperatively and the patient is not hypovolaemic. Use cautiously.
- **Monitor Urine Output**: Hourly.

### Partial Nephrectomy

- Increasingly performed for well-localized tumour or in a patient with only one kidney.
- Blood loss can be large.
- Some surgeons suggest administration of mannitol, furosemide, and/or heparin before clamping of the renal artery.
- Cooling with ice may also be used.
- Optimization of fluid balance throughout the perioperative period is extremely important.
- Consider admission to HDU postoperatively.

### Dermatomes Requiring Regional Anaesthesia Blockade After Nephrectomy According to Incision Used

#### Incision and Corresponding Dermatomes
- **Flank**: T9–T11
- **Thoraco-abdominal**: T7–T12
- **Trans-abdominal**: T6–T10

### Complications After Nephrectomy

#### Immediate
- Vascular injury
- Splenic injury
- Bowel injury
- Pneumothorax

#### Early
- Acute renal failure
- Bowel obstruction
- Peritonitis
- DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) and pulmonary embolus

#### Late
- Chronic renal failure
- Incisional hernias
- Wound infection
# Radical Cystectomy

## Procedure

- **Procedure**: Excision of bladder plus urinary diversion procedure (e.g., ileal conduit) or neo-bladder reconstruction (orthotopic bladder formation)
- **Duration**: 3–5 hours (longer with bladder reconstruction)
- **Pain**: ++++
- **Position**: Lithotomy plus head-down
- **Blood Loss**: 700 to >3000 mL, cross-match 4 units, use cell salvage
- **Practical Techniques**: Endotracheal tube (ETT), intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), arterial line ± oesophageal Doppler/central venous pressure (CVP) ± rectus sheath catheters/patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)/epidural

## Preoperative

- Consider the use of an ‘enhanced recovery pathway’.
- Check for ischaemic heart disease (IHD)/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal function, and full blood count (FBC).
- Book a high dependency unit (HDU) bed, depending on local practice/coexisting problems.
- Ensure thromboprophylaxis is prescribed.

## Perioperative

- **Prolonged Ileus**: Common postoperative problem contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality. Several measures are thought to reduce its incidence.
- **Blood Loss Preparation**: Large IV cannulae, blood warmer, CVP or oesophageal Doppler cardiac output, and direct arterial monitoring are routine. Ensure blood is available, and reorder intraoperatively as necessary. Consider auto-transfusion intraoperatively. Discontinue blood salvage when the bowel is opened.
- **Rectus Sheath Catheters**: Insert after induction as the subumbilical midline surgical incision does not permit easy placement during surgery.
- **Anaesthesia**: Remifentanil infusion provides stable anaesthesia and controllable blood pressure (BP); mild hypotension can aid surgery by reducing blood loss.
- **Epidurals**: Used infrequently but, if placed, use cautiously intraoperatively. There will be plenty of time after the main blood-losing episode to establish an adequate block.
- **Heat Loss Prevention**: Use warm-air blankets.
- **Antibiotic Prophylaxis**: As for bowel resection.
- **Nasogastric Tubes (NGTs)**: Rarely used; ask the surgeon if specifically required.
- **Blood Loss**: Can be insidious from pelvic venous plexuses; consider weighing swabs.
- **Air Embolism**: A possible complication, as in any major pelvic surgery.

## Postoperative

- **Rectus Sheath Catheters**: For up to 5 days, with or without PCA, have proven very effective. Visceral pain tends to last for 24–36 hours postoperatively, requiring parenteral opioids. This technique enables early mobilization, return of bowel function, and decreased postoperative ileus/length of hospital stay.
- **NSAIDs**: Use cautiously after checking renal function, as there is some evidence that anastomotic leak is increased with their use.
- **Fluid Replacement**: Use CVP/urine output to guide fluid replacement—requirements are usually large due to intraperitoneal loss and ileus.
- **Urine Output Monitoring**: Difficult via a new ileal conduit, as drainage tends to be positional. Following orthotopic reconstruction, urine drains from multiple catheters and needs to be calculated each hour to monitor output.
- **Early Feeding**: As part of enhanced recovery, may reduce incidence of certain postoperative complications.
- **Ureteric Anastomosis Leak**: May present as urine in the abdominal drain—confirm by comparing biochemistry of the drainage fluid and urine from the conduit.

### Complications

- **Hyperchloraemic Metabolic Acidosis and Hypokalaemia**: Secondary to urinary absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT).
- **Ileus**: Very common; nasogastric drainage may be helpful.
