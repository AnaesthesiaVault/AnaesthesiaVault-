# Summary of Issues

![](Pasted%20image%2020240508191628.png)

The patient should be requested to sign a release form, absolving the medical practitioner from all liability flowing from a failure to administer blood products.  

Regarding childrenit is uncertain whether blood transfusions are surgical or medical processes.

Unlike adults the refusal of a minor (an individual who has not yet turned 18) is not absolute and may be overruled either by ministerial consent or an order by the High Court.

## Association of Anaesthetists: Anaesthesia and Peri-operative Care for Jehovah's Witnesses and Patients Who Refuse Blood

### Key Recommendations

1. **Patient Education and Consent**:
	
	- Provide clear explanations of potential blood products required during or after surgery.
	- Discuss alternative treatments if available.
	- Ensure patient understands risks involved in refusing blood.
2. **Documentation**:
	
	- Record in the medical notes which treatments/procedures the patient consents to and which they do not.
3. **Pre-operative Optimization**:
	
	- Check hemoglobin (Hb) at least 6 weeks before elective surgery expected to have significant blood loss.
	- Consider treatment with iron and/or erythropoietin if Hb is < 130 g.L-1.
4. **Team Briefing and Checklist**:
	
	- Highlight all relevant issues during team briefings and surgical safety checklists before anesthesia induction.
	- Maintain a checklist of acceptable and non-acceptable components/products/procedures.
5. **Intra-operative Cell Salvage**:
	
	- Discuss intra-operative cell salvage prior to surgery with Jehovah’s Witnesses, and obtain consent if agreed.
6. **Patient Blood Management**:
	
	- Apply interventions rigorously, including tranexamic acid administration for major surgery.
7. **Post-operative Handover**:
	
	- Ensure comprehensive verbal and written handover to staff.
	- Inform staff of any adverse intra-operative events and the patient's wishes discussed pre-procedure.
## Variable Acceptability of Different Blood Products Among Jehovah’s Witnesses

- **Generally Not Acceptable**:
	
	- Red cells, white cells, plasma, platelets.
- **May be Acceptable**:
	
	- Red cell fractions (e.g., Haemoglobin), white cell fractions (e.g., Interferons, interleukins), plasma fractions (e.g., Albumin, Immunoglobulins, Cryoprecipitate, Clotting factors), platelet fractions (e.g., Platelet factor 4).
	- Acute hypervolaemic haemodilution, intra-operative cell salvage, cardiopulmonary bypass/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal dialysis, plasmapheresis, epidural blood patch, transplants.
- **Generally Acceptable**:
	
	- Crystalloids and colloids, recombinant erythropoietin, recombinant factor VIIa, artificial blood substitutes.
## Emergency and Elective Framework

- **Elective Framework**:
	
	- Organize a confidential meeting to explain opinions based on best evidence.
	- Discuss the need to optimize haemoglobin before surgery.
	- Establish Jehovah’s Witness status, beliefs, and advance directive.
	- Establish opinion on blood products and determine acceptable/unacceptable products or procedures.
	- Explain proposed medical interventions and their risks and alternatives.
	- Fully document discussions and acceptable options.
- **Emergency Framework**:
	
	- Depends on presence of capacity, patient age, and advance directives.
	- Aim for a private discussion free from coercion.
	- Establish urgency, Jehovah’s Witness status, and position on blood/products.
	- Use collateral sources if necessary.
	- Clearly explain the patient’s condition and treatment options.
	- Aim for consensus and compromise.
	- Fully document discussion, actions, etc.
# Perioperative Blood Management

## There Are Four Specific Aims

(i) to minimize blood loss; 

(ii)to optimize oxygen delivery and consumption; 

(iii) to enhance (Hb) synthesis and erythropoiesis; 

(iv) to correct coagulation defects and promote haemostasis.

## General Principles

- Act promptly to minimize blood loss.
- Establish Jehovah’s Witness status, legal issues, and advance directive.
- Determine acceptable therapies.
- Plan for worst-case scenarios.
- Provide thorough documentation.
- Ensure early consultant involvement and referral.
- Monitor closely with limited phlebotomy.
- Maintain a low threshold for intensive care unit involvement.

## Targeted Therapies

1. **Stop/Minimize Blood Loss**:
	
	- Prompt surgical intervention, replace intravascular volume.
	- Consider cell salvage, washing and reinfusion of drain fluid, arterial tourniquets, interventional radiology, acute hypervolaemic haemodilution, permissive hypotension, uterotonics for uterine bleeding.
2. **Optimize Anaemia Tolerance**:
	
	- Maximize oxygen delivery, supplemental O₂, treat underlying lung pathology.
	- Consider intubation/ventilation, cardiopulmonary bypass/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, red cell substitutes.
	- Minimize O₂ uptake and metabolic demand, treat shock and maintain cardiac output, sedation, paralysis, cooling.
3. **Enhance Haemoglobin and Red Blood Cell Production**:
	
	- Iron sucrose 200 mg i.v. three times per week.
	- Vitamin B12 1 mg i.v. once daily.
	- Folate 20 mg i.v. on alternate days.
	- Recombinant erythropoietin 600 μg kg^-1 (up to daily).
4. **Correct Coagulation Defects and Promote Haemostasis**:
	
	- Maintain normothermia, stop drugs impairing clotting.
	- Discuss with haematologist.
	- Cryoprecipitate (if acceptable), prothrombin complex concentrate 20–50 μg kg^-1, Vitamin K 10 mg i.v., tranexamic acid 1 g i.v. every 6 h, desmopressin 0.3 μg kg^-1 in 50 ml saline over 30 min.
	- Consider fibrinogen concentrate (if acceptable) 2 g i.v., Factor VIII and IX replacement, recombinant factor VIIa, aprotinin.
## General Interventions

### Positioning
- Potential cardiovascular effects that may increase bleeding risk by altering preload, cardiac output, and peripheral vascular resistance.

### Mode of Ventilation
- **Spontaneous Positive Ventilation (SPV)** vs. **Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV)** and their impact on intrathoracic pressure.

### Hypothermia Prevention
- Avoid hypothermia to prevent coagulopathy and minimize blood loss.

## Specific Interventions

### Acute Normovolaemic Haemodilution
- Involves the removal of blood followed by rapid infusion of colloid or crystalloid to restore plasma volume.
- Results in lower haematocrit surgical blood loss, with previously stored blood reinfused.
- May not be acceptable to Jehovah's Witnesses unless a closed circuit is used, despite evidence suggesting a reduced risk of allogeneic transfusion.

### Acute Hypervolaemic Haemodilution
- A simpler, acceptable alternative not involving the removal of the patient's blood.

### Hypotensive Anaesthesia
- Defined as a systolic blood pressure of 80-90 mm Hg, a mean arterial pressure of 50-65 mm Hg, or a 30% reduction of baseline mean arterial pressure.
- Reduces perioperative blood loss and improves surgical field visibility.

### Regional and Central Neuraxial Anaesthesia
- Compared to general anaesthesia, these are associated with reduced estimated blood loss and postoperative transfusion requirements.

## Surgical Care

### Key Principles
- Meticulous haemostasis.

### Other Considerations
- **Surgical Techniques**: Use of endoscopic or laparoscopic methods.
- **Diathermy**: Utilization of electric current to cut tissue and cauterize bleeding vessels.
- **Ultrasonic Scalpels**: Instruments using ultrasonic vibrations for precise cutting and coagulation.
- **Collagen or Cellulose Pads**: Examples include Kaltostat.
- **Fibrin Glues and Sealants**: Examples include Tisseal.

### Complex and Lengthy Surgery
- Consideration of staged procedures for surgeries expected to be complex and lengthy.
