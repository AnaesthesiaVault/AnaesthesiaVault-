# SPIKES Model

## 1. Set up the Interview

- Rehearse mentally; review the plan for telling the patient and how to respond to his/her emotional reactions or difficult questions.
- Arrange for some privacy.
- Involve significant others if that is the patient’s choice.
- Sit down with the patient.
- Make a connection with the patient: maintain eye contact and/or touch the patient on the arm or hold a hand if he/she is comfortable with you doing so.
- Manage time constraints and interruptions; set your pager on silent or ask a colleague to respond to your pages.

## 2. Assess the patient’s Perception

- Determine what the patient knows about the medical condition or what he/she suspects.
- Listen to the patient’s level of comprehension.
- Determine if the patient is engaging in illness denial.

## 3. Obtain the patient’s Invitation

- Ask the patient if he/she wishes to know the details of the medical condition and/or treatment.
- Accept the patient’s right not to know.
- Offer to answer questions later if he/she wishes.

## 4. Give Knowledge and Information

- Warn the patient that bad news is coming; this may lessen the shock that can follow the disclosure of bad news.
- Start at the patient’s level of comprehension and vocabulary.
- Use non-technical words.
- Avoid excessive bluntness.
- Give information in small chunks, and periodically check the patient’s understanding.
- Avoid using phrases such as “There is nothing more we can do for you”; this attitude is inconsistent with the fact that patients often have other important therapeutic goals.

## 5. Address the patient’s Emotions with Empathic Responses

- Observe for any emotion on the part of the patient.
- Identify the emotion experienced by the patient by naming it to oneself.
- Identify the reason for the emotion.
- Let the patient know you have connected the emotion with the reason for the emotion by making a connecting statement.

## 6. Strategize and Summarize

- Close the interview.
- Ask the patient whether he/she wants to clarify something else.
- Offer an agenda for the next meeting.
# Kaye's Model

## 1. Prepare

- Know all the facts.
- Ensure privacy.
- Find out who the patient would like present.
- Introduce yourself.

## 2. Determine what the Patient Knows

- Start with open-ended questions (e.g., “How did it all start?”).

## 3. Determine if More Information is Wanted

- Do not force information on to the patient (e.g., “Would you like me to explain a bit more?”).

## 4. Give Warning Shots

- Not straight out with it! (e.g., “I’m afraid it looks rather serious”).

## 5. Allow Denial

- Denial is a defense mechanism and a way of coping.
- Allow the patient to control the amount of information he/she receives.

## 6. Explain if Requested

- Go step by step.
- Details might not be remembered, but the way you explain them will be.

## 7. Listen to Concerns

- Ask “What are your concerns at the moment?”.
- Allow time and space for answers.

## 8. Encourage Feelings

- Acknowledge the feelings.
- Be nonjudgmental.

## 9. Summarize

- Review concerns, plans for treatment.
- Foster hope.
- Offer written information if asked.

## 10. Follow up

- Offer further information.
- Assure patient of your continued availability.
# Dealing with an Aggressive Patient

## 1. Introductions
- Introduce yourself clearly and calmly.
- Explain your role and purpose of the interaction.

## 2. Safe Environment (Setting)
- Ensure the environment is safe for both the patient and healthcare staff.
- Arrange the setting to minimize potential risks (e.g., have an exit accessible, avoid having objects that can be used as weapons).
- Position yourself in a way that allows for a quick exit if necessary.

## 3. Acknowledge Feelings
- Recognize and validate the patient's feelings (e.g., "I can see that you are very upset and angry").
- Use empathetic statements to show understanding.

## 4. Determine Perception/Understanding (Perception)
- Ask the patient about their perception and understanding of the situation (e.g., "Can you tell me what has been bothering you?").
- Listen actively to their concerns and viewpoints.

## 5. Offer More Information (Invitation & Knowledge)
- Ask if the patient wants more information or clarification about their situation (e.g., "Would you like me to explain what is happening in more detail?").
- Provide clear, concise, and non-technical information.
- Avoid overwhelming the patient with too much information at once.

## 6. Encourage Questions
- Invite the patient to ask questions about their concerns or the information provided (e.g., "Do you have any questions or anything else you would like to know?").
- Answer their questions calmly and patiently.

## 7. Offer Support (Emotion/Empathy)
- Express your willingness to support the patient through their emotions (e.g., "I am here to help you and support you through this").
- Provide reassurance and outline the steps being taken to address their concerns.
- Suggest practical ways to manage their emotions (e.g., breathing exercises, talking to a counselor).
