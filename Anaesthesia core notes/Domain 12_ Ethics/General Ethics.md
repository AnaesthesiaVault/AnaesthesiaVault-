# Ethics

## Definition

Ethics, or moral philosophy, is a branch of philosophy concerned with norms and values, rights and wrongs, and what ought or ought not to be done. It involves reflection, argument, and analysis to determine what actions one should take under specific circumstances.

## Medical Ethics (Bioethics)

Medical ethics, or bioethics, involves the study and critical analysis of ethical issues that arise in the interrelationships between law, medicine, life sciences, theology, and biotechnology.

## Basic Theories of Right and Wrong Actions
1. **Utilitarianism:**
   - A moral theory that evaluates the consequences of an act.
   - The morality of an act is determined by its outcomes, exemplified by outcome measures for populations, such as vaccination.

2. **Deontological or Rights-Based Theories (Kantianism):**
   - Emphasizes that agents must act rationally and consistently to be moral.

3. **Virtue Ethics:**
   - Focuses on the character of the individual.
   - Includes feminist ethics, asserting that the rightness or wrongness of an action is embedded in the character of the individual.

4. **Four Principles Approach:**
   - A widely accepted framework in medical ethics, including principles like autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice.

# Drug/Medication Related Ethics

## Restricted Medications (Section 21)
#### Motivation

The Section 21 Unit of SAHPRA (Orthodox Medicines for Human Use) processes and evaluates applications from treating practitioners for access to unregistered medication within South Africa.

#### Obligations
1. Witnessed informed consent.
2. Regular progress reports.
3. Reporting any adverse events.
4. Submitting an application form, brochure, motivation, and evidence of good standing of the manufacturer.

## Off-Label Drug Use
#### Risks
1. **Clinical:**
   - Risks to the patient.
   - Risks to the practitioner (malpractice).

2. **Legal:**
   - Informed consent.
   - Regulatory framework prohibiting pharmaceutical companies from distributing literature on off-label use in South Africa.

3. **Ethical:**
   - Financial gain.
   - Balancing protecting the patient with professional judgment.

## SASSA Guidelines
1. May be indicated if sufficient evidence exists.
2. Written informed consent for off-label use (OLU).
3. Informing the patient about the benefits, risks, and consequences of OLU.
4. Explanation to the patient if no alternative exists.
5. Practitioner shares legal liability with all others in the supply chain.
6. Best to use for indications for which the drug may be registered elsewhere.
7. Establish the recorded safety with the pharmaceutical company.

## Anaesthetic Prescriptions
### SASSA Guidelines
1. Must be:
   - Clinically appropriate and indicated.
   - Based on diagnosis by personal examination or report.
   - The most cost-effective option.

2. Preference for certain products must be preceded by:
   - Diagnosis.
   - Indication.
   - Informing the patient of the available medicines.

3. The physical prescription must:
   - Be of the correct format.
   - Include the requisite information.
   - Have a personal and original signature.

4. Adherence to specific rules for higher schedule drugs, including consulting other specialists for longer durations.
5. Patient's consent for record-keeping and sharing of information with third parties.
6. No demanding remuneration for using certain products or companies.
7. Pharmacists must verify the authenticity of faxed, electronic, or telephonic scripts, with the original sent within seven working days.
# Medico-Legal

## Minimize the Medico-Legal Ramifications of a Complication
1. Act professionally at all times.
2. Keep meticulous records.
3. Know the guidelines and statements of your specialty and engage in Continuing Medical Education (CME).
4. Practice only the standards of care.
5. Adopt risk management and quality assurance protocols.
6. Understand your duties to the patient within the physician-patient relationship.
7. Take informed consent obligations seriously.
8. Never coerce a patient into accepting a given anesthetic plan.
9. Examine the patient and document preexisting conditions.
10. Know the patient's history and medication regimen.
11. Examine all laboratory data preoperatively, such as coagulation status.
12. Practice only those techniques in which you are fully trained and proficient.
13. Carry adequate malpractice insurance.
14. Avoid vicarious liability.
15. Respond appropriately when an incident occurs, including inter-disciplinary consultations and following up with the patient.

## Social Media

### HPCSA Guidelines Regarding Dissemination of Patient Information on Social Media
1. Health practitioners may share confidential information with:
   - a) Other members of the health care team involved in the patient's care.
   - b) Individuals who have the patient's consent.
   - c) If it is justified in the public interest.
   - d) If failure to do so will result in harm to the patient.
2. Obtain written consent from the patient, whether or not the patient can be identified by the data.
3. If the patient is under 12 years old, obtain written consent from a parent or guardian and assent from the minor.
4. Ensure that the patient cannot be identified from the shared information.
5. Ensure recipients understand that the information is given to them in confidence.
6. Share only the minimum necessary information to protect patient rights.
7. Be aware of the risk of mass dissemination of the information.
8. The obligation to keep patient information confidential remains even after the patient dies.

# Ethical Principles
## Autonomy
- **Definition**: The patient’s right to make their health care decisions without undue influence or coercion from their provider.
- **Respect for Autonomy**: This principle involves respecting the decision-making capacities of autonomous persons, allowing them to make reasoned informed choices. It includes:
  - **Autonomy of Thought**
  - **Autonomy of Intention**
  - **Autonomy of Action**
- **Professional Obligation**:
  - **Negative Obligation**: Healthcare providers must not constrain autonomous choice.
  - **Positive Obligation**: Providers must ensure patients can be as autonomous as possible by:
	- Properly disclosing information relevant to decision-making.
	- Actively promoting autonomy by ensuring understanding.
- **Context of Illness**: Illness often impairs autonomy, significantly so in critical care settings.

## Beneficence
- **Definition**: Healthcare professionals have a moral obligation to act in ways that benefit their patients.
- **Preventative Medicine and Public Health**: This principle underlies actions taken to prevent disease and promote health.
- **Limitations**:
  - **Risk Assessment**: The extent of risk healthcare professionals must take when treating patients is debated, especially in high-risk scenarios such as armed forces or pandemics.
  - **Conflict with Autonomy**: An autonomous patient can refuse treatment even if it is in their best interest, highlighting the tension between beneficence and autonomy.
  - **Other Factors**: Beneficence must be balanced with non-maleficence and justice.

## Best Interest Principle
### Decision-Making for Patients Lacking Capacity
- Considerations include:
  1. Clinically indicated options for investigation or treatment.
  2. Evidence of the patient’s previously expressed preferences, such as an advance statement.
  3. Knowledge of the patient’s background (cultural, religious, or employment considerations).
  4. Views from third parties familiar with the patient’s preferences (partner, family, carer, etc.).
  5. Options that least restrict the patient’s future choices.
- If the patient’s compromised state is temporary, wait for decisional capacity to return if possible. If not, medical intervention may proceed with the consent of an acceptable proxy or, in their absence, to prevent death or irreversible damage to health.
- In case of conflict between clinicians and proxies, seek legal advice or apply for a court order. In emergencies, intervention to prevent death or irreversible damage is permissible under the National Health Act.

### Child’s Best Interests
- The South African Constitution and the HPCSA stipulate that a child’s best interests are paramount in all matters concerning a child.

## Non-Maleficence
- **Definition**: The principle of non-harming is central to medicine.
- **Practical Consideration**: All treatments have the potential to cause harm. For example, invasive monitoring in the ICU poses risks and can cause discomfort or pain.
- **Proportionality**: The harm caused by treatment must be proportional to the benefit obtained.

## Justice
- **Definition**: Concerned with the fair distribution of health resources.
- **Distributive Justice**: Balances the obligations to individual patients with the responsibility to allocate resources fairly.
- **Resource Allocation**: Marginally beneficial intensive care may be limited based on societal consensus regarding the cost versus value of outcomes.
- **Pandemic Relevance**: Issues of justice are particularly significant in the context of pandemics, where resource allocation decisions can impact public health outcomes.

### Virtue Ethics

- (Plato) Four key virtues: wisdom, courage, temperance and justice.
- (Aristotle): when people acquire good habits of character, they are better able to regulate their emotions and their reason.
- Virtue ethicists thus think that right and wrong cannot be defined in terms of pre set moral principles or rules. The distinction is made between right and wrong by being sensitive to situations in a moral sense or expressing fundamentally good or admirable character traits.
- The motives and character of the agent are what counts. They help us reach morally correct decisions when we are faced with difficult choices.
- As a means of solving difficult ethical problems though it seems to have some disadvantages. How do we determine what is the “right” sort of character and how does just having the right sort of character ensure a correct decision? Similarly how do we distinguish or rank differing virtues. Perhaps as an ethical model it says more about the psychology of morality than the nature of moral truth.
