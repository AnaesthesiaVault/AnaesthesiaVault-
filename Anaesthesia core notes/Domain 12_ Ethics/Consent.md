# Informed Consent

## What is Consent
- **Medical Consent**: A decision or agreement to allow an intervention, seen as a continuously evolving process rather than a single event.
- **Capacity**: The ability to make such a decision.
- **Requirements**: Must be informed and free from duress.

## What is Shared Consent
- **Definition**: The reconciliation of two views:
  1. The physician as the medical expert.
  2. The patient with their individual values and viewpoints about present and future medical therapies.

### Key Characteristics of Shared Consent
1. At least two participants, the patient and physician, are involved.
2. Both parties share information.
3. Both parties build a consensus about preferred treatment.
4. An agreement is reached on the treatment to implement.

### Legal Standards for Informed Consent
- **Standards**:
  1. The reasonable physician standard.
  2. The reasonable patient standard.
  3. The subjective standard.

### Barriers and Facilitators of Shared Decision Making (SDM)
- **Barriers**:
  - Time constraints.
  - Lack of applicability due to patient characteristics or clinical situation.
- **Facilitators**:
  - Provider motivation.
  - Positive impact on the clinical process.
  - Improved patient outcomes.

### Requirements for Shared Consent
1. At least two participants, the patient and physician, are involved.
2. Both parties share information.
3. Both parties build a consensus about preferred treatment.
4. An agreement is reached on the treatment to implement.

## Summary of Informed Consent
- **Communication Process**: Consent is a communication process, not just a signature on a form.
- **Competence**: Competent adult patients can refuse or withdraw consent at any time.
- **Valid Consent**: Must come from a competent, informed person free from undue duress.
- **Presumption of Competence**: All adults are presumed competent unless proven otherwise.
- **Decisional Capacity**: Varies with the nature of the decision.
- **Surrogate Consent**: Provided by specified surrogates if a patient's decisional capacity is impaired.
- **Minors**: Children aged 12 and older can consent to medical treatment and surgery with parental or guardian assistance.
- **Full Information**: Including risks and options, must be provided for valid consent.
- **HIV Testing**: Without consent is illegal except in specific authorized circumstances.
- **Advance Directives**: Should be honored unless there is good reason to believe the patient changed their mind.

## Flow Chart for Obtaining Patient Consent

### Step 1: Threshold Elements
- Assess the patient’s decisional capacity.
- Ensure the patient is not under undue duress and can make a voluntary decision.

### Step 2: Informational Elements
- Describe the proposed intervention.
- Discuss the risks, benefits, and consequences of the proposed intervention, including costs or lack thereof.
- Verify that the patient understands the information and can make and communicate a rational decision based on that information.

### Step 3: Consent Elements
- The patient makes a decision.
- The patient communicates their decision and, if appropriate, signs a consent form (authorization).

### Step 4: Confirmation Elements
- Remind the patient that consent can be withdrawn at any time.
- If there is a delay between authorization and the procedure, confirm the patient’s willingness to proceed.

## Elements of Consent

### Moral Requirements
- **Autonomy**
- **Beneficence**
- **Nonmaleficence**
- **Justice**
- **Dignity**
- **Truthfulness/Honesty**

### Legal Requirements
1. **Capacity**:
   - **Age**: Minimum age requirement.
   - **Mental**: Ability to understand relevant information, consequences, risks/harm, and reason with the physician.
2. **Written**: Documentation of consent.
3. **Voluntariness**: No coercion; right to refuse.
4. **Information**:
   - Disclosure of health status.
   - Available treatment options.
   - Benefits.
   - Risks.
   - Costs.
   - Details of the treatment team.
## Age and Decisional Capcity
### Components Defining Capacity for Consent
1. **Age**
2. **Decisional Capacity**

#### Age
- **Determined by Legislation**: Full legal capacity is typically defined by age.
  - **18 Years Old**: Individuals aged 18 and older are presumed to have the decisional capacity to make choices on their own behalf, unless there is good reason to believe they have a mental impairment that compromises their ability to make specific decisions.
  - **12 Years Old**: Children aged 12 or older who have the maturity to understand the implications of a proposed treatment may consent on their own behalf. For surgical procedures, the child’s consent must be accompanied by a parent or guardian’s written assent.

#### Decisional Capacity
- **Principles of Decisional Capacity**:
  1. Adults are presumed to be competent to make decisions. Intervene without consent only if they lack the capacity to make a particular decision.
  2. Minors are generally presumed to lack decisional capacity. Intervene with their consent only if they have the capacity (maturity) to make a particular decision.

- **Definition**: Decisional capacity (also referred to as "mental capacity") involves the ability to make decisions in light of information about the relevant risks, benefits, and consequences of the proposed intervention. This includes:
  - Understanding relevant information.
  - Appreciating the consequences of the situation.
  - Reasoning about the treatment.
- **Considerations**:
  - Capacity can be decision-specific (e.g., different understandings of a sebaceous cyst vs. bowel resection).
  - Capacity can fluctuate over time.
  - If a patient’s decisional capacity is in doubt, an assessment should be conducted. This involves conveying information to the patient, discussing it to gauge understanding, and asking questions about the salient points to ensure comprehension. The focus should be on the reasoning the patient employs to arrive at a decision, rather than the choice itself.
  - Timing and location of the assessment should also be considered.
  - Even if they lack capacity, patients should be involved as much as possible in decisions that affect their lives.

### Decision Aid for Consent in Children

![](Pasted%20image%2020240516115012.png)

### Children Aged 12 and Older
- **Autonomous Consent**: Children aged 12 and older may consent on their own behalf if they have the maturity to understand the implications of the procedure.
- **Parental or Guardian Assent**: Requires written assent from a parent or guardian.

### Children Under 12 or Lacking Mental Capacity
- **Emergency Situations**:
  - **Unavailable Parent/Guardian**: If no person with parental responsibility is available:
	- The superintendent of the hospital, or the person in charge if the superintendent is unavailable, may give consent.
	- If neither is available, the healthcare practitioner may proceed with treatment if it is in the child's best interests and is limited to what is reasonably required in the emergency, as per HPCSA guidelines.
- **Non-Urgent Situations**:
  - **Application for Consent**: Must be made to the Minister of Social Development, who can provide consent in lieu of the child's parent or guardian.
- **Parental Refusal**:
  - **Risk to Child**: If a parent's refusal to consent places the child at risk, the matter should be referred to the hospital's social work department.
  - **Legal Intervention**: The social work department may petition the court for a ruling or apply to the Minister of Social Development for consent.

### Child Parents
- **Mature Child-Parent**: A child-parent of sufficient maturity may consent to medical or surgical treatment on behalf of their child.
- **Additional Assent**: For surgical treatments, the assent of the parent or guardian of the child-parent should also be obtained in writing on Form 35.

### Caesarean Section or Termination of Pregnancy (TOP)
- **No Age Cut-Off**: There is no age cut-off for consenting to a Caesarean section or TOP.

### General Considerations for Children Under 16 Years of Age
- **Competing Issues** (Proposed by Woolley):
  1. Capacity for consent.
  2. Parental authority.
  3. Prevailing view in case of a dispute between parent and child.
  4. Power of the court.

- **Refusal of Consent**:
  - **High Court Application**: An application to the High Court for a 'specific issue order' can be made to override parental authority.
  - **Best Interest of the Patient**: If there is insufficient time for a court application, doctors may act in the best interest of the patient.

### Deciding on Maturity
- **Capacity Assessment**: Interpretation of a 12-year-old’s capacity to understand risks involves:
  - Knowledge of the harm or risk.
  - Appreciation and understanding of the harm or risk.
  - Consent to or assumption of the risk.
  - Comprehensive understanding of the consent implications, as per HPCSA ethical guidelines.
### Children Aged 12 and Older
- **Autonomous Consent**: Children aged 12 and older may consent on their own behalf if they possess the maturity to understand the implications of the procedure.
- **Parental or Guardian Assent**: Requires written assent from a parent or guardian.

### Children Under 12 or Lacking Mental Capacity

#### Emergency Situations
- **Unavailable Parent/Guardian**: If no person with parental responsibility is available:

  - If neither is available, the healthcare practitioner may proceed with treatment if it is in the child's best interests and is limited to what is reasonably required in the emergency, as per HPCSA guidelines.

#### Non-Urgent Situations
- **Application for Consent**: Must be made to the Minister of Social Development, who can provide consent in lieu of the child's parent or guardian.

#### Parental Refusal
- **Risk to Child**: If a parent's refusal to consent places the child at risk, the matter should be referred to the hospital's social work department.
- **Legal Intervention**: The social work department may petition the court for a ruling or apply to the Minister of Social Development for consent.
### Information to Be provided

#### HPCSA Guidelines
- **Interpretation of a 12-Year-Old’s Capacity to Understand Risks**:
  - Knowledge of the harm or risk.
  - Appreciation and understanding of the harm or risk.

## Risk Overview

### Neurological Injury (ASRA 2015 Guideline)

- Peripheral neuropathy occurrence rates post-regional anesthesia:
	- **At 3 months:** 0–2.2%
	- **At 6 months:** 0–0.8%
	- **At 1 year:** 0–0.2%
- **Importance**: Understanding the trajectory of resolving injury is critical for discussing risks preoperatively and managing peripheral neuropathies postoperatively.

### Long-Term Incidence

- **Postoperative Neurological Symptoms**: Incidence of 5 in 10,000 patients (Second ASRA Evidence-Based Medicine Assessment, 2016).

### Ultrasound Guidance

- **Safety Benefits**:
	- Reduction in unintended vascular punctures and Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST).
	- Contemporary incidence of LAST: 2.6 per 10,000.
- **Note**: No strong evidence suggests ultrasound guidance reduces the incidence of peripheral nerve injury.

## Documentation Requirements

### Informed Consent

- **Written Consent**:
	- Not strictly mandatory in many jurisdictions.
	- Informed consent discussion should be documented in the patient’s chart.
	- Lack of documentation can lead to legal allegations following anesthetic complications.
	- Recommended: Written documentation of essential elements of the consent discussion (benefits, risks, alternatives).

### RA-UK Guidelines

- **Consent Discussion Should Include**:
	- **Benefits**: Early mobilization, less nausea, and vomiting.
	- **Process**: Use of ultrasound, needle insertion, block reversal.
	- **Alternatives**: General anesthesia, sedation.
	- **Protective Measures**: Precautions with an insensate limb (thermal and fall precautions), analgesic use as the block regresses.
	- **Risks**:
		- Block failure.
		- Common risks (incidence >1:100).
		- Less common but serious risks (pneumothorax, peripheral nerve injury).

### Documentation Recommendations

- Document the following:
	- **Capacity**: Assess if the patient can make a rational decision.
	- **Procedure Description**: Detail the procedure.
	- **Benefits**: Explain the benefits of the procedure.
	- **Complications**: Discuss common and rare complications.
	- **Alternatives**: Provide alternative options.
	- **Specific Patient Characteristics**: Any patient characteristics that might increase potential harm.
	- **Educational Resources**: Whether the patient was provided a pamphlet or resource about nerve blocks.

### Summary of Documentation Elements

1. **Capacity**: Ensure patient decision-making capability.
2. **Procedure Details**: Clearly describe the regional anesthesia procedure.
3. **Benefits**: Outline the benefits of regional anesthesia.
4. **Complications**: Discuss potential common and rare complications.
5. **Alternatives**: Present alternative anesthesia options.
6. **Patient-Specific Risks**: Note any individual factors that may increase risk.
7. **Educational Resources**: Confirm provision of informational materials to the patient.

# GSH Protocol for Consent 2022

## Elective / Non-Emergency Interventions
- Consent must be signed before any premedication is administered.
- Consent should be in writing, given voluntarily by a legally competent individual.
- Consent must be informed.

### 12 Years of Age or Older (but under 18 years)
- A child with sufficient maturity and mental competence to understand the benefits, risks, and implications of the operation, and who is assisted by a parent or guardian, may give consent for surgery. Use Consent Form 34 (Regulation 45, Section 129(3) of the Children’s Act 38 of 2005).
- If a competent child gives consent but the parents are unreachable, notify the relevant Manager: Medical Services (MMS) and document it in the patient folder.
- If a competent child gives consent and the parents oppose, obtain authority from a Social Worker at the Western Cape Government Social Services Department. Use Consent Form 33 (Regulation 47, Section 129(7) of the Children’s Act 38 of 2005). Contact: Tel. (021) 483-4621; Fax (021) 483-4481.
- Document whether the parent/guardian was consulted in the patient’s folder.
- Any person aged 12 or older may give consent for non-surgical medical treatment (e.g., prescription of oral contraceptives).

#### Parents
- A competent parent may give consent for surgery on a child:
  - Under the age of 12 years.
  - Over the age of 12 years but lacking sufficient maturity or mental competence.

### Child Under 12 Years of Age When Parental Consent is Not Available
- Make reasonable attempts to contact parents via provided address or telephone number, police, neighbors, or next of kin, with documentation by a social worker.
- If contact is unsuccessful, authority may be given by a social worker at the Western Cape Government Social Services Department.
- Obtaining written consent is the responsibility of the registered medical practitioner performing the intervention or their delegate. Nurses, interns, or students cannot obtain consent.
- Any person aged 14 years or older may sign as a witness, excluding the person obtaining consent. A witness affirms the identity of the signer, not the document content.
- Spousal consent is not legally required for permanent sterilization procedures.
- Informed consent must be obtained for each operation individually.

## Emergency Interventions

### Patients 12 Years and Older
- Obtain consent from the spouse, partner, or next available relative (in specific order). This consent may be verbal/telephonic but must be recorded on the consent form.
- If next of kin cannot be reached despite efforts, the doctor may proceed after notifying the MMS. The name of the MMS should be recorded on the consent form with confirmation by two witnesses.
- If delay may result in death or irreversible damage, the doctor may proceed without consent and without notifying the MMS.

### Patients Younger Than 12 Years of Age
- Obtain consent from a parent/curator/guardian if possible.
- In emergencies where consent is unobtainable, notify the MMS with authorization from the consultant on call.
- The attending doctor must assess the non-availability of the parent/guardian versus emergency status. Always seek the minor’s assent.

## Special Clinical Conditions

### Patients Certified in Terms of the Mental Health Care Act
- Involuntary and assisted mental health care users retain the right to consent to treatment for non-mental illnesses unless deemed incapable by a psychiatrist. In such cases, a court-appointed curator or closest family member may consent, or the CEO may approve treatment based on the surgeon's recommendation.

### Termination of Pregnancy Interventions
- Requires informed consent from the pregnant woman.
- For pregnant minors, a medical practitioner or registered midwife should advise consultation with parents or guardians but cannot deny termination if the minor opts out of consultation.
- The minor must complete part 1 of the “Statement by Minor who requests the Termination of her Pregnancy”.
- Consent also covers further surgical procedures to treat complications. Inform the MMS responsible for Obstetrics and Gynaecology before termination procedures on minors.

### Consent for HIV/Hepatitis B/Hepatitis C Testing
- May be given verbally after adequate pre-test counseling, documented in the patient’s folder.
- Children 12 years and older may consent to their own HIV test.

#### Needle Prick Incidents
- Seek patient consent with preand post-test counseling.
- If the patient refuses or is unconscious, HIV testing without consent is not permitted. Options include:
  - Treating the healthcare worker as if the patient is HIV-positive.
  - Testing an existing blood sample with post-test patient notification.
  - Using a blood sample obtained for legitimate medical reasons.
  - Offering anonymous testing with documented patient agreement.
  - Following normal guidelines for patients incapable of consenting (e.g., mentally ill or under 12 years).

### Blood Transfusions
- Requires explicit, informed consent detailing risks, indications, and benefits.
- In emergencies, if consent cannot be obtained, proceed on clinical grounds alone and document in the patient’s file.

### Consent for Intra-Operative Photography
- Obtain prior consent for photographic studies, documented in the patient’s notes.
- If unforeseen, obtain post-operative verbal consent and delete images if the patient objects. Ensure patient anonymity in images.
- For identifiable images, complete a separate consent form.

### Consent for Sterilization

#### Patient Capable of Consenting
- Patients 18 years or older may consent to sterilization.
- Patients under 18 years may be sterilized if necessary for health, with:
  - Patient willingness.
  - Consent from the patient and a legal guardian.
  - An independent medical practitioner’s written opinion.
  - Sterilization Panel approval and relevant documentation.

#### Patient Incapable of Consenting
- Sterilization for mentally disabled patients involves referral to a social worker, psychiatry, and an O&G specialist, and panel evaluation with complete documentation and guardian involvement.

### Consent for Transplantation of Donor Organs
- The Transplant Coordinator obtains informed consent from a relative.
- If identity is unknown or no contactable family, the hospital will not proceed.
- Consent for organ donation must be obtained prior to certification of death in cases of cardiac death. The Transplant Coordinator consults with the Surgical MMS for permission to proceed.
