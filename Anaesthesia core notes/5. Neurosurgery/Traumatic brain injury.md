# Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Management Overview

## Initial Considerations
- **Trauma/ATLS Approach:** Adherence to Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocols is essential.
- **Possible C-spine Injury:** Assume C-spine injury until ruled out.
- **Monitoring & Managing Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP):** Mitigate the risk of cerebral ischemia and brain herniation.

## Prevention of Secondary Brain Injury
- **Avoid Hypoxia:** Maintain PaO₂ > 60 mmHg.
- **Avoid Hypercarbia:** Keep PaCO₂ at 35 mmHg.
- **Maintain Adequate Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP):** Target 60-70 mmHg.
- **Avoid Hyperglycemia and Hyperthermia:** These can exacerbate brain injury.

## Multisystem Complications
### Central Nervous System (CNS)
- Herniation
- Seizures

### Cardiovascular System (CVS)
- Myocardial dysfunction and ST changes
- Arrhythmias

### Pulmonary System
- Neurogenic pulmonary edema

### Hematologic
- Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy (DIC)

### Endocrine
- Diabetes Insipidus (DI)
- Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH (SIADH)
- Cerebral Salt Wasting (CSW)

## Neurosurgical Considerations
- Limited airway access
- Optimization of surgical exposure
- Invasive monitoring

## Indications for Intubation
- **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤ 8**
- **Significant Deterioration in Consciousness:** A fall in GCS of two points or more, or a fall in motor score of one point or more.
- **Loss of Protective Laryngeal Reflexes**
- **Failure to Achieve PaO₂ ≥ 13 kPa:** Lower targets may be accepted in acute ischemic stroke patients (aim for peripheral oxygen saturation ≥ 95%).
- **Hypercarbia:** PaCO₂ > 6 kPa
- **Spontaneous Hyperventilation:** PaCO₂ < 4.0 kPa
- **Bilateral Fractured Mandible**
- **Copious Bleeding into the Mouth:** For example, from a skull base fracture.
- **Seizures**

### Complications of Intubation
- Venous air embolism
- Hemorrhage
- Arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability

### Thresholds for Avoiding Secondary Insults

- **ICP**: <20-22 mmHg
- **CPP**: ≥60 mmHg (optimal target 60-70 mmHg, depends on autoregulatory status)
- **Systolic Blood Pressure (BT)**: >100 mmHg
- **pO₂**: >10 kPa
- **O₂ Saturation**: >95%
- **pCO₂**: 4.5-5.5 kPa
- **Temperature**: <38°C
- **Blood Glucose (β-Glucose)**: 5-10 mmol/L
- **Serum Sodium (S-Na)**: 140-150 mmol/L

## ICP Lowering Options

- **Always consider**: Is there a mass lesion in need of evacuation?
1. **Positioning**: Head in neutral position, avoid neck extension to optimize jugular vein effluent.
2. **Head of Bed (HOB)**: Elevated to 15-30°, treat fever.
3. **Pain Relief and Sedation**: Optimize.
4. **Fluid Balance**: Maintain normal or negative fluid balance.
5. **Osmotherapy**:
   - 3% NaCl or Mannitol; 0.25-0.5 g/kg of 20% solution over 10-15 minutes.
6. **Serum Sodium**: Optimize to 145-150 mmol/L.
7. **Seizure Monitoring**: High suspicion of seizures; consider continuous EEG monitoring.
8. **Analgesia and Sedation**: Increase as needed.
9. **Serum Sodium Adjustment**:
   - Increase to 150-155 mmol/L, consider moderate hyperventilation (pCO₂ 4.0-4.5 kPa).
10. **Consider Additional Medications**:
	- Ketamine.
	- Barbiturates.
11. **Hypothermia**: Mild hypothermia (34-35°C).
12. **Surgical Intervention**: Decompressive hemicraniectomy.

### Reversal Strategy for TBI Patients on Anticoagulant Therapy

- **Warfarin**:
  - If INR >1.3, use PCC + Vitamin K (effect onset 12-24h).
- **Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)**:
  - **Dabigatran**: Administer Praxbind (Idarucizumab) 5g IV.
  - **Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, Edoxaban**: Administer PCC.

### Summary of Key Management Strategies

- **Monitor ICP and CPP**: Maintain ICP <20-22 mmHg and CPP ≥60 mmHg.
- **Prevent Secondary Insults**: Optimize systemic parameters including blood pressure, oxygenation, and temperature.
- **Intervene Appropriately**: Utilize pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures to manage ICP and ensure adequate cerebral perfusion.
- **Optimize Seizure Control**: Continuous monitoring and appropriate prophylactic/therapeutic interventions.
- **Reverse Anticoagulation**: Follow specific protocols for patients on anticoagulants, using PCC, Vitamin K, or specific antidotes as necessary.

# Management Goals
- **Assess Severity of TBI**
- **Prevent Secondary Brain Injury:**
  - Avoid hypoxia (PaO₂ > 60 mmHg)
  - Prevent hypercarbia (PaCO₂ 35 mmHg)
  - Maintain CPP ~ 60 mmHg (MAP ~ 80)
  - Avoid abrupt increases in BP and ICP (< 20-25 mmHg)
  - Avoid hyperthermia and hyperglycemia
  - Maintain C-spine precautions
  - Ensure Hct > 30

# Treatment of Increased ICP
- **Elevate Head of Bed (HOB)**
- **Loosen Collars and Endotracheal Tube (ETT) Ties** to promote venous drainage
- **Decrease Intrathoracic Pressures:** Adjust ventilator settings, decrease PEEP
- **Brief Hyperventilation:** Reduce PaCO₂ to 30 for ~30 minutes
- **Sedation, Analgesia, Paralysis**

- **Hypothermia or Normothermia**
- **Mannitol:** 0.5-1 g/kg
- **Furosemide:** 0.25-0.5 mg/kg
- **Hypertonic Saline:** 6-8 ml/kg of 3% saline
- **Correct Sodium and Osmolality Levels**
- **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Drainage**
- **Surgical Decompression:** Consider head and abdominal decompression

# Pediatric TBI Guidelines
- **Decompressive Craniectomy:** Indicated for deterioration, imminent herniation, or ICP refractory to medical management.
- **Prophylactic Hypothermia (32-33 degrees):** Improves ICP control but does not significantly improve outcomes.
- **Osmotherapy:** 3% NaCl solution, 2-5 ml/kg bolus, plus/minus IVI 0.1-1 ml/kg/hr.
- **CSF Drainage:** External Ventricular Drainage (EVD) with continuous drainage.
- **Sedation:** High-dose barbiturates for refractory raised ICP (if cardiovascular stable).
- **Nutrition:** Early enteral feeding recommended.
- **Seizure Prophylaxis:** Recommended.
- **ICP Monitoring:** Treatment threshold of 20 mmHg.
- **CPP Monitoring:** Aim for CPP between 40-50 mmHg.

## Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (4th Edition)

### Overview

The Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) focuses on improving outcomes for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients by developing evidence-based guidelines rather than comprehensive protocols. The 4th Edition of these guidelines incorporates data from 189 publications, including 5 Class 1 studies, 46 Class 2 studies, 136 Class 3 studies, and 2 meta-analyses. These support 28 recommendations covering 18 topics. This edition reflects an increase in the quality and precision of recommendations and addresses ongoing evidence gaps. The guidelines are designed as 'Living Guidelines' with continuous literature monitoring and updates, rather than a new edition.

### Evidence Classification and Recommendations
- **Class 1:** High-quality RCTs
- **Class 2:** Moderate-quality RCTs, good-quality cohort or case-control studies
- **Class 3:** Low-quality RCTs, moderateto low-quality cohort or case-control studies, case series
- **Level I:** High-quality evidence
- **Level IIA:** Moderate-quality evidence
- **Level IIB:** Low-quality evidence
- **Level III:** Low-quality evidence, often indirect

### Topics and Recommendations

#### 1. Decompressive Craniectomy (DC)
- **Level I:** No recommendations due to insufficient evidence.
- **Level IIA:**
  - Bifrontal DC is not recommended to improve outcomes in patients with diffuse injury and refractory intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation.
  - Large frontotemporoparietal DC is recommended over small DC for better outcomes in severe TBI patients.
  
#### 2. Prophylactic Hypothermia
- **Level I and IIA:** No recommendations due to insufficient evidence.
- **Level IIB:** Early, short-term prophylactic hypothermia is not recommended for diffuse injury patients.

#### 3. Hyperosmolar Therapy
- **Level I, II, and III:** Insufficient evidence to support specific recommendations for hyperosmolar agents (mannitol or hypertonic saline) to improve clinical outcomes in severe TBI patients.

#### 4. Cerebrospinal Fluid Drainage
- **Level I and II:** No recommendations due to insufficient evidence.
- **Level III:**
  - Continuous CSF drainage may be considered to lower ICP.
  - CSF drainage may be considered in patients with an initial GCS < 6 within the first 12 hours post-injury.

#### 5. Ventilation Therapies
- **Level I and IIA:** No recommendations due to insufficient evidence.
- **Level IIB:** Prolonged prophylactic hyperventilation with PaCO2 ≤ 25 mmHg is not recommended.

#### 6. Anaesthetics, Analgesics, and Sedatives
- **Level I and IIA:** No recommendations due to insufficient evidence.
- **Level IIB:**
  - Barbiturates for burst suppression are not recommended for intracranial hypertension prophylaxis.
  - High-dose barbiturates are recommended for refractory ICP control, ensuring haemodynamic stability.
  - Propofol is recommended for ICP control but not for mortality or six-month outcome improvement.

#### 7. Steroids
- **Level I:** Steroids are not recommended for outcome improvement or ICP reduction. High-dose methylprednisolone is associated with increased mortality and is contraindicated.

#### 8. Nutrition
- **Level I:** No recommendations due to insufficient evidence.
- **Level IIA:** Feeding to achieve basal caloric needs by day 5-7 post-injury is recommended to decrease mortality.
- **Level IIB:** Transgastric jejunal feeding is recommended to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia.

#### 9. Infection Prophylaxis
- **Level I:** No recommendations due to insufficient evidence.
- **Level IIA:** Early tracheostomy is recommended to reduce ventilation days, but not mortality or pneumonia rates. Povidone-iodine oral care is not recommended.
- **Level III:** Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters may be used to prevent EVD-related infections.

#### 10. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis
- **Level I and II:** No recommendations due to insufficient evidence.
- **Level III:**
  - LMWH or low-dose unfractionated heparin with mechanical prophylaxis may be used, considering the risk of haemorrhage expansion.
  - Insufficient evidence to prefer a specific agent, dose, or timing.

#### 11. Seizure Prophylaxis
- **Level I:** No recommendations due to insufficient evidence.
- **Level IIA:**
  - Prophylactic phenytoin or valproate is not recommended for late PTS prevention.
  - Phenytoin is recommended for early PTS reduction, though early PTS does not worsen outcomes.
  - Insufficient evidence to recommend levetiracetam over phenytoin for early PTS.

### Conclusion

The BTF guidelines for managing severe TBI are evidence-based, incorporating the latest research to provide clinicians with recommendations aimed at improving patient outcomes. Continuous updates will ensure that these guidelines remain current and reflective of the latest evidence.

## Updated Monitoring Recommendations

### Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitoring

**Level IIB Recommendations**
- **Indication**: ICP monitoring is recommended in the management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients to reduce in-hospital and 2-week post-injury mortality.
- **Criteria**: ICP should be monitored in all salvageable patients with a TBI (GCS 3-8 after resuscitation) and an abnormal CT scan. An abnormal CT scan of the head is characterized by haematomas, contusions, swelling, herniation, or compressed basal cisterns.
- **Additional Indication**: ICP monitoring is indicated in patients with severe TBI and a normal CT scan if ≥ 2 of the following features are present at admission: age > 40 years, unilateral or bilateral motor posturing, or systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg.

### Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) Monitoring

**Level IIB Recommendations**
- **Indication**: Management of severe TBI patients using guidelines-based CPP monitoring is recommended to decrease 2-week mortality.

### Advanced Cerebral Monitoring

**Level IIB Recommendations**
- **Jugular Bulb Monitoring**: Monitoring arteriovenous oxygen content difference (AVDO2) via jugular bulb can be considered to reduce mortality and improve outcomes at 3 and 6 months post-injury.

### Additional Recommendations

**Management of Impending Cerebral Herniation**
- **Signs**: Asymmetric pupil size, abnormal posturing, Cushing’s triad (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respiration).
- **Interventions**: Intubation and hyperventilation to a PaCO2 of 25-30 mmHg. Administration of mannitol or hypertonic saline.

**Comparison of Mannitol and Hypertonic Saline**
- **Mannitol**: Dose of 0.25-1 g/kg every 4-6 hours. Risks include hypovolemia, rebound cerebral edema, and necessitates monitoring serum osmolality and renal function.
- **Hypertonic Saline**: Administered via central venous line as a 3% infusion or 23.4% bolus (30 ml over 10 minutes). Preferable in settings of blood loss, hypovolemia, or hypotension. Risks include circulatory overload, pulmonary edema, and metabolic acidosis. Requires meticulous management of electrolytes and fluid balance.

**Refractory Intracranial Hypertension**
- **Modalities**: Decompressive craniectomy, barbiturate coma, induced hypothermia.

**Neurological Monitoring**
- **Frequency**: Serial neurological examinations every 1-2 hours for the first 24-48 hours.
- **Repeat CT Scan**: Indicated for patients with hemorrhage-related severe TBI six hours post-injury.

**Hemodynamic Management**
- **Fluid Choice**: Isotonic saline to maintain euvolemia.
- **Blood Pressure**: Avoid hypotension. Cerebral autoregulation impairment ("pressure passive") requires careful management to avoid increased ICP due to elevated MAP.

### Updated Recommendations: Thresholds

**Blood Pressure Thresholds (Level III)**
- **Age 50-69**: Maintain SBP ≥ 100 mmHg.
- **Age 15-49 and > 70**: Maintain SBP ≥ 110 mmHg.

**Intracranial Pressure Thresholds**
- **Level IIB**: Treat ICP > 22 mmHg to reduce mortality.
- **Level III**: Use a combination of ICP values, clinical assessment, and brain CT findings for management decisions.

**Cerebral Perfusion Pressure Thresholds**
- **Level IIB**: Target CPP value for survival and favorable outcomes is between 60-70 mmHg.
- **Level III**: Avoid aggressive CPP > 70 mmHg to reduce the risk of adult respiratory failure.

**Advanced Cerebral Monitoring Thresholds (Level III)**
- **Jugular Venous Saturation**: Avoid jugular venous saturation < 50% to improve outcomes.

**Note:** The recommendations may need updates based on the results of the RESCUEicp trial. Further information is available at [Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines](https://braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines).
