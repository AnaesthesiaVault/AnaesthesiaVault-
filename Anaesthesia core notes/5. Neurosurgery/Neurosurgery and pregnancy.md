# Introduction

## Reasons for Neurosurgery in Pregnant Patients
- **Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)**
- **Trauma**
- **Tumors**
- **Spine Pathology**
- **Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt (VPS) Issues**

## Timing of Surgery
- **>24 Weeks Gestation**
  - Consideration must be given to early delivery and the timing of delivery related to any neurosurgical intervention.
  - Options include:
	1. Delivery by Caesarean section followed by neurosurgery as continuous procedures.
	2. Delivery by Caesarean section with neurosurgery at a later date.
	3. Maintain pregnancy and proceed with neurosurgery.
- **<24 Weeks Gestation**
  - No option to deliver; neurosurgical intervention can proceed.
## Anaesthesia

1. **Coordinated Multidisciplinary Team (MDT)**
2. **Left Lateral (LL) Tilt for Patients ≥ 20 Weeks Gestation**
3. **Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI)**
4. **Avoid Intubation Response**
5. **Use of Short-acting Opioids**
6. **Spinal Surgery**
   - Special considerations for patient positioning.
   - Typically performed in the prone position, which provides good utero-placental perfusion but presents mechanical challenges in pregnant patients.
   - Case reports exist of spinal surgery performed prone under regional anaesthesia, with patients positioning themselves prone prior to surgery.
7. **Patients Should Be Fully Awake and Have Intact Airway Reflexes**
8. **Commonly Administered Peri-Operative Drugs**
   - Steroids (e.g., dexamethasone)
   - Osmotic diuretics (e.g., mannitol)
   - Calcium channel antagonists (e.g., nimodipine) in cases of SAH to prevent cerebral vasospasm.

# Ruptured Cerebral Aneurysm Management

**Gestation: Less than 26 weeks**
- Proceed as best for mother

**Gestation: 26–34 weeks**
- **Stable patient**
  - Proceed as best for mother
- **Unstable patient**
  - Proceed as best for mother

**Gestation: More than 34 weeks**
- Caesarean section followed by aneurysm exclusion

# Symptomatic Brain Tumor Management

**1st and Early 2nd Trimester**
- **Stable**
  - Permit gestational advancement
	- Early 2nd trimester neurosurgery, adjuvant radiotherapy
- **Unstable**
  - Neurosurgery

**Late 2nd and Early 3rd Trimester**
- **Stable**
  - Permit gestational advancement
	- Vaginal delivery possible
- **Progressive neurology**
  - Possible radiotherapy
- **Unstable**
  - Caesarean section and neurosurgery

**Term**
- **Stable**
  - Vaginal delivery possible
- **Unstable**
  - Caesarean section and neurosurgery
