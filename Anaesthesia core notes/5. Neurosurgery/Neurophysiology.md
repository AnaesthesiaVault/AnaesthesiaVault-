# Introduction
- Brain consumes 20% of body oxygen. 60% used to form ATP and support neuronal activity
- CM02 = 3-3.8ml/100g/min. Greatest in grey matter (more sensitive to hypoxia)
- Rapid 02 consumption + no reserves + no supply= Unconscious in 10 sec. 3-8 min until irreversible injury (ATP depleted)
- Glucose is the primary energy store and parallels CMR02. Relationship is not maintained during starvation, when ketone bodies (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate) also become major energy substrates
- Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia (accelerating cerebral acidosis and cellular injury) damages the brain.
# Cerebral Blood Flow
- CBF averages 50 mL/100g/min at a PaCO2 of 40mmHg (Gray matter 80 mL/100g/min, white matter 20 mL/100 g/min)
- 750ml/min (15-20% of CO)
- Below 25ml/100g/min there will be impairement
- 02 tension 20-50mmHg. <20mmHg must be investigated
## Regulation of Cerebral Blood Flow

### CPP and Autoregulation
- MAP–ICP (or CVP) = CPP.
- Normally 80 to 100 mm Hg.
- ICP is normally less than 10 mm Hg, CPP is primarily dependent on MAP
- Cerebral vasculature rapidly adapts (<1min) to changes in CPP. Increased CPP: Vasoconstriction. Decreased CPP: Vasodilation
- Autoregulated between MAPs 60 and 160 mmHg. If outside of these limits it becomes pressure depended. MAP >150mmHg damages the BBB.
![[image-940-x139-y494.png]]
 - Shifted to the right in patients with chronic arterial hypertension

### Extrinsic Mechanisms
#### C02
- CBF is directly proportionate to PaCO2 20 and 80 mmHg
- Blood flow changes approximately 1 to 2 mL/100 g/min per 1mmHg in PaCO2. Immediate effect
- Secondary to changes in the pH of CSF and cerebral tissue.
- Ions do not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, but CO2 does, acute changes in PaCO2 but not HCO3–affect CBF. Thus, acute metabolic acidosis has little effect on CBF because hydrogen ions (H+) cannot readily cross the blood–brain barrier.
- After 24 to 48 h, CSF HCO3–ion concentration adjusts to compensate for the change in PaC2 O, so the effects of hypocapnia and hypercapnia are diminished
- Marked hyperventilation: (PaCO2 <20 mm Hg) shifts the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left and, with changes in CBF, may result in EEG changes suggestive of cerebral impairment, even in normal individual.

#### P02
- Hyperoxia may be associated with only minimal decreases (–10%) in CBF
- Severe hypoxemia (PaO2 <50 mm Hg) greatly increases CBF
#### Temperature
- CBF changes 5% to 7% per 1°C change in temperature.
- Hypothermia decreases both CMR and CBF, whereas hyperthermia has the reverse effect
#### Viscosity

A decrease in haematocrit decreases viscosity and can improve CBF.  
30% HCT recommended (too long and you impair 02 delivery)

#### Autonomic Influences

Sympathetic (vasoconstrictive) and parasympathetic (vasodilatory) systems.

## Measurement of Perfusion
**NIRS (near infrared spectrometry)**
	Similar concept to oximetry.
	Detects changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated Hb.
	Uses Bier lambert law
Unable to distinguish between venous and arterial Hb so gives a regional Satsbest used as a trend. Example = INVOS.
**Intracerebral O2 electrode:**
	Placed in parenchyma, detects regional sats, example = Licox
**Microdialysis catheter:** 
	Measures concentration of glucose, pyruvate and lactate in interstitial fluid.
	Mainly lab based.
**Jugular venous sats (jugular bulb oxygen saturation)**
	Retrograde CVP inserted into side of injury, normal =55-75%. Absolute, not a regional, measurement. 
	Hyperaemic >75%
	Normal range 55-75%
	Critical 50-55%
	Pathological <50%
**PET scan:**
	Gold standard.
	Radiolabelled O2. 
	Not practical for serial measurements.
**Cranial Doppler US**
**EEG processing**
**Somatosensory evoked potentials (usually auditory)**

# Blood Brain Barrier
- Endothelial cells are almost fused, the absence of pores gives it the name.
- Movement of a given substance across the blood–brain barrier is governed simultaneously by its size, charge, lipid solubility, and degree of protein binding in blood
- Carbon dioxide, oxygen, and lipid-soluble molecules (such as most anesthetics) freely enter the brain, whereas most ions, proteins, and large substances (such as mannitol) penetrate poorly
- Water moves freely across the blood–brain barrier as a consequence of bulk flow, whereas movement of even small ions is impeded (the equilibration half-life of Na + is 2–4 h). As a result, rapid changes in plasma electrolyte concentrations (and, secondarily, osmolality) produce a transient osmotic gradient between plasma and the brain.
- Acute hypertonicity of **plasma** results in net movement of water out of the brain, whereas acute hypotonicity causes a net movement of water into the brain. These effects are short-lived as equilibration eventually occurs, but when marked, they can cause rapid fluid shifts in the brain.
- Mannitol, an osmotically active substance that does not normally cross the blood–brain barrier, causes a sustained decrease in brain water content and is often used to acutely decrease brain volume
## Disrupted by
- Severe hypertension, tumors, trauma, strokes, infection, marked hypercapnia, hypoxia, and sustained seizure activity.
- Under these conditions, fluid movement across the blood–brain barrier becomes dependent on hydrostatic pressure rather than osmotic gradients.
# CSF
- CSF cushions the central nervous system (CNS) against trauma and helps clear waste products.
- CSF is formed by the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricle (21ml/h or 500ml/day). Total 150ml in adult
- CSF flows from the lateral ventricles through the intraventricular foramina (of Monro) into the third ventricle, through the cerebral aqueduct (of Sylvius) into the fourth ventricle, and through the median aperture of the fourth ventricle (foramen of Magendie) and the lateral apertures of the fourth ventricle (foramina of Luschka) into the cerebellomedullary cistern (cisterna magna).
- **Decreases CSF production:** Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide), corticosteroids, spironolactone, furosemide, isoflurane, and vasoconstrictors
# ICP
- Cranial vault is a rigid structure with a fixed total volume, containing brain (80%), blood (12%), and CSF (8%).
- Any increase in one component must be offset by an equivalent decrease in another to prevent a rise in ICP
- Normal less than 10mmHg
## Compensatory Mechanisms

(1) an initial displacement of CSF from the cranial to the spinal compartment

(2) an increase in CSF absorption

(3) a decrease in CSF production, and

(4) a decrease in total cerebral blood volume (primarily venous)

## Herniation
1) the cingulate gyrus under the falx cerebri
2) the uncinate gyrus through the tentorium cerebelli
3) the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum
4) Any area beneath a defect in the skull (transcalvarial).

# Effect of Anaesthetic Agents on Cerebral Physiology

![[image-948-x46-y432.png]]

## Inhalational Agents
- **Concentration-dependent decreases in CMR02:** Halothane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and isoflurane produce. Isoflurane produces the greatest maximal depression (up to 50% reduction), whereas halothane has the least effect (<25% reduction)
- **Concentration-dependent dilatation of cerebral vessels and increased CBF:** Halothane has the greatest effect on CBF; at concentrations greater than 1%
- **Concentrationdepended disruption of cerebral autoregulation**
- Halothane increases CBF up to 200%, compared with 20% for isoflurane or desflurane. Sevoflurane produces the least cerebral vasodilation
- CBF also seems to be time dependent because, with continued administration (2–5 h), blood flow begins to return to normal.
- Response to C02 retained. *Hyperventilation (hypocapnia) can therefore abolish or blunt the initial effects and prevent increases of CBF and ICP*
- Volatile agents alter, but do not uncouple the normal relationship of CBF and CMR.
- **Luxury perfusion=** Decreased CMR02 and Increased CBF
- Potentially beneficial effect during global ischemia, a detrimental circulatory steal phenomenon is possible in focal ischemia. Increase CBF in normal areas of the brain but not in ischemic areas, where arterioles are already maximally vasodilated. The end result may be a redistribution (“steal”) of blood flow away from ischemic to normal areas.
- Halothane impedes absorption of CSF
- Isoflurane facilitates absorption (agent of choice in neurosurgery)
- N20 minimal changes
- Net effect of volatile anaesthetics on ICP is the result of immediate changes in cerebral blood volume, delayed alterations on CSF dynamics, and arterial CO 2 tension
## IV Agents
- All intravenous agents either have little effect on or reduce CMR and CBF (except Ketamine). Cerebral autoregulation and CO2 responsiveness are preserved with all agents.
### Barbiturates

(1) hypnosis

(2) depression of CMR (uniformly throughout the brain)

(3) reduction of CBF due to increased cerebral vascular resistance in normal areas, this redistribute blood flow from normal to ischemic areas in the brain. The cerebral vasculature in ischemic areas remains maximally dilated because of ischemic vasomotor paralysis

(4) anticonvulsant activity.

(5) Dose-dependent decreases in CMR and CBF until the EEG becomes isoelectric

(6) facilitate absorption of CSF

### Opioids
- Opioids Opioids generally have minimal effects on CBF, CMR, and ICP, unless PaC02 rises secondary to respiratory depression
### Etomidate
- Decreases the CMR, CBF, and ICP
- Effect on CMR is nonuniform, affecting the cortex more than the brainstem
- Decreases production and enhances absorption of CSF
### Propofol
- Similar to barbiturates. Reduces CBF and CMR
- Significant anticonvulsant activity
- Most commonly used agent
### BZD
- Lower CBF and CMR, but to a lesser extent than barbiturates, etomidate, or propofol
- Anticonvulsant activity
### Ketamine
- Dilates the cerebral vasculature and increases CBF (50–60%)
- No change is CMR02 due to selective activation of certain areas (limbic and reticular) offset by depression of other areas (somatosensory and auditory)
- Impede the absorption of CSF without affecting formation
- Ketamine administration does not increase ICP in neurologically impaired patients under controlled ventilation with concomitant administration of propofol or a benzodiazepine.
- Neuroprotective: (NMDA) receptor blockage during periods of increased glutamate concentrations protective against cell death
![[image-953-x33-y132.png]]
### Lidocaine
- Decreases CMR, CBF, and ICP, but to a lesser degree than other agents.
- Its principal advantage is that it decreases CBF (by increasing cerebral vasculature)
- May also have neuroprotective effects
### Dexmedetomidine
- Reduces CBF and CMR
- Possibly neuroprotective in TBI
### Vasopressors
- With normal autoregulation and an intact BBB, vasopressors increase CBF only when MAP is below 60 mmHg or above 160 mmHg
- In the absence of autoregulation, vasopressors increase CBF by their effect on CPP
- Changes in CMR generally parallel those in blood flow.
- βAdrenergic agents seem to have a greater effect on the brain when the blood–brain barrier is disrupted; central β1-receptor stimulation increases CMR and blood flow.
- βAdrenergic blockers generally have no direct effect on CMR or CBF.
### Vasodilators
- Cerebral vasodilation and increase CBF in a dose-related fashion

# Cerebral Ischaemia
- CBF decreases below 10 mL/100 g/min: cell function is deranged, and ion pumps fail to maintain cellular vitality. The ratio of lactate to pyruvate is increased secondary to anaerobic metabolism.
- ATP pump failure: Intracellular K+ decreases, and intracellular Na+ increases, intracellular Ca2+ increases
- Release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate
- Glutamate acts at the NMDA receptor, further enhancing Ca 2+ entry into the cell, hence the potential benefit of NMDA blockers for neuroprotection
- Sustained increases in intracellular Ca2+ activate lipases and proteases, which initiate and propagate structural damage to neurons.
- Increases in free fatty acid concentration and cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities result in the formation of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, some of which are potent mediators of cellular injury.
- Accumulation of toxic metabolites impairs cellular function and interferes with repair mechanisms.
- Reperfusion of ischemic tissues can cause additional tissue damage due to the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals.
- Inflammation and edema can promote further neuronal damage, leading to cellular apoptosis
# Brain Protection to Prevent Secondary Brain Injury

- Normothermia  
- Euglycemia: 5-10mmol
- Normocarbia PaC02: 4.3-4.8kpa
- Oxygen: Pa02 >8kpa. S02: 90-94%
- CPP: 60-80. Thus MAP: >80. Avoid spikes in BP (blunt intubation response)
- Hct more than 30%
- Decrease intrathoracic pressures
- Manage seizures actively
- Mechanical: Head up, prevent constrictive dressings and collars
- Use isoflurane (hyperventilation during induction max 30 min), ketamine, propofol, lidocaine
