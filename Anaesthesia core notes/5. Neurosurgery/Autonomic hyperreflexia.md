# Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314171326.png)

## Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

### Noxious Stimuli
- Examples: Bladder/bowel distension

### Pathophysiology
1. **Noxious stimuli** activate **pain fibers**, sending an **afferent impulse** to the spinal cord.
2. This triggers a **generalized sympathetic response**.
3. Resulting in an **increase in blood pressure**.

### Clinical Features and Consequences
- **Arrhythmia**
- **Intracranial pressure increases**
- **Pulmonary edema**
- **Renal insufficiency**
- **Seizures**
- **Stroke**
- **Death**

### Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD)
- **Definition**: A condition associated with spinal cord injury (SCI) typically at T6 or above.
- **Risk Factors**: Higher level SCI and complete lesions.

#### Mechanism
- **Above the level of injury**:
  - Carotid baroreceptors sense the increased blood pressure.
  - **Vagus nerve-mediated parasympathetic response** increases.
  - Dysregulated parasympathetic response occurs only above the SCI.
- **Below the level of injury**:
  - SCI blocks descending inhibitory signals to preganglionic sympathetic neurons.
  - Leads to an **increased sympathetic response**.
  - Causes **splanchnic vasoconstriction**.

#### Clinical Manifestations
- **Bradycardia**
  - Sweating
  - Bilateral headache
  - Flushing
  - Nasal congestion
- **Splanchnic vasoconstriction**
  - Pallor
  - Piloerection
  - Cold extremities

### Note
- The unregulated sympathetic tone leads to sustained increasing blood pressure.
- Autonomic dysreflexia occurs with lesions at or above T6 because of the loss of sympathetic control of splanchnic circulation, resulting in a critical mass of blood vessels causing elevated blood pressure.

# Background
- Spinal cord injury above T6
- Frequency variable: 20-70% of patients
- **Above lesion:** reflex bradycardia & vasodilation (flushed)
- **Below lesion:** unopposed sympathetic stimulation (vasoconstriction/hypertension)  

### Common Clinical Manifestations
- Headache
- Diaphoresis
- Increased BP
- Bradycardia
- Flushing
- Piloerection
- Blurred vision
- Nasal obstruction
- Anxiety
- Nausea

### Consequences of Event
- Bradycardia
- AV block
- PACs
- PVCs
- Severe headache
- Seizures
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage
- Decreased level of consciousness
- Dyspnea
- LV failure
- Pulmonary edema
- Blurred vision
- Anxiety
- Agitation
- Chest pain/myocardial ischemia

# Considerations
- Potential for hypertensive emergency with end-organ damage
- Considerations of chronic SCI
- Need for invasive monitoring
- Difficult to assess success of neuraxial technique (see below)

# Management
- Discussion with surgeon regarding plan for procedure
- **Remove potential triggers**: full bladder, Foley insertion, full rectum, surgical stimulus
- General anesthetic vs neuraxial technique (if GA, consider a deep anesthetic)

## Management of Hypertensive Event
- Consider deepening level of anesthesia if under GA
- If epidural, consider top-up

### Treat Severe Hypertension with Fast-acting Titratable Agents
- Nitroprusside 0.5-3 mcg/kg/min or nitroglycerin 5-200 mcg/min
- Hydralazine 10-20 mg IV prn
- Phentolamine 5 mg IV prn
- Look for evidence of end-organ involvement & treat accordingly

# Pregnancy Considerations
- Multidisciplinary discussion regarding plan for labor & delivery
- Consider scheduled elective cesarean section

## If Vaginal Delivery
- Admit early to monitored bed with telemetry
- Need continuous BP monitoring with arterial line
- Remove all preventable triggers of autonomic hyperreflexia (vaginal exams, full bladder = Foley insertion)
- Start early epidural to prevent hypertensive episodes from contractions

### Difficult to Assess Success of Epidural
- May need larger test dose to rule out subarachnoid placement

### Two Ways to Assess Level of Epidural
1. Sensory block cephalad to level of spinal cord lesion
2. Evaluating segmental reflexes below level of the lesion: lightly stroke each side of the abdomen above & below the umbilicus, looking for contraction of the abdominal muscles & deviation of the umbilicus toward the stimulus (reflexes are absent below the level of the block)

## If Cesarean Delivery
- Either general anesthetic or neuraxial technique:
  - Must have arterial line
  - Vasodilators drawn up & ready
  - Succinylcholine contraindicated
  - Severe respiratory insufficiency or technical difficulties with neuraxial anesthesia may necessitate the use of general anesthesia
