# Measuring Intracranial Pressure
## Ventricular
- A catheter inserted into a lateral ventricle via a burr hole is the gold standard for measuring ICP.
- Also allows drainage of CSF as a treatment option.
- Risks: Haemorrhage at insertion and ventriculitis with prolonged use.
## Intraparenchymal
- Micro-miniature silicone strain gauge monitors can be inserted into the brain parenchyma to monitor ICP.
- Accurate and relatively easy to insert, even by non-neurosurgical staff.
- Commonest technique used to measure ICP

# Spinal Cord Monitoring (SCM)
- The risk of permanent damage after surgery to correct idiopathic scoliosis is about 1:1000 procedures.
- Most neurologic damage is due to ischaemia of the spinal cord caused by instrumental distraction, disruption of arterial blood supply and compression due to haematoma formation
- Patients with severe deformity, congenital scoliosis, kyphosis or preoperative abnormal neurology are at increased risk
- Any intraoperative compromise of spinal cord function needs to be detected as soon as possible and reversed immediately in order to improve neurological outcome
## Testing
### Clinical
- **Wake up test**
	- anaesthesia will be "lightened" and they will be asked to move their hands and then their feet.
	- They are reassured that they will feel no pain, will be re-anaesthetised immediately afterwards and will probably not recall the incident after surgery.
	- The test is performed once the instrumentation has been applied. Anaesthesia is lightened until the patient responds to commands.
	- The patient should not be awakened abruptly as bucking, coughing and sudden movement may result in tubes, lines and monitors being displaced.
	- Sudden deep inspiration by the patient increases the risk of venous air embolism
	- Surgery should only continue once the patient no longer responds to commands.
- **Ankle clonus test**
	- Elicited in normal people in a light plane of anaesthesia
	- During arousal this typically occurs before the patient is sufficiently responsive for the wake up test but it is a transient phenomenon which may be missed.
- These two techniques have the advantage of requiring no specialized personnel or equipment and will continue to be used where resources are limited
- They may also need to be used where electrophysiological monitoring techniques fail or yield equivocal results
- However they only provide evidence of cord function at the time of the test. Furthermore the wake up test demonstrates only motor function and may miss a sensory deficit. It cannot be done in the very young, the mentally handicapped or deaf patient.
### Neurophysiological or Evoked Potentials
- **Sensory evoked potentials (SEP)**
	- Cortical sensory evoked potentials (CSEP) are most commonly used because they mimic SEP obtained in the awake state; they are non-invasive and can be used throughout the procedure.
	- Stimuli are applied to surface electrodes and hence to peripheral nerves from which sensory fibres will pass through the surgical field. Typically the posterior tibial nerve at the ankle or the peroneal nerve at the fibular head (lower extremity) or the ulnar or median nerves at the wrist (upper extremity) are used for stimulation. Evoked potentials are then recorded from surface electrodes applied to the scalp over the relevant sensory cortex or they may be recorded at the level of the brainstem. At the brainstem level they are minimally affected by anaesthetic agents. They are however sensitive to changes in blood pressure and CO2 tension. Recordings from the cortex are more sensitive to anaesthetic agents particularly inhalational agents
	- The most widely used threshold for concern is a 50% reduction in amplitude compared with baseline preoperative records and a 10% increase in latency
	- Changes close to the threshold may be difficult and confirmation of normal function by means of a wake-up test may still be indicated
	- Spinal SEP are preferred in some institutions because although they require an invasive technique where recordings are made from an electrode inserted into the epidural space by the surgeon, they are more resistant to depressant effects of anaesthetics and physiological changes. Typically stimulation is applied percutaneously to the posterior tibial nerve at each knee and the evoked potentials are recorded from a bipolar electrode inserted into the epidural space in the high thoracic region
- **Motor evoked potentials**
	- Obtained by stimulating rostral to the site of surgery and recording the evoked signal distally. The stimulation is transcranial and the recording may be made from the spinal cord, from peripheral nerves or from a muscle in which a compound muscle action potential (CMAP) is generated. Responses recorded from the epidural space consist of a direct or D wave representing the direct activation of the corticospinal tract (CST) by the transcranial stimulus. In awake or lightly anaesthetised patients, the D wave is followed by a series of I (indirect) waves generated by cortical synapses. These descending cortical volleys then summate to excite anterior horn cells and spinal alpha motor neurons, thereby inducing a compound muscle action potential. The requirement for electrode placement, either percutaneously or by laminotomy, precludes routine use of this form of MEPs.
	- Neurogenic descending evoked potentials elicited from epidural electrospinal stimulation and recorded over lower extremity peripheral nerves were previously thought to be mediated within spinal motor tracts and because of their technical simplicity and minimal alteration by anaesthetic agents were popular for a period. It is now recognised that these potentials are mediated through spinal cord pathways that are in common with pathways responsible for SEPs. It is therefore a mixed or pure sensory response.
- **Electromyography**
	- SEPs are neither sensitive nor specific for identifying an injury to spinal nerve roots
	- Spontaneous electromyography (spEMG) can be used to monitor for injury or neural trauma to spinal nerve roots. During a surgical procedure, microtrauma to a spinal nerve root will provoke ion depolarization, and the resultant muscle or motor unit potential can be recorded from a muscle innervated by that specific nerve root.
	- Stimulus evoked electromyography (stEMG) is another EMG technique that can be used to monitor injury during pedicle screw placement. stEMG allows the detection of a pedicle wall violation during and after pedicle screw fixation. An electrical stimulus is applied to the pedicle screw and EMG activity is recorded from the muscles innervated by the nerve root adjacent to the pedicle. If the pedicle wall is fractured, the nerve root will depolarise at a much lower current mA) compared with a pedicle, causing muscle contraction that is recorded as an EMG response
## Practical Options
### EMG (electromyography)
- stimulating selective nerve roots it will trigger a responsecan alert surgeon they are near a nerve or if there is no response it can show damage has been done.
### MEPsmotor Evoked Potentials

Transcranial/ direct motor cortex stimulation = motor response 

Corticospinal tract stimulation

Posterior spinal artery

Pros:

	Faster than SSEPs

	Better at detecting damage to nerves.

Cons:

	Higher MEP thresholds in <6yrs old

	More sensitive to anaesthetic techniques

### SSEPSomatosensory Evoked Potentials

Stimulate peripheral nerves and monitor response on EEG.

Spinothalamic tract.

Anterior spinal artery

Pros:

	Better at detecting hypoperfusion of spinal cord

Cons:

	Average signal, provide less real time feed back, slower than MEPs

### Stagnara Wake up Test

Dangerous, times consuming, snapshot in time.

Largerly replaced by the above.

However sometimes used if the MEPs and SSEPs fail. So consent all patients for wake up test in case

## Effect of Anaesthetic Agents of Spinal Cord Monitoring
- Volatiles cause a dose dependent increase in latency and decrease in amplitude of somatosensory evoked potentials. The most potent in this regard is isoflurane, followed by enflurane and halothane. Sevoflurane and desflurane are said to have a similar effect to isoflurane. At therapeutic concentrations the halogenated agents abolish TceMEPs.
- Anaesthetic vapour concentrations more than 0.5 MAC are generally not compatible with reliable monitoring
- Neuromuscular blockers have little effect on SEPs, but profound block precludes the recording of CMAPs.
- In practice it is prudent to employ a TIVA technique using an opiate infusion together with a propofol infusion.
- sufentanil is a very useful agent. There is some controversy about the role of remifentanil in postoperative hyperalgesia and until more is known about this phenomenon, remifentanil should probably not be used as the main intraoperative opiate during corrective spinal surgery.
### Effects of Anesthetics on SSEPs and TcMEPs

|**Agent**|**SSEPs**|**TcMEPs**|
|---|---|---|
|**Opiates**|Mild ↓|Mild ↓|
|**Barbiturates**|Variable|Profound|
|**Midazolam**|Mild|Marked|
|**Ketamine**|Enhanced|Enhanced|
|**Etomidate**|Enhanced|↓ amplitude|
|**Propofol**|Mild ↓|Mild ↓|

**Key:**

- **SSEPs:** Somatosensory Evoked Potentials
- **TcMEPs:** Transcranial Motor Evoked Potentials
- **↓:** Decrease in signal

**Summary:**

- **Opiates** result in a mild decrease in both SSEPs and TcMEPs.
- **Barbiturates** have variable effects on SSEPs and cause a profound decrease in TcMEPs.
- **Midazolam** mildly affects SSEPs but causes a marked decrease in TcMEPs.
- **Ketamine** enhances both SSEPs and TcMEPs.
- **Etomidate** enhances SSEPs but decreases the amplitude of TcMEPs.
- **Propofol** results in a mild decrease in both SSEPs and TcMEPs.
## Non-anaesthetic Intraoperative Influences on Evoked Potential Monitoring
- **Spinal cord blood flow.**
	- Mean arterial pressure below the autoregulatory threshold will decrease SSEP amplitude
- **Haematocrit level.**
	- Levels below 15% will decrease amplitude and increase latency
- **PaCO2**
	- A tension less than 20 mmHg will also decrease amplitude and increase latency.
- **Temperature**
	- Moderate hypothermia will decrease amplitude, increase conduction time and latency, and increase stimulation threshold
