## Key Measures to Prevent Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP)

1. **Avoid Increasing Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF)**
   - Avoid hypercapnia, hypoxia, hypertension, and hyperthermia.

2. **Use Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV)**
   - Control PaCO₂, ensure good oxygenation, and maintain adequate analgesia and anaesthetic depth.

3. **Avoid Increasing Venous Pressure**
   - Prevent coughing and straining.
   - Avoid head-down position.
   - Avoid obstructing neck veins with endotracheal tube ties.

4. **Prevent Further Cerebral Oedema**
   - Avoid fluid overload; restrict IV fluids to 30 mL/kg/day if cerebral oedema is present.
   - Do not use hypotonic solutions.
   - Maintain high normal plasma osmolality.

5. **Maintain Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)**
   - Keep CPP > 60 mmHg.
   - Avoid anaesthetic agents that increase ICP.

## Specific Measures to Decrease ICP

- **Pharmacological Interventions:**
  - **Mannitol:** 0.25–1 g/kg over 15 minutes.
  - **5% Saline:** 100 mL.
  - **Furosemide:** 0.25–1 mg/kg.
  - Insert a urinary catheter in patients receiving diuretics.
  - **Corticosteroids:** Reduce oedema surrounding tumours and abscesses (Dexamethasone 4 mg 6-hourly).
- **Ventilation Adjustments:**
  - Modest hyperventilation to PaCO₂ of 4.0–4.5 kPa (30–34 mmHg). Note: EtCO₂ is lower than PaCO₂.
- **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Drainage:**
  - CSF may be drained via a ventricular or lumbar drain.
- **Positioning:**
  - Position the patient with a head-up tilt of 30° to reduce central venous pressure (CVP).

### Prevention of Seizures

- **Phenytoin:** Prophylactic or therapeutic use (loading dose of 15 mg/kg, followed by a single daily dose of 3–4 mg/kg).

## Monitoring

- **Invasive Monitoring:**
  - Arterial line, central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring, neuromuscular monitoring, core temperature monitoring.
  - Insert a urinary catheter.

## Anaesthetic Technique

- **Induction:**
  - **Propofol:** 2–3 mg/kg.
  - **Remifentanil:** 0.2–0.5 micrograms/kg/min.
  - If remifentanil is unavailable, use fentanyl 5 micrograms/kg at induction or an alfentanil infusion (25–50 micrograms/kg/hr).
- **Adjuncts:**
  - **Lidocaine:** 1.5 mg/kg or a β-blocker (labetalol 5 mg increments) to blunt response.
  - Use a non-depolarizing relaxant to facilitate intubation.
- **Airway Management:**
  - Use an armoured endotracheal tube (ETT) to prevent kinking; secure in place with tapes.
- **Intraoperative Maintenance:**
  - **Anaesthesia Maintenance:**
	- Volatile agent (sevoflurane/isoflurane <1 MAC) or target-controlled infusion (TCI) propofol (3–6 micrograms/mL).
	- Continue remifentanil infusion at a lower rate (0.15–0.25 micrograms/kg/min).
- **Surgical Positioning:**
  - Avoid extreme neck flexion or rotation.
  - Support the shoulder if the head is turned for surgery.
- **Hypertensive Response to Mayfield Fixator:**
  - Infiltrate pin sites with local anaesthetic.
  - Administer additional remifentanil (0.5–1 micrograms/kg) or propofol (0.5–1 mg/kg) if necessary.
- **Closure Stage:**
  - Administer IV morphine during dura, bone flap, and scalp closure.

# Prevention of Perioperative Neurological Injury

1. **Identify High-Risk Patients and Optimize Them**
2. **Intraoperative Cerebral Protection Strategies**

   - **Non-Pharmacological:**
	 - Hypothermia.
	 - Maintenance of CPP.
	 - Blood glucose control (aim 6-12 mmol/dL).
	 - Maintain haemoglobin concentration (transfusion trigger may be as high as 9 g/dL).
	 - Maintain normal arterial CO₂ tension.
	 - Optimize brain tissue oxygen tension.
	 - Reduce embolic load (see cardiac neuroprotection section).
   - **Pharmacological:**
	 - **Osmotherapy:** Mannitol.
	 - **Ischaemic Preconditioning/Post-Conditioning:** No definitive evidence for particular drugs.
	 - **Volatile Anaesthetics:** Generally accepted as reducing ischaemic cerebral injury based on experimental models, though clinical data in humans are lacking.

## Hypothermia in Neurosurgery

- **IHAST Trial:**
  - 1001 patients undergoing craniotomy for SAH.
  - Mild hypothermia (33°C) showed no improvement in neurological outcome or survival.

## Neuroprotection in Cardiac Surgery

- **Reduce Embolic Load:**
  - Epiaortic ultrasound to visualize atheromatous plaques.
  - Use pericardial suction aspirate with inline arterial filtering.
  - CO₂ insufflation of mediastinum (heavier and more soluble than air, shorter life span for emboli).
- **Optimize Brain Tissue Oxygen Tension:**
  - Use pulsatile flow during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
- **Avoid CPB During Cardiac Surgery:**
  - Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) reduces stroke in high-risk populations, though the difference was not statistically significant.
- **Maintain CPP:**
  - Traditionally, a minimum mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50 mmHg.
  - Studies suggest a higher MAP (>70 mmHg) is associated with lower stroke and myocardial infarction outcomes in high-risk individuals.
- **Haemoglobin:**
  - Transfusion trigger of 7 g/dL.
- **Hypothermia:**
  - Limited evidence for hypothermia; possible issues during rewarming or inadvertent hyperthermia.
- **Glucose Control:**
  - Maintain within normal ranges.
- **Acid-Base Management:**
  - Alpha-stat method reduces embolic load.

- **Reverse Anticoagulation**: Follow specific protocols for patients on anticoagulants, using PCC, Vitamin K, or specific antidotes as necessary.
# Cerebral Oximetry

![](Pasted%20image%2020240712110642.png)

## Overview

Cerebral oximetry is a non-invasive, continuous monitoring technique used to measure cerebral oxygenation. Utilizing near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), it provides estimates of cerebral haemoglobin oxygen saturation. This method leverages principles similar to pulse oximetry, particularly the Beer-Lambert Law, and requires baseline values to be obtained before anesthesia induction.

## Physics of Cerebral Oximetry

Cerebral oximeters consist of a monitor connected to probes attached to the scalp. These probes emit infrared light, which penetrates the skull and interacts with cerebral tissue. The light is either absorbed, scattered, or reflected, with the reflected light detected by the probes. The Beer-Lambert Law underpins the measurement process, combining Beer’s Law (light absorption increases with substance concentration) and Lambert’s Law (light absorption increases with travel distance through the substance).

## Calculation and Interpretation

Cerebral oxygenation is calculated based on the absorption spectra of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin. The spatial resolution technique is employed to minimize extracranial blood contamination by using multiple probes and spatially resolving the depth of tissue investigated. Mathematical algorithms further refine the measurement to ensure it reflects cerebral rather than extracranial oxygenation.

## Clinical Interpretation

Normal baseline cerebral oximetry values range from 60% to 80%, though lower values may be normal in some cardiac patients. Factors affecting cerebral oxygenation include cardiac output, haemoglobin concentration, pulmonary function, arterial inflow/venous outflow obstruction, and inspired oxygen concentration. Changes in cerebral oximetry should be considered alongside clinical information and patient physiology.

## Limitations

- Potential contamination from extracranial blood sources.
- Interference from electrosurgical equipment.
- Regional rather than comprehensive brain oxygenation measurement.
- Inability to diagnose specific causes of desaturation.

## Clinical Applications

### Cardiac Surgery

Cerebral oximetry has been shown to reduce adverse neurological events in cardiac surgery. Studies, such as those involving coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), indicate an association between cerebral desaturation and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, though the evidence on the effectiveness of intervention protocols varies. Cerebral oximetry is particularly useful during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, despite limitations in sensitivity at low temperatures.

### Vascular Surgery

During carotid endarterectomy, cerebral oximetry helps detect cerebral ischaemia, guiding interventions such as shunt placement. It can also predict postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome, aiding in the management of patients with impaired cerebral autoregulation.

### Paediatrics

In neonates, cerebral oximetry can provide early detection of conditions like periventricular leukomalacia and intraventricular hemorrhage, which are typically diagnosed late with significant neurological consequences.

## Additional Uses

Cerebral oximetry is being explored for monitoring perfusion in hepatic, renal, and splanchnic tissues and as a screening tool for blood transfusion needs in trauma patients.
