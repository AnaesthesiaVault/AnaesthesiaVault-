# Types of Tumors

## Primary Tumors
- **Astrocytoma**: Multiple types with varying degrees of prognosis.
- **Oligodendroglioma**
- **Ependymoma**: Occurs in children and young adults, commonly located in the floor of the 4th ventricle.
- **Neuroectodermal Tumors**:
  - Retinoblastoma
  - Neuroblastoma
  - Pineoblastoma
  - Medulloblastoma: Most common paediatric primary brain tumor.
- **Meningioma**: Mostly benign.
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **Acoustic Neuroma**: Benign schwannoma of the 8th cranial nerve, bilateral in neurofibromatosis type 2.
- **CNS Lymphoma**

## Secondary Metastases
- Common primary sources: Breast, lung, colon, and melanoma.
- Tend to bleed more.

# Conduct of Anaesthesia

## Identifying Presence/Absence of Raised ICP
- Symptoms: Nausea and vomiting, reduced level of consciousness, mydriasis, reduced pupil reactivity, bradycardia, hyperthermia, breathing disturbances.

## Sedation/Premedication
- Use with caution: Increased sensitivity may lead to hypoventilation, raising pCO₂ and ICP. Sedation can also mask a reduced level of consciousness due to raised ICP.

## Haemodynamics
- Maintain stability:
  - Blunt the intubation response.
  - Avoid hypotension.
  - Maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) between 50-70 mmHg.

## Maintenance
- Consider effects of anaesthesia on neuromonitoring (consider using TIVA).

## Drugs
- Neuromuscular Blocking Agents (NMBA): Check if nerve stimulation is necessary.

## Glucose Management
- Aim for normoglycaemia: Hyperglycaemia can exacerbate neuronal injury and worsen outcomes.

## Positioning
- Dependent on tumor location (refer to guidelines for sitting position).

## Intravenous Access
- Use large bore cannula due to potential for bleeding.

## Blood Products
- Have blood products available if recommended by surgeons.

## Monitoring
- Arterial line (A-line) and central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring as needed.
- Capnography: Watch for air embolism in sitting position.
- ECG: Monitor for changes indicating raised ICP or brainstem/cranial nerve traction or manipulation.
- Nerve stimulator: Avoid using on limbs with paresis or paralysis due to resistance to NMBA.

## Emergence
- Aim for rapid emergence to enable neurological assessment.
- Note: Differential awakening—subtle neurological deficits present preoperatively can be exacerbated by sedation and may resolve as the patient fully wakes up.
