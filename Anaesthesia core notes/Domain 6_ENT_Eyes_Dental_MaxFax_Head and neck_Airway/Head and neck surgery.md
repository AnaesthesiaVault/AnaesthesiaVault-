# Head and Neck Surgery

## Background

- Includes cancer of the:
  - Upper aerodigestive tract
  - Paranasal sinuses
  - Thyroid and salivary glands
- Patients presenting with head and neck cancer have a 10% risk of having a synchronous primary elsewhere within the aerodigestive tract.
- Risk factors:
  - Smoking
  - Alcohol
  - Chewing tobacco
  - Poor oral hygiene
  - Exposure to wood
- Incidence of head and neck cancers has increased in the past decade due to the emergence of HPV transmission linked to orogenital sex.

## Preoperative Assessment

### Aim

- Identify patients with potentially difficult airways
- Stratify the risks
- Treat comorbidities
- Optimize physiology

### Airway Assessment

- Higher incidence of difficult airways in head and neck cancer compared to the general population.
  - Assessment of difficulty in intubation
  - Feasibility of appropriate rescue plans for achieving oxygenation
  - Subtle changes in voice, dysphagia, orthopnoea, and recent onset of snoring may indicate airway compromise. In slowly progressive cancer, patients may have few signs or symptoms despite significant airway narrowing.
  - Radiotherapy can result in a ‘fibrotic airway’ with woody, non-compliant tissue, making face mask ventilation and laryngoscopy difficult.
- Radiological imaging (CT or MRI) determines the extent of cancer and potential obstruction.
- Ultrasonography is useful in identifying the cricothyroid membrane before induction of anesthesia.
- Awake nasal endoscopy can be performed before induction of anesthesia, especially useful when no other radiological investigations are available.

### Co-morbidity

- Common co-morbidities in head and neck cancer patients:
  - Cardiorespiratory disease
  - Poor nutritional states linked with smoking and excessive alcohol consumption
- Perioperative risk increases with age and the number of co-morbidities.

### Baseline Investigations

- Full blood count
- Clotting screen
- Biochemical profile with urea and electrolytes
- Liver function tests
- Blood sugar
- Electrocardiography (ECG)

### Further Investigations Based on Risk Factors and Presenting Symptoms

- Chest X-ray (CXR)
- Pulmonary function tests
- Arterial blood gases
- Echocardiogram

### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

- Common in head and neck cancer patients:
  - Optimize the reversible element before surgery by modifying bronchodilator therapy, treating acute infection, and trialing steroids.
  - Flow volume loops from pulmonary function testing can differentiate dyspnoea from upper airway obstruction and chronic airway disease. In COPD, the expiratory limb has a single plateau, while fixed upper airway obstruction shows plateaus in both inspiratory and expiratory limbs.
- Spirometry data depend on patient cooperation and a well-trained respiratory technician.

### Cardiopulmonary Function

- Calculation of metabolic equivalent based on self-reported functional capacity is subjective and cannot identify high-risk patients alone.
  - Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides a dynamic measure of cardiorespiratory function.
  - Patients with an anaerobic threshold of less than 11 ml/min/kg are at higher risk of cardiac complications.
- Poorly controlled heart failure (New York Heart Association Grade III–IV) has significant prognostic implications.
  - Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proBNP are useful in screening for heart failure and are predictive of 30-day cardiac mortality.
  - Right heart failure associated with pulmonary hypertension carries significant risk.

### Nutrition

- Preoperative malnutrition correlates with:
  - Poor wound healing
  - Infection
  - Increased risk of postoperative complications
- Causes of malnutrition:
  - Poor dietary habits (e.g., alcoholism)
  - Dysphagia
  - Cancer cachexia
  - Systemic effects of chemotherapy
  - Radiation mucositis
- Nutritional therapy is indicated if:
  - BMI is less than 18.5
  - Weight loss is greater than 10% of body weight
  - Inadequate food intake is likely after surgery
- Nutritional support varies from oral supplements to percutaneous gastrostomy, depending on the extent of the tumor, planned surgical procedure, and social support.
- Incidence of refeeding syndrome is high in head and neck cancer patients due to hormonal and metabolic changes.

## Management of Refeeding Syndrome

1. **Check serum potassium, calcium, phosphate, and magnesium levels.**
2. **Administer supplements before feeding starts:**
	- Thiamine orally
	- Vitamin B (oral or intravenous)
	- Trace elements
3. **Rehydrate and supplement serum levels as required:**
	- Potassium: 2-4 mmol/kg/day
	- Phosphate: 0.3-0.6 mmol/kg/day
	- Calcium and magnesium: 0.2 mmol/kg/day i.v. or 0.4 mmol/kg/day orally
4. **Start feeding:**
	- 0.0418 MJ/kg/day
5. **Slowly increase feeding over 4-7 days.**
6. **Monitor serum levels for the first 2 weeks and replace as necessary:**
	- Potassium
	- Phosphate
	- Calcium
	- Magnesium
## Anaesthetic Management

### Airway Management

- **Preoperative Evaluation:**
  - Assess if face mask ventilation is likely following induction of general anaesthesia.
  - Determine if laryngoscopy and intubation are likely to be difficult.
  - Consider if an awake technique is more appropriate.
  - Evaluate the feasibility of emergency surgical airway and front of neck access (FONA).

### Sequelae of Head and Neck Cancer Treatment

#### Radiotherapy
- Limited neck extension
- Temporomandibular joint ankylosis
- Osteoradionecrosis of mandible
- Hypothyroidism
- Baroreceptor damage
- Carotid artery stenosis
- Poor wound healing

#### Maxillectomy and Craniofacial Resection
- Difficult mask seal
- Nasal access difficult
- Temporalis contracture
- Temporomandibular joint pseudoankylosis

#### Tongue and Floor of Mouth Surgery
- Trismus
- Fixed immobile tongue
- Limited mandibular space
- Increased tongue cavity ratio with flap reconstruction

#### Laryngeal Surgery
- Laryngeal stenosis
- Impaired swallowing
- Aspiration risk

#### Neck Dissection
- Damage to IX, X, XII nerves
- Impaired swallowing
- Aspiration risk
- Vocal cord palsy
- **Airway Management Strategy:**
  - Determine if intubation is possible after induction or safer with an awake technique.
  - Awake intubation should be considered if difficulty in tracheal intubation and bag-mask ventilation is predicted or experienced.
  - Advantages of awake approach: maintenance of airway patency, gas exchange, protection against aspiration.
  - General anaesthesia can worsen airway obstruction.
  - Awake tracheostomy under local anaesthesia should be considered in significant obstruction cases.
  - Inhalation induction frequently fails in head and neck pathology, thus rescue plans must be in place.
  - Direct laryngoscopy should be performed under optimum conditions.
  - If direct laryngoscopy fails, initiate the predetermined backup plan to avoid complete airway obstruction.
  - Limited evidence supports the use of video laryngoscopes in head and neck cancers.
  - Rescue oxygenation techniques should be discussed with the theatre team:
	- Face mask ventilation
	- Supraglottic ventilation
	- Surgical airway
  - Trans-nasal high-flow rapid insufflation ventilatory exchange (THRIVE) is useful for maintaining oxygen saturation.

### Planning for Postoperative Airway

- Surgical tracheostomy is essential when postoperative swelling and oedema can lead to airway compromise.
- Decision for tracheostomy based on:
  - Extent of surgery
  - Likelihood of postoperative swelling
  - Ability to rescue the airway
  - Preceding difficult intubation
  - Preoperative respiratory reserve
- Advantages of tracheostomy:
  - Secure airway
  - Effective bronchial toilet
  - Reduction in dead space assists in weaning from mechanical ventilation
- Risks of tracheostomy:
  - Haemorrhage
  - Obstruction
  - Displacement
  - Stomal recurrence
  - Poor healing after radiotherapy
- Not necessary after every major cancer resection; postoperative ventilation with an endotracheal tube is an option in selected cases.

### Practical Anaesthetic Management

- **Position:**
  - Supine with 15–20 degree head-up tilt to improve venous drainage.
- **Access:**
  - Long ventilator tubing and vascular access lines required.
- **Protection:**
  - Eyes should be protected by tapes, eye shields, or moistened eye pads.
  - Pressure points must be padded.
  - Compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic calf compression.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Standard monitoring; use of invasive techniques determined by patient’s comorbidities and surgery nature.
  - Central venous lines useful for longer-term perioperative IV access and fluid therapy response.
  - Femoral vein catheters or peripherally placed central catheters preferred if surgical access to neck and chest needed.
- **Fluid Therapy:**
  - Goal-directed fluid therapy based on cardiac output monitoring.
  - Cardiac output monitoring (LiDCOVR or FloTracVR) preferred.
- **Temperature Measurement:**
  - Essential to avoid overheating.
  - Peripheral or rectal temperature measurement preferred.
  - Bladder temperature measurement ideal using urinary catheters with temperature sensors.
  - In free flap transfer, both skin and core bladder temperatures measured to ensure core–periphery gradient <1.5°C.

### Maintenance and Postoperative Analgesia

- **Maintenance:**
  - Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) or inhalation anaesthetic with remifentanil.
  - Remifentanil enables rapid titration and blunting of haemodynamic response.
  - Moderate hypotension may reduce bleeding and improve operative field.
  - Avoid induced hypotension in patients with autonomic neuropathy, chronic hypertension, or susceptibility to ischaemia.
- **Postoperative Analgesia:**
  - Longer-acting opiates, e.g., morphine 0.15 mg/kg given incrementally towards the end of surgery.
  - Dexamethasone often given to reduce airway oedema.
  - PONV prophylaxis: ondansetron or cyclizine.

### Specific Anaesthetic Considerations

#### Oral and Maxillofacial Cancers

- Oral intubation facilitates access to maxilla, nose, and paranasal sinuses lesions.
- Nasal tracheal intubation often preferred for oral cancers.
- Submental intubation is contraindicated due to risk of orocutaneous fistula.
- Craniofacial resection for skull base cancer:
  - Ensure adequate cerebral perfusion pressure and oxygen delivery.
  - Maintain normocapnia and normotension.
  - Broad-spectrum antibiotic cover recommended.

#### Free Flap Transfer

- Aim to maintain a hyperdynamic circulation with increased cardiac output and normothermia.
- Haematocrit maintained at 30–35%.
- Avoid norepinephrine; prefer dobutamine.
- Handle flap exposure and increase mean arterial pressure with epinephrine infusion.
- Absolute contraindications: sickle cell disease, untreated polycythaemia rubra vera.
- Specialist referral and treatment for patients with active vasculitis.
- Magnetic resonance angiography for peripheral vascular disease to determine donor vessel patency.

#### Salivary Gland Cancer

- Preserve facial nerve; use nerve monitoring.
- Discuss neuromuscular blocking agents with the surgeon.
- Neuromuscular blockers can be administered to facilitate intubation, with remifentanil to avoid further doses.

#### Thyroid Cancer

- Focus on thyroid function and airway management.
- Optimize euthyroid status for thyroxine-secreting tumours.
- Standard IV induction and neuromuscular block if airway not compromised.
- FONA may not be possible with large thyroid lesions.
- Retrostenal goitre management remains controversial; include rigid bronchoscopy in backup plan.
- Use neural integrity monitor tubes to identify recurrent laryngeal nerve.
- Recognize complications like hypocalcaemia and tracheomalacia.

#### Patients with High Alcohol Dependency

- Consider active inpatient withdrawal treatment for at least 48 hours.
- Optimize nutritional, electrolyte, and haematological indices before surgery.

### Panendoscopy

- **Ideal Technique:**
  - Provides a clear, unobstructed view
  - Protects from aspiration
  - Depends on the site of the lesion, surgical preference, and available equipment
- **Spontaneous Ventilation:**
  - Rarely used in adults
  - Deep plane of anesthesia required to maintain vocal cord relaxation without neuromuscular paralysis, often resulting in apnea and cardiovascular instability
  - High-flow oxygen therapy (THRIVE) useful for ‘apnoeic’ oxygenation during endoscopic procedures

### Advantages and Limitations of Ventilation Techniques for Panendoscopy

#### Microlaryngoscopy Tube and IPPV
- **Advantages:**
  - Airway protection with cuffed tube
  - No specialist equipment needed for jet ventilation
  - Unobstructed view of anterior two-thirds of the larynx
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Limited access to the posterior commissure
  - Risk of airway fire with laser use
  - High airway resistance due to small diameter of the tracheal tube

#### Supraglottic Jet Ventilation
- **Advantages:**
  - Optimal surgical access for posterior commissure lesions
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Risk of gastric distension with entrained air
  - Poor ventilation if suspension laryngoscope or jetting needle misaligned
  - No airway protection
  - Inability to monitor end-tidal CO2 concentration
  - Vocal cord flutter with ventilation
  - Barotrauma and aspiration risk
  - Potential for tumor seeding
  - Requires TIVA technique

#### Subglottic Jet Ventilation
- **Advantages:**
  - Minimal vocal cord movement
  - More efficient than supraglottic ventilation
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Requires TIVA technique
  - Greater risk of barotrauma compared to supraglottic ventilation

#### Trans-Tracheal Ventilation
- **Advantages:**
  - Useful in managing difficult airway
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Risk of barotrauma
  - Potential for tumor seeding
  - Issues with trans-tracheal catheter: kinking, blocking, dislodgement
  - Requires TIVA technique
  - No airway protection

### Anaesthetic Options for Panendoscopy

- **Microlaryngoscopy ETT & IPPV:**
  - **Pros:**
	- Unobstructed view of anterior 2/3 of larynx
	- Airway protection
  - **Cons:**
	- Limited access to posterior commissure
	- Risk of airway fire with laser
	- High airway resistance with small diameter ETT
- **Supraglottic Jet Ventilation:**
  - **Pros:**
	- Optimal access for posterior commissure lesions
  - **Cons:**
	- Risk of gastric distension
	- Poor ventilation if jet needle misaligned
	- Unable to measure CO2
	- No airway protection
	- Vocal cord flutter with ventilation
	- Barotrauma risk
	- Potential for tumor seeding
	- Requires TIVA
- **Subglottic Jet Ventilation:**
  - **Pros:**
	- More efficient than supraglottic
	- Less vocal cord movement
  - **Cons:**
	- Requires TIVA
	- Greater barotrauma risk than supraglottic
- **Transtracheal Ventilation (Jet Ventilation Catheter):**
  - **Pros:**
	- Can be used for managing a difficult airway
  - **Cons:**
	- Barotrauma
	- Tumor seeding
	- Catheter kinking, blocking, dislodgement
	- Requires TIVA
	- No airway protection
- **High Flow Oxygen Delivery (Apnoeic or Spontaneously Ventilating):**
  - **Cons:**
	- CO2 build-up with apnoeic ventilation

### Laryngectomy

- **Extubation:**
  - Systematic approach with upright positioning, full reversal of neuromuscular blocking drugs, and preoxygenation
  - Difficult Airway Society (DAS) extubation guidelines serve as a framework to identify ‘low-risk’ or ‘at-risk’ extubation
  - For ‘at-risk’ patients, a planned tracheostomy or delayed extubation is safer
  - Low-dose remifentanil infusion assists with smooth emergence, obtunds cardiovascular reflexes, and reduces agitation and coughing
  - Extubation over an airway exchange catheter (AEC) suitable for carefully selected patients; ensures distal tip is in mid-trachea

### Postoperative Care

- **Pain Management:**
  - Combination of regular paracetamol and opiates (subcutaneous or oral)
  - Patient-controlled analgesia for extensive resection
  - Higher analgesic requirement for flap donor areas (e.g., ischium)
  - Local anaesthetic infusions with wound catheters reduce opioid requirements
- **Tracheostomy Care:**
  - Humidified oxygen or nebulized 4% lignocaine with opiates to alleviate symptoms
  - Enhanced recovery protocols improve patient satisfaction and reduce length of stay
  - Specialized care in wards or critical care units trained in tracheostomy care
- **PONV Reduction:**
  - Regular antiemetics
  - Liberal fluid regime
  - Early establishment of oral intake
- **Postoperative Management:**
  - Intravenous steroids for 48–72 hours to reduce oedema
  - Low-molecular-weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis
  - Goals: normotension, normothermia, adequate filling, regular flap monitoring, haematocrit maintained at 30–35%
  - Early postoperative nutrition
- **Swallowing Assessment:**
  - For total pharyngolaryngectomy and oesophageal reconstruction with jejunal conduit, clinical and video fluoroscopy (modified barium swallow) at Day 5
  - Oral intake started under specialist dietician supervision
- **Respiratory Distress:**
  - Head elevation, nebulized epinephrine, high-flow nasal oxygen as temporizing measures
  - Careful nasal endoscopy to determine if fibreoptic intubation is feasible
  - ‘Double airway intervention set-up’ with personnel and equipment for emergency surgical airway is essential
  - Management of displaced tracheostomy tube follows national tracheostomy project guidelines based on whether the ‘native’ upper airway is patent
# Trachea and Bronchi Surgery

## Pathophysiology of Tracheobronchial Obstruction

### Classification of Airway Obstruction

- **Extra-thoracic or intra-thoracic**
  - Determined by level in relation to vocal cords
- **Fixed or variable**
  - Determined by how airflow relates to the respiratory cycle

### Variable Extra-thoracic Obstruction

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Acute inspiratory stridor
  - Elevated work of breathing
- **Common Sites**:
  - Nose
  - Pharynx
  - Larynx

### Variable Intra-thoracic Obstruction

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Expiratory stridor, often difficult to diagnose
- **Causes**:
  - Tracheal pathology
  - Bronchial pathology
  - Lung pathology
- **Common Causes**:
  - Benign or malignant neoplasms
  - Inhaled foreign body
  - Infection and inflammation
- **Complications in Anaesthetized and Paralysed Patients**:
  - Positive pressure ventilation may lead to progressive hyperinflation and barotrauma or volutrauma

### Fixed Large Airway Obstruction

- **Common Causes**:
  - Post-intubation stenosis
  - Goitre
  - Endotracheal neoplasms
  - Bronchial stenosis
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Reduction in airflow throughout the respiratory cycle
- **Etiology**:
  - Post-intubation and post-tracheostomy trauma are leading causes of tracheal stenosis
  - Despite the use of modern high-volume low-pressure cuffs, prolonged intubation survival rates have increased

### Clinical Presentation of Fixed Intra-thoracic Obstruction

- **Symptoms**:
  - Slowly progressive dyspnoea
  - Cough
  - Wheeze
  - Recurrent pneumonia
- **Timing**:
  - Often present weeks or months following intubation or tracheostomy

## Clinical Assessment

![](Pasted%20image%2020240408154056.png)

### Indications for Surgery on the Trachea and Main Bronchi

#### Clinical Features Pertinent to the Assessment of the Thoracic Surgical Patient

**Neoplastic Disease**:
- Lambert-Eaton syndrome
- Para-neoplastic endocrine lesions: Cushing’s syndrome, SIADH, hypercalcaemia, hypoglycaemia, acromegaly, hyperthyroidism, carcinoid syndrome
- Post-chemotherapy: Venous access, immunosuppression
- Post-radiotherapy: Airway soft tissue fibrosis
- Superior vena cava obstruction syndrome: Facial swelling, venous distension, upper limb oedema, Pemberton’s sign
- Metastatic disease: Confusion, seizures, pathological fractures, liver disease, malnutrition, cachexia
- Psychiatric comorbidity: Depression, anxiety

**Non-neoplastic Disease**:
- Post-tracheal intubation or tracheostomy: Course and events of previous anaesthetic and ICU stay, rehabilitation, medical optimization
- Inhaled foreign body: Potential for airway burns or erosion
- Inflammatory causes: Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, polychondritis
- Infective causes: Tuberculosis, diphtheria
- Vocal cord dysfunction: Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, idiopathic progressive subglottic stenosis

**History and Examination**:
- Dictated by primary pathology
- General enquiry of dyspnoea, wheeze, stridor, and functional limitation

### Diagnostic Modalities

- **Imaging**:
  - CT and MRI can demonstrate tracheal and bronchial narrowing but may not accurately determine the exact size, length, and position of the obstruction
- **Flow-volume Loops**:
  - Limited diagnostic use but may help identify whether the obstruction is fixed or variable
- **Bronchoscopy**:
  - Most useful in evaluating intra-thoracic tracheobronchial obstruction
  - Awake flexible bronchoscopy can precipitate complete central airway obstruction; therefore, it should be performed under general anaesthesia

## Anaesthesia and Tracheobronchial Obstruction

- General principles of shared airway, teamwork, and clear planning are imperative

### Comparison of Strategies for Management of Extraand Intra-Thoracic Tracheobronchial Obstruction

**Extra-thoracic Obstruction**:
- Difficult mask ventilation
- Difficult intubation
- Awake Fibreoptic Intubation (AFOI) useful
- 'Front of neck' rescue procedure
- High risk of gastric insufflation

**Intra-thoracic Obstruction**:
- Easy mask ventilation
- Easy intubation
- AFOI of limited use
- Rigid bronchoscopy rescue procedure
- High risk of barotrauma and volutrauma

### Airway Strategies for Anaesthetic Management

- **Variable Obstruction**:
  - Distal gas trapping with positive pressure ventilation can occur due to loss of muscle tone
  - Strategies include removing PEEP, limiting PMAX, and increasing expiratory time
- **Central Airway Obstruction**:
  - Must be anticipated from induction to full emergence
  - Rigid rescue bronchoscope should always be on hand
  - Traditional airway rescue methods like cricothyroid puncture are of limited use
  - Heliox may be useful in near-complete obstruction; 100% oxygen should be used in complete obstruction
  - Steroids, nebulized adrenaline, and diuretics may reduce mucosal oedema and lessen obstruction

## Anaesthesia for Bronchoscopy

- **Choice of Bronchoscopy**:
  - Usually a function of surgical preference
  - Flexible bronchoscopy in tracheobronchial stenosis risks central airway obstruction and is rarely performed under sedation or local anaesthesia
  - Induction of anaesthesia followed by insertion of ETT or LMA through which the scope can be advanced
  - Most practitioners prefer intravenous induction with positive pressure ventilation over inhalation induction with spontaneous ventilation
  - Anaesthesia maintained with volatile agents and titrated FiO2
- **Rigid Bronchoscopy**:
  - Profound surgical stimulation; requires opiates and neuromuscular blockade
  - Anaesthesia typically maintained with propofol and remifentanil (TCI or intermittent boluses)
  - Short-acting muscle relaxants like suxamethonium or atracurium; rocuronium is acceptable due to sugammadex availability
  - Low-frequency jet ventilation commonly employed with a Sanders-injector or equivalent

### Spontaneous vs. Paralysis & Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV)

**Spontaneous Ventilation**:
- Less likely to dislodge foreign body distally
- Less air trapping
- Better oxygenation as oxygen is entrained around bronchoscope

**Paralysis & PPV**:
- Less coughing
- Less atelectasis
- Overcomes resistance of bronchoscope

### Maintenance of Anaesthesia

- **TIVA**:
  - Less environmental pollution
  - More predictable and controlled anaesthetic depth
  - Propofol and remifentanil are commonly used due to familiarity; propofol and dexmedetomidine may be more cardiovascularly stable and better at maintaining spontaneous ventilation
  - Consider bolus of propofol as foreign body is pulled through cords

## Anaesthesia for Laser Therapy

- **Indications and Outcomes**:
  - Laser therapy of tracheal lesions is typically a temporary or palliative measure.
  - A carbon dioxide laser can be used to de-bulk non-resectable airway tumours causing central airway obstruction.
- **Precautions**:
  - Use of air fresh-gas
  - Use of laser-resistant tubes
  - Saline-filled cuffs
  - Intravenous maintenance of anaesthesia

## Anaesthesia for Inhaled Foreign Body

- **Patient Demographics**:
  - Commonly performed in children.
- **Procedure**:
  - Rigid bronchoscopy typically undertaken with general anaesthesia.
- **Clinical Presentation**:
  - Respiratory compromise severity can vary.
  - Patients are often observed until fasted.
  - Distal collapse or consolidation may occur due to a ball-valve effect of the foreign body.
  - Dynamic hyperinflation distal to the obstruction may occur due to gas trapping.
- **Anaesthetic Approach**:
  - Spontaneous ventilation with inhalational induction is preferable to prevent distal migration of the obstruction.
  - Despite this, positive pressure ventilation with opiates and neuromuscular blockade has been successfully used when the foreign body is impacted and unlikely to be displaced.

## Anaesthesia for Sleeve Resection

- **Indications**:
  - Malignant neoplasm invading the lobar or main-stem bronchus.
  - Sleeve lobectomy or resection can spare healthy tissue and avoid more extensive surgery, improving survival and reducing lung function loss.
- **Anaesthetic Technique**:
  - Standard double lumen tube employed.
  - Anaesthetic course similar to that for other types of lung tissue resection.

## Anaesthesia for Airway Stenting

- **Indications**:
  - Airway stents provide symptomatic relief for obstructing non-resectable intrinsic or extrinsic tumours.
  - Rarely used as a bridge to curative treatment.
- **Procedure**:
  - Self-expanding stents can be fluoroscopically inserted through an endotracheal tube.
  - Rigid bronchoscopy provides better conditions for deployment of all stent types, following the same principles as for rigid bronchoscopy.
- **Considerations**:
  - For patients with existing airway stents presenting for unrelated surgery, airway instrumentation should be avoided unless fibreoptic guidance is available.

## Anaesthesia for Tracheal Resection

- **Indications**:
  - Tracheal stenosis of neoplastic or iatrogenic (post-intubation/tracheostomy) origin.
  - Adults can safely tolerate resection of up to 50% of tracheal rings.
- **Surgical Approach and Incisions**:
  - High tracheal resection: Low collar cervical incision.
  - Middle tracheal resection: Combined cervical incision and upper sternal split, full sternotomy, or right thoracotomy.
  - Lower tracheal resection: Postero-lateral right thoracotomy in the fourth intercostal space.
  - Carinal resection: Postero-lateral right thoracotomy in the fourth intercostal space; main-stem bronchial intubation.

### Anaesthetic Management

- **General Anaesthesia**:
  - TIVA is commonly used due to potential periods where the airway is open and unprotected.
- **Right Thoracotomy Approach**:
  - Epidural or paravertebral block for perioperative and postoperative analgesia.
- **Patient Positioning**:
  - Supine with neck extension to optimize surgical exposure.
  - ETT initially positioned distal to the obstruction to avoid central obstruction through surgical manipulation.
- **Intraoperative Management**:
  - A rigid bronchoscope may be used for dilation of the airway or removal of an endoluminal tumour.
  - In cases of near or complete obstruction, the rigid rescue bronchoscope may be the primary means of airway management.
  - An arterial line is placed on the right to alert the team to compression of the brachiocephalic or innominate artery.
  - Access to the head must be preserved to allow for manipulation of the endotracheal tube and bronchoscope.
- **Surgical Procedure**:
  - The trachea is dissected, and the orotracheal tube is withdrawn to the cricoid cartilage.
- **Airway Management Options During Segmental Resection**:
  - There are three common options, each with specific advantages and disadvantages.

### Common Procedures and Considerations in Tracheal Resection

#### Intraoperative Management
- **Placement of Endotracheal Tube:**
  - Utilization of a sterile armoured cuffed endotracheal tube placed under surgical vision in the distal trachea is common.
  - Post-anastomotic reconstruction, the native orotracheal tube is advanced back to its original position under bronchoscopic vision.

#### Postoperative Management
- At the end of the procedure, the patient should be:
  - Extubated awake
  - Warm
  - Well oxygenated
  - Cardiovascularly stable
- **Head Position:**
  - A neutral head position is recommended to reduce tension on the anastomosis.
  - A guardian stitch is used to ensure neck flexion for the first postoperative week.

#### Considerations for Unrelated Surgeries Post-Tracheal Resection
- **Increased Risk of Endobronchial Intubation:**
  - Due to a shortened trachea, there is an increased risk of endobronchial intubation.
  - It is crucial that the endotracheal cuff does not sit across the anastomosis, where there could be narrowing, as it may cause further tissue injury and stenosis.
- **Preferred Techniques:**
  - Techniques to avoid intubation are preferred to mitigate risks associated with a shortened trachea and potential anastomotic complications.

## Anaesthesia for Carinal Resection

- **Indications**:
	- Less common than tracheal resection, usually for malignant neoplastic invasion.
- **Patient Selection**:
	- Good performance status with minimal cardiovascular or respiratory disease burden.
	- Mortality from the procedure is greater than 5%.

### Operative Course and Anaesthetic Management

- **Anaesthetic Techniques**:
	
	- Similar to tracheal resection.
	- For right carinal resections, a long armoured single lumen endotracheal tube is placed into the left main bronchus.
	- During the resection, the tube is withdrawn to the cricoid cartilage and replaced with a sterile distal armoured cuffed tube.
	- Jet ventilation can also be used.
	- Following the resection, the native orotracheal tube is readvanced into the left main bronchus.
- **Surgical Approach**:
	
	- Bilateral procedures require a median sternotomy or right thoracotomy.
	- Lesser-resected bronchus is first anastomosed with the trachea.
	- The shorter bronchus is reconnected to the sidewall of the longer bronchus.

### Complications and Considerations

- **Major Complications**:
	
	- Anastomotic dehiscence (11-17%)
	- Post-pneumonectomy pulmonary oedema
- **Unrelated Surgery Considerations**:
	
	- Avoid pushing a tube too distally.
	- If lung isolation is required, carinal anatomy will be abnormal, and endobronchial techniques may be necessary.
	- Fibreoptic guidance is essential for tube placement confirmation and distal airway assessment.
# Sinus Surgery

## Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS)

### Introduction

- Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a common procedure in ENT with a high success rate (approximately 90%) for symptomatic improvement in patients with medically refractory chronic rhinosinusitis and chronic polypous rhinosinusitis.
- Adverse events are rare, with major complications including:
  - Dura puncture
  - Cerebrospinal fluid leak
  - Meningitis
  - Orbital and optic nerve trauma
  - Extensive haemorrhage

### Local or General Anaesthesia

- FESS was initially performed under topical anaesthesia with sedation, allowing patients to signal pain or discomfort and minimizing trauma and complications.
- Advances in surgical techniques have made more aggressive resections possible, favoring general anaesthesia to:
  - Ensure an immobile surgical field
  - Provide effective airway protection
  - Ensure adequate analgesia
  - Enhance patient comfort
- Local anaesthesia remains suitable for minor procedures in selected patients, but general anaesthesia is preferred for most cases.

### Minimising Surgical Bleeding

- Haemorrhage reduces visibility of the surgical field during FESS and is linked to increased risk of complications and procedural failure.
- Controlling capillary bleeding is essential, achieved by decreasing mean arterial pressure and local vasoconstriction.

#### Methods to Decrease Haemorrhage

1. **Positioning**
   - Reverse Trendelenburg (15° head up) promotes venous decongestion of the upper body, reducing arterial blood pressure supply.

2. **Preoperative Steroid Administration**
   - Used for severe nasal polyposis to reduce mucosal oedema and improve visibility during the procedure.

3. **Injected and Topical Local Anaesthetics and Vasoconstrictors**
   - Reduce postoperative pain, blood loss, and mucosal congestion.
   - Common vasoconstrictors include cocaine, epinephrine, and phenylephrine, which require caution in patients with cardiovascular conditions.

4. **Body Temperature Maintenance**
   - Normothermia is vital for platelet function and coagulation.

5. **Maintenance of Anaesthesia Depth**
   - Prevents patient coughing or straining, which increases intrathoracic pressure and surgical bleeding.
   - Muscle relaxants and controlled ventilation help maintain low airway pressures.

6. **Choice of Anaesthetic Agent**
   - Propofol TIVA may reduce intra-operative blood loss and improve surgical visibility, though recent studies show mixed results.
   - Volatile agents cause vasodilation and may increase bleeding.

7. **Remifentanil**
   - Short-acting opioid that controls blood pressure surges due to surgical pain and allows for better blood pressure management.

8. **Controlled Hypotension**
   - Deliberate reduction of systemic blood pressure by 20% to decrease capillary blood loss, with careful monitoring to avoid reduced perfusion to vital organs.
   - Contraindications include cerebrovascular insufficiency, coronary disease, and decompensated heart failure.

### Airway Choices

- **Endotracheal Tube (ETT)**
  - Provides a cuffed seal below the vocal cords, preventing aspiration and protecting the airway.
  - Armoured ETTs resist kinking and are preferred for their flexibility.
- **Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA)**
  - Not traditionally seen as protective against aspiration but may have advantages in reducing haemodynamic response and improving post-operative recovery.
  - Flexible LMA preferred for its resistance to kinking.
  - Requires careful management to prevent dislodgement and ensure proper seal.

### Smooth Emergence and Reversal

- Smooth emergence avoids post-surgical bleeding, sore throat, and patient discomfort.
- **Lignocaine** is used to reduce coughing and straining, administered intravenously, as a local spray, or filling the ETT cuff.
- **Remifentanil** controls haemodynamic responses and ensures rapid recovery.
- **Deep vs. Awake Extubation**: Deep extubation may allow smoother emergence, while awake extubation allows airway protection but has higher risks of coughing and bleeding.

### Post-operative Care

- **Nausea and Vomiting**
  - Caused by blood in the stomach, throat inflammation, and opioid use.
  - Prophylaxis with ondansetron and dexamethasone, and gastric decompression with an orogastric tube is recommended.
  - Propofol TIVA reduces post-operative nausea compared to volatile anaesthesia.
- **Post-operative Pain**
  - Mild to moderate, managed with pre-operative local anaesthetics and routine non-opioid analgesics, with opioids as rescue medication.
  - Acetaminophen and NSAIDs/cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors are commonly used for effective analgesia.

## Introduction

Total laryngectomy involves the en bloc removal of laryngeal structures, including the epiglottis, hyoid, and a variable amount of upper trachea. This procedure necessitates the creation of a permanent tracheostomy and repair of the pharynx. It is typically performed for advanced laryngeal cancer, either as a primary treatment or as surgical salvage following failure of laryngeal preservation treatments (radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy). Concomitant neck dissections and pharyngeal reconstruction using pedicled flaps or free tissue transfer may also be involved.

## Laryngeal Cancer

Total laryngectomy is an effective procedure for treating laryngeal cancer, associated with good functional outcomes.

- T3 tumors: organ preservation is preferred.
- T4 tumors invading the laryngeal cartilages: total laryngectomy is recommended.

Long-term complications of oncological treatments may result in a ‘frozen larynx,’ requiring a tracheostomy, gastrostomy, or ultimately a laryngectomy to prevent aspiration.

### Epidemiology
- Laryngeal cancer accounts for less than 1% of all new cancer diagnoses in the UK.
- The 5-year survival rate is 62%.
- Male to female ratio: 4:1.
- Risk factors: smoking, alcohol consumption.

## Surgical Techniques
### Preoperative Tracheostomy

There is a move away from performing preoperative tracheostomy due to:

- Poorer wound healing, especially in patients who have undergone radiotherapy.
- Higher rate of tracheostomal cancer recurrence.

### Tracheal Tube Selection

The choice of tracheal tube depends on the tumor's bulk, generally a small reinforced tube is acceptable.

### Tracheostomy Formation

When the trachea is resected from the larynx, the tracheostomy is formed on the skin:

- The tracheal tube is withdrawn, and a laryngectomy anaesthetic tube is used for the remainder of the procedure.
- This tube can be sutured to the chest wall for security.
- At the end of surgery, a cuffed tracheostomy tube is inserted for the first 24 hours to assist with suctioning and prevent blood aspiration post-operation.

### Neck Dissection

Neck dissection is often performed simultaneously with total laryngectomy:

- Modifications of radical neck dissection or selective neck dissections are common.
- Selective neck dissection aims to remove nodes most at risk for metastases, particularly those related to the jugular vein (levels 2–4) and other nodal stations such as levels 1, 5, 6, and 7.
- Complications include bleeding, increased intracranial pressure if the internal jugular vein is ligated, nerve palsies, and injury to the thoracic duct.

### Complications
- **Nerve Palsies:** Affecting the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve, hypoglossal nerve, accessory nerve, phrenic nerve, and cervical plexus.
- **Bleeding:** Increased intracranial pressure if the internal jugular vein is ligated.
- **Injury to Thoracic Duct:** Recognized by milky fluid in surgical drains, managed conservatively or surgically for high-volume chyle fistula.

## Clinical Presentation
### Red Flag Symptoms
- Persistent hoarseness
- Dysphagia
- Odynophagia
- Otalgia
- Cervical adenopathy
- Haemoptysis
- Acute stridor (uncommon but possible)

## Anaesthesia for Laryngeal Cancer Patients
### Preoperative Assessment
- **Preliminary Investigations:** Standard tests, treating iron deficiency anaemia (preferably IV route due to lower anaphylaxis rate with newer preparations).
- **Cardiovascular Disease:** Specialist opinion for unstable angina, recent stenting, decompensated heart failure, severe aortic stenosis. Most patients require group and save of blood rather than full crossmatch.
- **Respiratory Disease:** Significant in laryngectomy patients who are often heavy smokers. Pulmonary function tests can be unreliable in the presence of laryngeal narrowing.
- **Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing:** Useful for risk stratification, with METS estimation aiding in assessing functional status.
- **Other Considerations:** Controlled alcohol withdrawal and preoperative smoking cessation are recommended.

### Risk and Optimization
- **Risk Assessment:** Intermediate risk surgery, use of SORT and POSSUM scores for morbidity prediction, tailored discussions about consent and risk.
- **Optimization:** Routine management of cardiovascular or respiratory disease with a multidisciplinary approach, involving dietitians for nutritional optimization.

## Planning Airway Management
### Airway Assessment
- **History and Examination:** Assess for voice change, dysphagia, breathlessness, stridor, and difficulty with front of neck access.
- **Imaging:** Nasendoscopy, CT, and MRI to assess airway narrowing and plan management.

### Preoperative Questions
1. How will I preoxygenate?
2. Will I be able to use facemask ventilation (FMV)?
3. Will I be able to get a good view of the cords?
4. Will I be able to intubate?
5. How easy would front of neck access (FONA) be?

### Emergency Management
- High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) for preoxygenation and apnoeic oxygenation.
- **Preinduction Management:** Use of CPAP, adrenaline, steroids, heliox (CASH acronym). Anaesthetize in theatre with the consultant surgeon present, discuss plans A, B, C, and D.

## Perioperative Management
### Intraoperative
- **Monitoring:** Adhere to AAGBI standards, invasive blood pressure monitoring, temperature, and urinary catheter placement.
- **Anesthesia:** Short-acting agents for rapid emergence, TIVA preferred, remifentanil recommended.

### Postoperative
- **Care Level:** High-dependency unit initially, step down to specialist ward care within 48 hours.
- **Analgesia:** Intraoperative morphine, simple analgesics, postoperative PCA, and oral morphine as required.

### Specific Safety Concerns
- Training for first responders on laryngectomy stomas, access to National Tracheostomy Patient Safety Project resources, and emergency drills for tracheostomy and laryngectomy management.

## Management of Post-Laryngectomy Patients for Other Procedures
### Surgical Variations
- **Tracheal Stoma:** Indicates total laryngectomy. Partial laryngectomy patients may not have a stoma but may exhibit narrowed laryngeal structures.
- **Partial Laryngectomy Types:** Vertical partial laryngectomy or supracricoid laryngectomy, requiring smaller intubation tubes and possibly aided by video laryngoscopy.

### Laryngectomy Stoma Management
- **Oxygenation and Ventilation:** Preoxygenation over the stoma, use of a pediatric facemask, laryngeal mask airway, or reinforced tracheal tube.
- **Concerns:** Proper oxygen delivery and airway management in non-specialist environments.
