## Introduction

- The distinction between aesthetic surgery (cosmetic surgery) and reconstructive surgery is blurred in the medical literature, but officially there is a clear distinction.
- The distinction in the definition is important when it comes to the types of procedures as well as the funding by medical insurers.
- The American Medical Association (AMA) definitions:
  - Aesthetic surgery: "surgery to reshape normal structures of the body in order to improve the patients’ appearance and self-esteem"
  - Reconstructive surgery: "surgery performed on abnormal structures of the body, caused by congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumours or disease"
- Three main categories of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Procedures:
  - **Aesthetic Plastic Surgical Procedures of the face:**
	- Browlift
	- Blepharoplasty (Eyelid rejuvenation)
	- Rhinoplasty (Nasal cosmetic procedure)
	- Facelift and Necklift
	- Midface Lift (Rejuvenation of the lower lid/cheek junction)
	- Otoplasty (Procedures to reposition protruding ears)
	- Alloplastic augmentation (facial implants designed to enhance facial volume)
	- Fat grafting (techniques to add volume by removal and injection of a patient's fat)
	- Other soft tissue fillers. (Examples: Restylane, Perlane, Juvederm, Hylaform, Cosmederm, Cosmeplast, Artefill, Radiesse, Sculptra)
  - **Aesthetic Plastic Surgical Procedures of the breast:**
	- Augmentation Mammoplasty (Breast enlargement)
	- Mastopexy (Breast lift often combined with Breast Augmentation)
	- Reduction Mammoplasty (Reduce the size of the breast often for functional as well as aesthetic improvement)
  - **Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Procedures for Body Contouring:**
	- Liposuction (removal of deposits of fat by traditional suction techniques or the adjunctive use of ultrasonic energy to aid in fat removal)
- Generally performed on healthy ASA 1 and 2 patients and is peripheral surgery.

## Differences of Aesthetic Surgery to Other Routine Peripheral Surgery

- The type of patient and their expectations
- The fact that the surgery is not essential
- Procedures can be lengthy
- Expectations by the surgeon for the anaesthetist to perform exceptionally well
- Medical insurers do not fund these types of procedures or the complications that may arise
- The physical location where these surgeries are performed
- The need for privacy
- The need to push boundaries for patients who are not "completely healthy"
- Surgical practices impacting anaesthetic management, with most studies and evidence from surgical literature rather than anaesthetic literature.

## Top Five Surgical Procedures Overall

- Breast augmentation
- Liposuction
- Abdominoplasty
- Eyelid surgery
- Rhinoplasty

## Physiological Considerations and Complications

- Most aesthetic procedures are not associated with major physiological disturbances, except liposuction and abdominoplasty or a combination of both these procedures.
- Complications relating to obesity and previous gastric bypass surgery.
- Disease states that may co-exist with obesity:
  - Hypertension
  - Coronary artery disease
  - Diabetes
  - Obstructive sleep apnea
- Morbidly obese patients (BMI > 35) carry a greater risk, particularly when sedation or general anaesthesia is contemplated.
- BMI should be part of the pre-operative examination.
- Patients with sleep apnea are more sensitive to respiratory depressants such as sedatives and analgesics and should be observed in hospital for a period post-procedure.

## Pre-Operative Interrogation: Medication and Herbal Preparations

- A major complication of most aesthetic procedures is peri-operative bleeding.
- Patients are generally advised to stop all NSAIDS, aspirin, and vitamin E two weeks prior to surgery.
- Many patients won’t consider herbal supplements as medication: specifically ask about them.
  - Herbal preparations that may inhibit platelet function and cause bleeding include:
	- Echinacea
	- Ephedra
	- Kava
	- Ginkgo Biloba
	- St. John’s wort
	- Garlic
	- Ginseng
	- Grapefruit juice in excess quantities

## Lignocaine Metabolism and Toxicity

- Lignocaine is metabolized in the liver by de-ethylation to an active metabolite monoethylglycinexylidid.
- Lignocaine in toxic plasma concentration (>5 µg/ml) may cause seizures and myocardial depression.
- The metabolite may also cause seizures.
- Metabolism of lignocaine mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in the liver, particularly the iso-enzymes 1A2 and 3A4.
- Drugs that interact with these enzyme systems include:
  - Antibiotics (erythromycin, tetracycline, and metronidazole)
  - Statins
  - Benzodiazepines
  - Tricyclic antidepressants
  - Antiepileptics (valproic acid and carbamazepine)
  - Calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil)
  - Narcotics (alfentanyl, fentanyl)
  - Cyclosporine
  - Sildenafil
  - Protease inhibitors

## Anaesthesia Settings

- Aesthetic procedures may be performed in:
  - The surgeon’s rooms (office-based)
  - Aesthetic clinics
  - Hospitals
- Most office-based procedures in South Africa are minor liposuction procedures involving the chin, arms, and other small areas where local deposits of fat may accumulate, usually done with minor sedation administered by the surgeon.
- More extensive surgical procedures are performed in aesthetic/day clinics or hospitals.
- Procedures performed outside of a hospital setting must adhere to minimal standards, including:
  - Ability to supply supplemental oxygen and a means for IPPV
  - Suction
  - A crash cart
  - Defibrillation
  - Non-invasive monitors, including a BIS monitor in the USA

## Anaesthesia Administration Outside Hospital Setting

- Anaesthesia (sedation) should be administered by a physician skilled in airway management and competent in basic resuscitative skills.
- Anaesthesia administered outside the hospital setting should provide:
  - Rapid awakening
  - Minimal to no pain
  - No post-operative nausea and vomiting
- Many different regimens are used by anaesthesiologists in the out-of-hospital setting to meet these objectives.
  - The Propofol Ketamine (PK) technique, perfected by Dr. B. L. Friedberg in the USA, provides an almost ideal combination of drugs.
  - Slow titration of Propofol boluses until the patient loses the eyelash reflex and verbal response.
  - Description of the PK technique:
	- "I set my Harvard Clinical infusion pump for 250 μg/kg/20 sec for mini-induction boluses and the base rate at 100 μg/kg/min. Most patients require between one to six boluses to achieve either loss of lid reflex (LLR) or loss of verbal response (LVR) without the BIS or a BIS 70-75 before the dissociative dose of ketamine.
	- Base rate is adjusted upwards or downwards according to clinical signs or to maintain BIS 60-70.
	- After the induction, a bolus 50 mg dose of ketamine is given and the surgeon is given the "two minute warning" after which a 10-20 minute window of opportunity should exist in which the surgeon can inject the local anaesthetic that comprises the "analgesia" portion of the case.
	- Once the local is injected, there is no reason to continue to give more ketamine except:
	  - The surgeon only wants to inject one side of the face or one breast at a time.
	  - A dissociative effect (no movement in response to the injection) was not obtained with the initial dose.
	  - One cannot keep the patient still enough for the surgery despite an initial plus two additional injections of local to the operative field."

## Liposuction

- Liposuction is the second most performed aesthetic procedure in the USA:
  - Many are performed office-based by plastic surgeons and dermatologists.
  - Anaesthesiologists have variable involvement and should be well-acquainted with issues related to obesity, fluid management, and co-morbid disease states.
- Techniques for Aspiration of Fat:
  - **Dry Technique**: No infiltration of the tissue. Blood loss: 20-45% of the aspirated volume.
  - **Wet Technique**: 200-300 ml of wetting solution is injected per area. Blood loss: 4-30% of the aspirate volume.
  - **Super Wet Technique**: 1 ml of fluid injected per estimated ml of expected aspirate. Blood loss: 1% of the aspirate volume.
  - **Tumescent Technique**: 3-4 ml of fluid injected per estimated ml of expected aspirate. Blood loss: 1% of the aspirate volume.

- Most common solution used devised by Dr. Klein or with minor modifications:
  - **Klein’s Solution**:
	- 1000 ml Normal saline
	- 50 ml, 1% lignocaine
	- 1 ml, 1:1000 epinephrine
	- 12.5 ml, 8.4% sodium bicarbonate
  - **Hunstadt’s Solution**:
	- 1000 ml Ringer’s lactate
	- 50 ml, 1% lignocaine
	- 1 ml, 1:1000 epinephrine

### Volume

 of Aspirate

- Liposuction can be:
  - High volume (>4000 ml aspirate)
  - Low volume (<4000 ml aspirate)
- Large volume liposuction is more dangerous due to significant fluid shifts:
  - Estimated 30-50% of pre-infiltrate solution is removed by aspiration.
  - Up to 70% of residual volume may reach the intravascular compartment resulting in fluid overload and pulmonary oedema if excess intravenous fluid is given.
  - Limit additional fluid:
	- Maintenance fluid for aspirate volumes less than 4000 ml.
	- Replacement fluid at 0.25 ml per ml aspirated over 5000 ml in super wet techniques.
	- No additional intravenous fluid required in the true tumescent technique.

### Anaesthesia Conduct for Liposuction

- Can be done under local anaesthesia to avoid anaesthetic risk.
- **Pre-op assessment**:
  - Patients' expectations are high.
  - Comorbidities: Obesity (Bariatric surgery)/HPT/CAD/OSA/DM.
- **Medications**:
  - Herbal remedies and drugs to help lose weight (amphetamines and thyroid hormones) - must stop all 2 weeks prior.
- **Location**:
  - Day case, aesthetic clinic (remote location).
- **Haemodynamics**:
  - Adrenaline absorption can result in a 40-50% increase in HR and cardiac output.
  - EEG monitoring may differentiate CV response from altered depth of anaesthesia.
- **Fluids**:
  - Liposuction removes only 30% of the injected fluid = risk of fluid overload.
  - Limit additional fluid to maintenance fluids in low volume aspirates and 0.25 ml/ml aspirated once aspirate is over 5000 ml in super wet techniques.
  - No fluid needed for tumescent techniques.
- **Temperature**:
  - Risk of hypothermia.
- **Position**:
  - May require changing or prone position.
- **Drugs**:
  - Lignocaine toxicity - consider drug interactions, may need dose reduction.
  - Metabolised by CYP 3A4 and 1A2.
  - Drugs that interact: Statins, benzos, TCA, Ca channel blockers, protease inhibitors, sildenafil, antiepileptics & some antibiotics (erythro, tetracycline & metronidazole).
- **Electrolytes**:
  - Mild hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia occur due to fluid absorption.
- **Complications**:
  - DVT/PE, fat embolism, pulmonary oedema, visceral perforation, LAST, hypothermia.

### Nutritional Optimization

- Malnutrition
- Micronutrient deficiency (correct with supplementation)
- Higher risk for anaemia
- Intense calorie-restricting diet in the weeks before surgery to reduce intra-abdominal fat and liver size, making surgery easier and potentially improving patient outcomes.

## Abdominoplasty

- Raised intragastric and pulmonary pressures associated with sheath plication and greater immobility put patients at higher risk of PTED.
- These procedures have been successfully done with tumescent techniques with a reported lower incidence of complications.
- **Forced air warmers**:
  - Case reports from Australia where patients developed post-operative necrotizing fasciitis when the warming hose was placed under the drapes.
  - Hypothesized that warm air current blowing over the perineum introduces bacteria into the operative field.
  - Recommendation: always use an approved warming blanket with the device.
- Some surgeons request avoiding NSAIDs as they feel the incidence of seromas is greater due to fluid retention.

### Indications for Surgical Intervention

- **Adults with BMI ≥ 40** with or without comorbidity.
- **Adults with BMI 35–39.9** with at least one of the following:
  - T2DM (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus)
  - OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) / OHS (Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome)
  - Hypertension
  - Dyslipidaemia
  - NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) / NASH (Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis)
  - Gourd (Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease)
  - Asthma
  - Debilitating arthritis
  - Disqualified for other surgery due to weight
- **Adults with BMI 30–34.9** with uncontrollable T2DM or Metabolic Syndrome.

## Facelifts

- Long procedures that if done under local anaesthesia alone will require sedation.
- Pain after a facelift may indicate haematoma formation, which if small can be drained in the surgeon's office but if large may require a GA.

## Breast Augmentation

- The most common surgical aesthetic procedure performed in the USA.
- Breast haematomas and PONV are the most common medical and surgical complications.

## Brazilian Butt Lift

- Not a very common procedure.
- Involves either inserting a prosthesis or injecting fat into the gluteus maximus muscle.
- If fat is injected, a large fat harvest needs to be performed under a near dry technique.
- Complications include:
  - Large blood loss
  - Potential fat embolism
  - SIRS response
  - Rhabdomyolysis
  - Hyperkalaemia
  - Renal failure
  - Severe thrombocytopaenia

### Jess Summary for Bariatric Surgery
**Early on the list!!**
**Positioning**:
	Risk/ benefit of intubating in the head up position
	Risk: CV  compromise (Co-loading with 500ml fluid on induction may help)
	Benefit: Increased FRC, reduced reflux risk
	If possible: Self positioning prior to induction to avoid moving patient and risking harm to patient and healthcare workers after induction
	Hip abducted, slightly extend lumbar lordosis to optomise surgical access.
**Padding:**
	Increased risk of nerve injury, pressure sores and rhabdomyolysis
	Memory foam, jell pads and bean bags
	Arms must not be abducted beyond 90 degrees
**Vascular access:**
	Difficult
	Ultrasound helps
	May need CVP
**Monitors:**
	Arterial line is BP cuff not fitting well or CV indication
	Can use NIBP on forarm
	BIS/ entropy (altered pharmacokinetics in obesity)
	TO4 monitoring
**Airway:**
	Plan A, B, C. (not necessarily a more difficult intubation, but if it fails more difficult to oxygenate and do FONA)
	Demarcate cricoid membrane with US beforehand
	Minimise apnoeic time (severe drop in sats within 2-3 mins). THRIVE can increased apnoeic time
	RSI if Gourd or hiatus hernia (usually have g-scope prior to surgery)
	Extubate to CPAP if they have home CPAP. Use patients machine (ask for a demonstration of how to use prior)
**Ventilation:**
	Reduced lung complianceImproved with head up position and extended lumbar lordosis
	PEEP10-15cmH2O
**NGT:**
	Discuss surgical needs...into stomach or in oesophagus, dye to test for leaks, suction blood and dye out at end to avoid nausea
**Extubation:**
	Complete reversal of muscle relaxation
	Fully awake extubation
	Head up position
**DVT prophylaxis:**
	Calf compressors
	Enoxeparin

**Drugs:**
	Opioid minimisation/ free anaesthetic.
	Desflurane or TIVA.
**PD/PK:**
	Body weight adjustments for drugs.
	TCI not validated in obese patients (eleveld proprofol model performs the best).
**PONV:**
	Triple therapy: Dexamethasone 8mg + Droperidol 0.01mg/kg (ABW) + ondansetron 4mg (rescue: promethazine 0.1mg/kg ABW (6.25mg))
	Opioid free TIVA superior for PONV prophylaxis
	Avoidance of neostigmine if sugammadex is available
