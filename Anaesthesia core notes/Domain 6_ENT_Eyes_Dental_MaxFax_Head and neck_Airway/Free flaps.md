# History and Hierarchy of Reconstructive Surgery

## History of Reconstructive Surgery
- **Free Tissue Transfer:** Essential for managing large defects to:
  - Reduce infection
  - Maintain skin integrity
  - Restore aesthetic form
- **Advancements in Free Flap Transfer:**
  - 1960s: Microscopic anastomosis of blood vessels perfected
  - 1972: McLean and Buncke successfully transferred an omental flap for scalp reconstruction
  - Modern Era: Free flap surgery is the gold standard with success rates exceeding 90%
  - Factors influencing flap success are better understood, allowing anesthetists to optimize conditions for flap survival

## Hierarchy of Reconstructive Surgery for Large Defects

### Skin Grafts
- Types: Full thickness or split skin grafts
- Painful procedure
- Adherence via fibrin production
- Revascularization through capillary bud growth from recipient site

### Tissue Expanders
- Saline-filled balloons inserted under the skin and gradually expanded
- Expanded skin used to cover a neighboring defect

### Local Flaps
- Used to cover an adjoining defect or surgical site
- No disruption of vessels and nerves

### Pedicled Flaps
- Maintain their neurovascular supply, moved on their pedicle to cover a nearby defect
- Examples:
  - Latissimus dorsi flap for breast reconstruction
  - Pectoralis major flap for head and neck reconstruction
- No microvascular anastomosis needed; however, flap failure can occur due to pedicle twisting, stretching, or compression

### Free Flaps
- Involves transfer of skin, muscle, and sometimes bone, along with vessels to a defect site
- Requires microscopic vascular anastomosis at the recipient site
- Stages of Free Flap Transfer:
  - **Elevation of the Flap:** Vessels clamped once flap is dissected
  - **Primary Ischaemic Period:** Anaerobic metabolism, capillary narrowing due to endothelial swelling, vasoconstriction, and edema
  - **Reperfusion:** Blood flow re-established, reversing ischaemic changes; reperfusion injury may occur if conditions are poor
  - **Secondary Ischaemia:** Occurs post-reperfusion due to poor flow determinants, causing more extensive damage than primary ischaemia

## Reasons for Flap Failure
- Anastomotic failure (arterial or venous)
- Vasospasm
- Thrombosis (patient predisposition, hematocrit, transfusion, secondary ischaemic insult)
- External compression (tight bandaging, poor patient positioning)
- Oedema (excessive crystalloid administration, excessive handling, prolonged ischaemic time)

## Physiology of the Free Flap
- **Microcirculation:** Critical for flap survival; allows blood flow and waste removal
- **Starling's Revised Equation:** Describes net filtration and reabsorption of plasma across capillary beds
- **Flow Regulation:**
  - **Distant Factors:** Neural sympathetic effects, catecholamine release
  - **Local Factors:** Myogenic response, metabolic factors (increased levels of potassium, hydrogen, osmolarity, adenosine, PCO2; decreased levels of PO2)
  - **Rheology:** Blood flow behavior affected by RBC deformability, hematocrit, and conditions like hypothermia, which impair RBC deformability and increase viscosity

- **Preoperative:** Thorough cardiovascular assessment, optimization of patients with risk factors
- **Intraoperative:**
  - **Prevent Hypothermia:** Maintain theatre temperature, prewarm patient, use warm fluids
  - **Positioning and Pressure Point Protection:** Essential for prolonged surgery
  - **Anticoagulation:** Calf compressors, preoperative heparin or other anticoagulants as per protocol
  - **Maintenance:** Sevoflurane-based anesthesia, regional anesthesia to improve flow and reduce opioid needs
  - **Monitoring:** Invasive blood pressure monitoring, CVP lines if necessary, regular fluid status monitoring
  - **Fluid Management:** Appropriate crystalloid infusion (3.5-6 ml/kg/hr), blood gas analysis, urine output, temperature differentials, cardiac output monitoring
  - **Ventilation:** Ensure good oxygenation and normocapnia; avoid hypercapnia

## Guidelines for Flap Surgery Optimization
- **Patient Temperature:** Maintain normothermia to prevent vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and increased viscosity
- **Fluid Status:** Avoid high volumes of crystalloid; optimize volume to ensure adequate perfusion
- **Transfusion Thresholds:** Transfusion associated with complications; aim for a hemoglobin level of 7 g/dL in healthy patients, hematocrit around 30%
- **Anaesthetic Agents:** Sevoflurane for endothelium protection, regional anesthesia for better flow and reduced thrombosis
- **Anticoagulation:** Use of pneumatic calf compressors
- **Vasopressor Use:** Noradrenaline supported by evidence for use without compromising flap survival
- **Ventilation:** Maintain normal CO2 and PO2 levels

## Stages of Flap Surgery
1. Elevation and clamping of vessels
2. Primary ischaemic period (anaerobic metabolism, narrowed capillaries due to endothelial swelling, edema, vasoconstriction)
3. Reperfusion (avoid prolonged ischaemic time and poor perfusion pressure to prevent reperfusion injury)
4. Secondary ischaemia (optimize flow in flap to prevent secondary damage)
