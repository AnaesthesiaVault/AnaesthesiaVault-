# Laser Surgery

## Risk Reduction

**ETT:**
- Laser-resistant type
- Saline with blue dye in cuff (heat sink and indicates leak)

**Skin and Eyes:**
- Goggles
- Cover patient's eyes
- Allow cleaning prep to dry
- Cover hair with lubricating jelly (reduces combustion risk)
- Use non-combustible drapes

**Gas Mixture:**
- Avoid N2O
- Low O2 concentration

## Airway Fires

- **Components required for an airway fire**:
  - Fuel (ETT, drapes, alcohol prep)
  - Oxidizer (O2 or nitrous oxide)
  - Ignition source (laser, diathermy)
- **Risk Reduction**:
  - Administer the lowest possible FiO2 to maintain satisfactory O2 saturation and avoid nitrous oxide.
  - Use polytetrafluoroethylene catheters (LaserJet or Hunsaker Mon-Jet) for infraglottic jet ventilation.
  - Use laser-resistant ETTs like the MallinkrodtTM Laser flex tube.
  - Use water instead of air to obtain a cuff seal

, adding methylene blue to the fluid to recognize airway puncture.

  - Keep wet pledgets around PVC tubes moist during surgery if a laser-resistant ETT is not used.
  - Implement a fire drill as part of the WHO checklist.
  - Keep a 50 ml syringe filled with saline available for extinguishing an airway fire.
- **Protocol for Airway Fire**:
  1. Remove the tracheal tube and have another team member extinguish it.
  2. Remove pledgets and any ETT pieces left in the airway.
  3. Pour saline or water into the airway to cool tissues.
  4. Reestablish the airway and resume ventilation with air until certain nothing is smoldering, then switch to 100% oxygen.
  5. Examine the airway for damage and treat accordingly.

- **Prevention of Injury to Staff**:
  - Wear protective eye glasses.
  - Place warning notices on theatre doors during laser surgery.
  - Wear masks if papillomata are being resected.
  - Use non-reflective instruments.

## Postoperative Considerations Following Airway Surgery

- **Potential Problems**:
  - Airway obstruction
  - Bleeding
  - Laryngospasm
  - Laryngeal incompetence
- Administer dexamethasone or betamethasone intraoperatively to reduce oedema.
- Nurse patients in a semi-sitting position and extubate awake or under deep anesthesia.
- Humidify oxygen and administer nebulized adrenaline for patients with stridor.
- Heliox may be administered to reduce the work of breathing.
# Anaesthesia for Direct Laryngoscopy and Microlaryngeal Surgery

## How a Laser Works

- **Absorption of energy by the atom**: Electrons jump from low energy orbit to a high energy orbit, resulting in atomic excitation.
- **Spontaneous emission**: As electrons return to the ground state, they release energy in the form of a photon with random phase and direction.
- **Stimulated emission**: A photon is reflected back into the optical cavity, colliding with an excited atom. The electron in the excited atom returns to ground state, releasing two photons with identical phase, direction, polarization, and wavelength.
- **Population inversion**: Maintenance of the atoms in an excited state by an energy source.
- Some photons escape from the lasing medium through a partially reflective mirror (output coupler).

## General

- Microlaryngeal surgery involves the use of a microscope for surgeries on the larynx.
- **Direct Laryngoscopy (DL)** is used for:
  - Assessment of laryngeal pathology
  - Laryngeal procedures such as laser ablation of localized lesions, nodules, or papillomatosis
- Cooperation between anaesthetist and surgeon is crucial due to the shared airway.
- The anesthetic should provide:
  - Adequate depth of anesthesia/sedation
  - An unobstructed and immobile operative field
  - Adequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal
  - Rapid return of airway reflexes after surgery

### Pre-operative Assessment

- History of previous radiotherapy is important.
- Assess for cardiac and respiratory disease.
- Examination:
  - Presence/absence of stridor
  - Hoarseness/shortness of breath
  - Mallampati score, neck mobility, and dental examination
  - Note poor dentition/gingivitis; may require a gum guard
  - Inform patients of the risk of dental damage during the procedure
- Special investigations:
  - Most recent indirect/nasal fibreoptic endoscopy notes of the larynx
  - CXR
  - CT scans/MRI to assess the position of subglottic lesions
  - Previous anesthetic notes and latest nasopharyngeal examination report
- Discuss with the surgeon:
  - If intubation with MLT will provide satisfactory surgical conditions
  - Use of laser
- If difficult intubation is likely:
  - Ensure a difficult airway trolley and Sanders injector or High-frequency jet ventilator are in the theatre
  - With critical airway stenosis, ensure an experienced surgeon is present
	- Consider tracheostomy under local anesthesia
	- Be prepared for an emergency tracheostomy if needed during induction of anesthesia

### Anesthetic Technique for Patients with Stridor

- Depends on experience and available facilities
- Position patient to facilitate intubation
- Techniques vary:
  - Keep patient breathing spontaneously with Sevo induction
  - Intermittent spraying of cords with 4% lignocaine
  - Examine larynx and decide on the use of muscle relaxants for intubation
  - Use of suxamethonium is preferable
  - Alternatively, preoxygenate, use propofol and suxamethonium, especially if the patient has already desaturated

## Anaesthetic Techniques

### 1. Intubation with Microlaryngeal Tube (MLT) and Inhalational or TIVA Anaesthetic

- MLTs are longer than conventional ETTs (30cm) with sizes ranging from 4-6.0 ID.
- **Advantages**:
  - Secure airway with airway protection
  - Ability to monitor airway pressures, FiO2, and ETCO2
  - Use with muscle relaxants provides good operating conditions with immobile vocal cords
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Posterior region of the larynx may be obscured by the ETT.
- TIVA or inhalational anesthesia can be used; remifentanil infusion helps blunt airway stimulation.

### 2. Techniques Without Endotracheal Tube (ETT) and TIVA

#### a) Spontaneous Ventilation with Topicalization of Airway and Sedation

- **Advantages**:
  - Rapid mobilization and discharge
  - Less potential for PONV
  - Avoidance of airway instrumentation
  - Increased likelihood of optimal voice outcome during vocal cord surgery
- Adequate topicalization of upper and lower airways takes 10-20 minutes:
  - Achieved using 2% or 4% nebulized lignocaine
  - Additional gargling of local anesthetic without swallowing may be useful
- Conscious sedation with dexmedetomidine or midazolam or ketamine, supplemented with titrations of remifentanil.
  - Capnometry with nasal specs should be used when using remifentanil.

#### b) Jet Ventilation (HFJV or LFJV) Supraglottic, Infraglottic, or Transtracheal

- **Low Frequency Jet Ventilation (LFJV)**:
  - 6-30 bpm
  - Oxygen applied by hand-triggered device (e.g., Sanders injector)
  - Gas exchange by convective ventilation or bulk flow
- **High Frequency Jet Ventilation (HFJV)**:
  - Tidal volumes smaller than dead space (1-2 ml/kg) at a frequency of 1-10 Hz.
  - Time cycled pressure-limited ventilation
  - More important mechanisms include laminar flow, Taylor-type dispersion, Pendelluft or collateral ventilation, and cardiogenic mixing.
- **Supraglottic LFJV, HFJV with TIVA**:
  - Jet nozzle located above vocal cords in the trachea.
  - Jet ventilation not possible before the suspension laryngoscope is in place or after its removal.
  - Surgeon responsible for maintaining the airway.
  - ETCO2 cannot be measured with supraglottic approach.
- **Infraglottic LFJV, HFJV**:
  - Jet nozzle located below vocal cords in trachea via thin jet catheter positioned by laryngoscopy with the tip in mid-trachea.
  - Laser-resistant double lumen tubes such as LaserJet catheter (Acutronic MS) or Hunsaker Mon-Jet catheter.
  - Hunsaker catheter prevents direct trauma to tracheal mucosa.
- **Transtracheal LFJV, HFJV with TIVA**:
  - Performed using a short, narrow (1 mm ID) catheter inserted via the cricothyroid space or space between cricoid cartilage and the first tracheal ring.
  - Purpose-made catheters include Ravussin-type catheter.
- **Equipment Necessary for Jet Ventilation**:
  - High-frequency jet ventilators such as Acutronic Monsoon III ventilator.
  - Jet ventilation catheters like Hunsaker Mon-Jet and LaserJet catheters.

##### Complications of HFJV

###### Barotrauma

- Pneumothorax
- Pneumomediastinum
- Pneumoperitoneum
- Subcutaneous emphysema
- Air trapping leading to decreased venous return, increased afterload for the right ventricle, resulting in decreased cardiac output and possible RV failure

###### Exposure to Dry Gases

- Damage to the tracheobronchial mucosa leading to:
  - Decreased mucociliary clearance
  - Infection
  - Airway plugging
  - Atelectasis
  - Necrotizing tracheobronchitis

###### Hypothermia

###### Malposition of Catheters (with Supraglottic approach)

- Gastric distension or rupture

###### Inadequate Gas Exchange

- Hypercapnia
- Hypoxaemia

#### c) Apnoeic Oxygenation with TIVA

- Recommended for pan-endoscopy.
- Patients preoxygenated for 3 minutes with 100% oxygen, anesthetized with propofol and remifentanil, paralysed with mivacurium, and hand ventilated to ET02 of >90%.
- 8 French catheter introduced into trachea using laryngoscope with the tip lying up to the carina, and flow of Oxygen 500 ml/minute administered through the catheter.
- Technique relies on aventilatory mass flow.

#### d) Intermittent Apnoea with TIVA or Inhalational Anaesthesia

- MLT being removed intermittently for short periods (<5 min) to allow surgery to take place.
- Patient under TIVA anesthesia.
- MLT reinserted if SpO2 falls below 90%.
- Laryngospasm is a major complication.
