# Dentistry Anaesthesia

## Indications for General Anaesthesia (GA)
- Extensive dental procedures unsuitable for awake patients with difficult surgical extractions.
- Small children intolerant of dental surgery under local anaesthesia.
- Allergy to local anaesthetics (rare).
- Patients with mental disabilities preventing cooperation with surgery.
- Acute inflammation rendering local anaesthetic ineffective due to local pH changes.
- Medical conditions making awake dental surgery difficult, such as extreme gag reflexes or inability to maintain adequate mouth opening.

## Premedication
- Generally not required.
- EMLA and benzodiazepines (midazolam).

## Induction
- Sevoflurane for children with basic monitors and IV line post-induction.
- Intravenous or inhalation induction for older individuals.

## Airway Management
- Coordination with the surgeon is essential.
- For small children, induction, tooth extraction, and recovery typically follow in sequence, possibly using a dental mask (Goldman/Mckesson).
- Gauze pack insertion from one buccal sulcus to the other to prevent excessive mouth breathing and aspiration of tooth fragments.
- High risk of airway loss; traditionally, patients sat upright, but now slightly head-up position is more common.
- Nasal masks are still used by some dental anaesthetists, including newer transparent neonatal masks.
- In adult dental surgery, a laryngeal mask or endotracheal intubation is necessary depending on the surgery extent:
  - Nasal intubation is preferred over oral south-facing tubes for better surgical access.

## Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)
- Anti-emetics and dexamethasone should be considered to prevent postoperative nausea, vomiting, and swelling at the surgical site.

## Recovery
- Tooth sockets may continue to bleed post-extraction, especially with infection.
- Children are best nursed flat on their side to allow head tilt-down.
- A significant number of deaths related to dental anaesthesia occur in recovery; these patients require care from experienced nurses.
- Adults should recover in a head-up position for easier airway suction and maintenance. Extubation should occur when the patient is nearly awake, after full muscle relaxation reversal, to minimize risks of airway soiling and laryngospasm due to blood presence.

## Analgesia
- Local infiltration of local anaesthetic (LA).
- Paracetamol 20 mg/kg.
- NSAIDs.
