# General

## Anatomy

- **Globe Movements**: Controlled by four rectus muscles and two oblique muscles forming an incomplete muscle cone that contains most nerves and vessels supplying the globe.
- **Sensory Innervation**: Mainly provided by the first (ophthalmic) branch of CN V. Autonomic innervation is provided by sympathetic afferents from the stellate ganglion and parasympathetic afferents from the nucleus of CN III.
- **Optic Nerve**: Enters the orbit through the optic foramen, surrounded by a meningeal sheath, increasing the risk of accidental injection into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
- **Blood Supply**: The orbit is supplied by the ophthalmic artery, a branch of the internal carotid artery, entering the orbit superomedially and closely following the course of the optic nerve.
- **Tenon's Capsule**: The facial sheath of the eyeball defining the sub-Tenon's space, a potential space, fused with the bulbar conjunctiva anteriorly.
- **Intra-Ocular Pressure (IOP)**: Normally around 10-20 mmHg. Both local and general anaesthesia can increase IOP, requiring caution in patients with elevated baseline IOP.

## Physiology

### Basic Optics

- **Light Refraction**: Parallel light rays from a distant object are refracted, inverted, and directed onto the retina.
- **Emmetropia**: Normal vision occurs when a focused image forms on the retina without glasses or contact lenses.
- **Accommodation**: When shifting gaze from distant to close objects, the ciliary muscle contracts, making the lens more rounded and increasing its refractive power.

### Common Visual Defects and Their Correction

|**Condition**|**Image Focus**|**Common Term**|**Corrective Lens**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Emmetropia|On retina|Normal vision|No correction|
|Myopia|In front of retina|Short sight. Can usually see nearby objects unaided.|Concave|
|Hyperopia|Behind retina|Long sight. Can usually see distant objects unaided.|Biconvex|
|Presbyopia|Behind retina|Old sight (near objects only)|Convex|
|Pseudophakic eyes|No accommodation|Artificial lens|Convex|

### Neural Pathways

- **Phototransduction**: Light in the visible spectrum is converted into action potentials by rod and cone cells.
- **Optic Nerve Transmission**: Action potentials are relayed to the optic nerve and pass back to the optic chiasm.
- **Optic Chiasm**: Impulses from the nasal retina decussate, while those from the temporal retina remain ipsilateral.
- **Optic Tract**: Carries impulses generated by each hemi-field to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus.
- **Visual Cortex**: The pathway continues to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe via the optic radiation.

### Visual Neural Pathway

1. **Left and Right Eye**:
	- Left Field (Left Eye)
	- Right Field (Right Eye)
2. **Pathway Details**:
	- **Retina**:
		- Short ciliary nerves
		- Ciliary ganglion
	- **Optic Nerve**:
		- From retina to optic chiasm
	- **Optic Tract**:
		- From optic chiasm to the LGN of the thalamus
	- **Lateral Geniculate Nucleus**:
		- Relay center for the visual pathway
	- **Edinger-Westphal Nuclei**:
		- Involved in pupillary reflex and lens accommodation
	- **Optic Radiation**:
		- From the LGN to the visual cortex
	- **Visual Cortex**:
		- In the occipital lobe, processes visual information

### Lesions of the Visual Pathways and Visual Field Defects

- **Optic Nerve Lesions**: Can lead to scotomas or complete blindness in the affected eye.
- **Bitemporal Hemianopia**: Loss of temporal field vision in both eyes, caused by a lesion at the optic chiasm.
- **Homonymous Hemianopia**: Loss of either right or left field vision, caused by a lesion at the optic tract, optic radiation, or visual cortex.

### Pupillary Reflexes

- **Pupillary Light Reflex**: Constriction of the pupil when exposed to bright light.
- **Consensual Light Reflex**: Constriction of the opposite pupil when one eye is exposed to bright light.
- **Neuronal Pathway**: Afferent neurons in the optic nerve travel to the lateral geniculate body, then to the midbrain. Efferent fibers from the Edinger-Westphal nuclei return via the ciliary body to cause pupillary constriction.
- **Pathway Lesions**: May result in loss of or anomalous reflexes.
# Anaesthesia for Eye Surgery

## Pre-operative Considerations
### Risk Assessment and Surgery Delays

- **Low-Risk Nature of Ophthalmic Operations**: Ophthalmic surgeries are generally considered low risk, with the risks of general anaesthesia (GA) in these procedures comparable to those associated with day-case knee arthroscopy.
- **Criteria for Postponing Surgery**: Ophthalmic procedures should only be postponed if delaying surgery improves patient outcomes through better preoperative optimization or if further urgent evaluation is necessary based on clinical history and examination.

#### Cardiovascular Considerations

- **Hypertension**: Severe hypertension (≥180/110 mmHg) may necessitate postponing elective ophthalmic surgery, especially if there is concurrent end-organ damage or related symptoms.
- **Cardiac and Other Risk Factors**: Unstable angina, hemodynamic instability, heart failure, significant shortness of breath, pallor, decreased urine output, jaundice, and malaise are examples of conditions warranting careful consideration before proceeding with surgery.

#### Glycemic Control

- **Hyperglycaemia and Hypoglycaemia**: Elective surgery should not proceed if the patient is experiencing acute hypoglycaemia (blood glucose <4.0 mmol/L with symptoms) or hyperglycaemia (blood glucose ≥17 mmol/L with signs of an acute hyperglycaemic emergency).

#### Cognitive Function and Dementia

- **Preoperative Cognitive Assessment**: Anaesthetists should distinguish between patients with varying degrees of cognitive impairment to determine the suitability of locoregional anaesthesia (LRA) versus GA. The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) is recommended for dementia assessment, with LRA being considered for patients with a GDS score of 5 or less, if agreed upon with the ophthalmologist.

### Preoperative Investigations

- **Routine Testing**: Routine preoperative tests are generally not required for lower-risk ophthalmic surgeries like cataract procedures, as they do not typically change management or improve outcomes. This is supported by strong evidence from meta-analyses and guidelines from various international bodies.
### Preoperative Fasting
- Many centres around the world have therefore moved away from the need for fasting for routine ophthalmic procedures under locoregional anaesthesia and minimal sedation.

### Multiple Co-morbidities

#### Coagulation

- **NSAIDs/Aspirin**: Generally, do not stop; may need to be stopped for eyelid procedures.

#### DVT Prophylaxis

- **Heparin**: Avoid; prefer mechanical prophylaxis.

#### Diabetes Mellitus

- **Scheduling**: Perform surgery first on the list.

#### Drugs

- **Continuation**: Continue most regular medications.

#### Premedications

- **Ranitidine**: If indicated.
- **Anxiolytics**: Administer as needed.
### Indications for General Anesthesia

- Patient preference.
- Young children.
- Uncooperative patients (e.g., learning difficulties).
- Patients unable to keep still (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, arthritis, nystagmus, tremor, cough, dyspnea, vertigo).
- Patients unable to lie flat for the duration of the operation.
- Allergy to local anesthesia.

## Anaesthetic Techniques

- **Shift Towards Locoregional Anaesthesia**: There has been a shift from GA to locoregional techniques in ophthalmic surgery, driven by improvements in efficiency, cost savings, patient safety, outcomes, and satisfaction.
- **General Anaesthesia Indications**: GA remains preferable for complex or prolonged procedures and for patients unable to cooperate, such as those with Parkinson's disease, dementia, intellectual impairments, or claustrophobia.
- **Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA)**: TIVA is gaining popularity due to smooth induction and emergence, with reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting. However, it may increase the incidence of the oculocardiac reflex during surgery.
- **Supraglottic Airway Devices**: Widely used as primary airway devices, these reduce sympathetic responses, issues at emergence, and increases in intraocular pressure (IOP). Specific devices like the LMA Classic, Ambu AuraFlex, and LMA ProSeal are noted for minimal encroachment into the surgical field.
- **Profound Neuromuscular Block**: Some practitioners prefer a profound neuromuscular block to prevent intraoperative movement, with the availability of sugammadex facilitating effective reversal and improving operating theatre efficiency.

## Regional Blocks

### Topical Anaesthesia
- **Characteristics and Usage**: Topical anaesthesia offers only surface anaesthesia without akinesia, making it suitable only for short and uncomplicated procedures, such as cataract surgery. It is particularly popular in this context. During surgery, anaesthesia can be enhanced by the surgeon using intracameral preservative-free local anaesthetic (LA).
- **Limitations**: Despite its widespread use, topical anaesthesia has limitations, primarily due to its inability to provide akinesia, which is necessary for more complex procedures.

### Needle-Based Blocks
- **Historical Context**: The traditional retrobulbar block, utilizing a 38-mm needle, has been associated with significant sightand life-threatening complications. This has led to its replacement by the peribulbar block.
- **Peribulbar Block Technique**: In modern practice, the peribulbar block involves inserting a needle parallel to the orbital floor with the eye in a neutral gaze. The recommended needle length is less than 31 mm. A volume of 5–8 ml of LA is typically used. The older "up-and-in" globe position is now avoided to reduce the risk of optic nerve injury.
- **Modern Inferotemporal Peribulbar Block**: The traditional insertion point at the junction of the medial two-thirds and lateral one-third of the inferior orbital margin poses risks due to proximity to the globe and important anatomical structures. Shifting the insertion point to the extreme inferotemporal corner, below the lateral rectus, reduces the likelihood of such complications.
- **Medial Peribulbar Block**: This block involves inserting a needle between the caruncle and the medial canthus to a depth of 10–15 mm for LA injection. It is often used to supplement an inferotemporal block but can also be the primary block in patients with long axial lengths.

### Cannula-Based (Sub-Tenon’s) Block
- **Procedure**: The sub-Tenon’s block is performed by dissecting the conjunctiva and Tenon’s capsule with forceps and blunt-tipped scissors, followed by the insertion of a blunt cannula into the sub-Tenon’s space. The inferonasal quadrant is commonly used as the access point, although other quadrants may also be utilized. Typically, 2–5 ml of LA is administered.
- **Recent Advances**: Innovations in the sub-Tenon’s block since its reintroduction in the 1990s include the use of various metal and plastic cannulae and an incisionless technique that avoids dissection. Some practitioners have employed a lacrimal dilator or a commercially available plastic probe to facilitate cannula insertion.

### Local Anaesthetic Agents and Adjuncts
- **Common Agents**: Lignocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine are commonly used LAs in ophthalmic anaesthesia, either alone or in combination. A mixture of lignocaine 2% and bupivacaine 0.5% is favored by many anaesthetists due to the rapid onset provided by lignocaine and the prolonged effect and postoperative analgesia provided by bupivacaine.
- **Hyaluronidase**: This enzyme is frequently added to LA (in doses ranging from 5–150 IU/ml) to increase membrane permeability, improve the onset and quality of the block, and reduce the required volume of LA. However, the optimal dosage remains a subject of debate.

### Practice and Popularity of Ophthalmic Blocks
- **Prevalence and Risks**: Needle-based blocks remain widely used due to their cost-effectiveness and ease of performance, requiring only a syringe and needle. However, they are associated with rare but serious complications, including brainstem anaesthesia, orbital perforation, and suprachoroidal expulsive haemorrhages. A survey involving over 55,500 blocks indicated that needle-based blocks are 2.5 times more likely to cause serious complications, a risk that persists even in specialist eye hospitals.
## Induction and Maintenance

### Airway Control

- **LMA**: Preferred due to less stimulation (reduced incidence of breath holding and spasm).
- **Intubation**: Use for obese patients, long procedures, potential airway soiling, nasal bleeding, and harvesting of mucous membrane graft material.

### Drugs

- **LMA**: Remifentanil with propofol TIVA.
- **ETT**: Remifentanil and sevoflurane with non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.

### IV Fluids

- **Consideration**: Full bladder can cause hypertension and raised IOP.

### Monitoring

- **Temperature management**: Essential.
- **BIS**: Consider using for monitoring depth of anesthesia.

### PONV Prophylaxis

- **MMA**: Check with the surgeon if opioids interfere with their operation.

## Post-operative Management

### Pain Management

- **Medications**: NSAIDs, paracetamol, sub-Tenon blocks.

### Emergency Reduction in IOP

- **Acetazolamide**: 500 mg intravenously over 5 minutes.
- **Mannitol**: 1 g/kg intravenously over 30 minutes.

### Extubation

- **Timing**: Awake or deep, avoiding straining. Remifentanil works well.

### Positioning

- **Posture**: After vitrectomy with injection of intraocular gas, the patient must posture as soon as they are conscious (usually facedown or with 'one cheek to pillow').

## Eye Sedation List

1. **Routine Monitors and Nasal Capnometry**
	
2. **1g IV Paracetamol Upfront**
	
3. **0.5mg Midazolam**
	
	- Unless very frail, observe for effect and use to inform subsequent starting doses of TCI mixture.
4. **Propofol/Rapifen TCI**
	
	- **Mixture**: 18 mL Propofol (180 mg) + 2 mL Rapifen (1 mg).
	- **Modelling**: Use Schneider effect-site modelling.
5. **Target Concentrations**
	
	- **Initial**: 0.3-0.5 ng/mL immediately.
	- **During Procedure**: Increase to 0.8-1.0 ng/mL when block is sited by surgeon.
	- **Post-Block**: Reduce back to 0.3-0.5 ng/mL.

### Aim

- Achieve very light sedation, disorienting the patient to the passage of time.

## Avoiding Excess Blinking

- **Facial Nerve Block**
- **Injection**: Just lateral to the lateral corner of the eye.

## Surgical Subspecialties Approach

### Vitreo-retinal

#### Scleral Buckle

- Pain, PONV, and oculocardiac reflex are often marked, especially in young adults.

#### Vitrectomy

- The type of gas injected depends on the required duration of action.
- Patients must posture postoperatively so the gas bubble lies over the appropriate area of the retina.
- Patients must not travel by airplane or be exposed to nitrous oxide while the gas bubble is present.

### Oculoplastics

- **Antiplatelet Drugs**: Stop 10 days prior.

### Glaucoma

- Reduction of intraocular pressure is desirable.
- Avoid ketamine and suxamethonium as they increase IOP.
- LMA insertion is preferred to minimize stimulation.

### Cataract

- Typically performed under local anesthesia.
- LMA and total intravenous anesthesia are preferred for anterior segment surgery.

## Gases Used for Retinal Tamponade

- **Air**: Remains for 2-3 days.
- **Sulfur Hexafluoride**: Remains for 2-3 weeks.
- **Octafluoropropane**: Remains for 55 days.

## Oculocardiac Reflex

### Commonly Seen In

- Squint repair, scleral buckle, retinal repair, orbital implant, evisceration, enucleation.

### Presentation

- Mediated via the trigeminal afferent and vagal efferent.
- Manifests as a slowing sinus rate, possibly irregular, with potential for sinus arrest and asystole.

### Prophylaxis and Management

- **Antimuscarinic Drugs**: Glycopyrrolate or atropine after induction.
- **Local Anesthetic Infiltration**: Around the muscles to abolish the afferent pathway.
- **Non-depolarizing Muscle Relaxants**: Reduce incidence by decreasing extraocular muscle tone.
- **Age**: Decrease in incidence with increasing age.

## Open Eye Surgery

- **Intraocular Pressure**: Same as atmospheric pressure; danger of expulsion of contents.
- **Approach**:
	- Do not attempt to empty stomach by NGT.
	- Avoid ketamine and suxamethonium.
	- Use rocuronium (1 mg/kg) with alfentanil.
	- Avoid direct pressure on the eye with the mask.
	- Allow drugs to have full effect.
	- Avoid coughing/straining.
