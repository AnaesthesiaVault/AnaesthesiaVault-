# Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)

## Introduction

- **Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) Disorders**:
  - Central sleep apnoea (Cheyne-Stokes respiration)
  - **Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)**
	- Most common
  - Mixed or complex sleep apnoea
- **OSA Definition**:
  - Airway obstruction during sleep
  - At least 5 episodes of apnoea or hypopnoea per hour
  - Each episode often associated with a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation of > 4%
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Normally, negative pressure produced by the diaphragm and intercostal muscles is counteracted by the coordinated contraction of oropharyngeal dilator and abductor muscles, keeping the airway patent.
  - Impairment of this coordination or excess soft tissue can cause obstruction during inspiration, leading to apnoea (total obstruction) or hypopnoea (partial obstruction).
  - Supine position contributes to obstruction due to:
	- Gravity pulling the tongue and soft palate down
	- Reducing the functional residual capacity (FRC) of the lungs
- **Definitions**:
  - **Apnoea**: Total airway obstruction with no airflow for 10 seconds or longer
  - **Hypopnoea**: Partial airway obstruction causing an airflow reduction of > 50% for 10 seconds or longer
  - **Severity**:
	- Mild: AHI of 5-14 episodes per hour
	- Moderate: AHI of 15-30 episodes per hour
	- Severe: AHI > 30 episodes per hour
  - **OSA Syndrome (OSAS)**: OSA with excessive daytime somnolence
	- Hypersomnolence caused by poor sleep quality, frequent arousals due to hypoxia or hypercarbia
- **Epidemiology**:
  - Prevalence of moderately severe sleep apnoea: ~5% in women and 10% in men
  - Higher prevalence in older or obese patients
  - Not all obese patients have OSA/OSAS, and not all OSA/OSAS patients are obese

## OSA Diagnosis

- **High index of suspicion required**:
  - Estimated that up to 90% of patients may be undiagnosed
- **Investigate if patient has**:
  - Excessive snoring, restless sleep, headaches, morning dry mouth and sore throat, daytime somnolence
- **Predisposing conditions**:
  - Obesity, age 40-70 years, male gender or postmenopausal women, excess alcohol intake or sedatives, smoking, pregnancy, low physical activity, unemployment, neck circumference > 40 cm, surgical patient, tonsillar/adenoidal hypertrophy (most common in children), craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disease, diabetes mellitus, nasal congestion, family history of OSA
- **Polysomnogram (PSG) Sleep Study**:
  - Gold standard diagnostic tool
  - Includes ECG, EEG, eye movements, EMG, pulse oximetry, and measurements of oro-nasal airflow and snoring volume
  - Provides exact AHI index for classification
  - Costly and not always available; reserved for severe cases
- **Home Sleep Study Units**:
  - Cheaper alternative, measures ECG, SpO2, respiration rate, and snoring volume
  - Screening questionnaires are more routinely used perioperatively
- **Screening Questionnaires**:
  - Berlin, ASA, and STOP questionnaires
  - STOP-BANG adds sensitivity for moderate to severe OSA

### STOP-BANG Questionnaire (Chung Et Al., 2008)

| **STOP**                        |                                                        |        |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| **S (snore)**                   | Do you snore loudly (louder than talking or heard through closed doors)? | Yes/No |
| **T (tired)**                   | Do you often feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during daytime? | Yes/No |
| **O (observed)**                | Has anyone observed you stop breathing during sleep?   | Yes/No |
| **P (blood pressure)**          | Do you have or are you being treated for high blood pressure? | Yes/No |
| **BANG**                        |                                                        |        |
| **B (BMI)**                     | BMI > 35 kg/m²?                                        | Yes/No |
| **A (age)**                     | Age > 50 years?                                        | Yes/No |
| **N (neck circumference)**      | Neck circumference > 40 cm?                            | Yes/No |
| **G (gender)**                  | Gender male?                                           | Yes/No |

## OSA Consequences

- **Respiratory**:
  - Chronic intermittent hypoxia and hypercarbia
  - Pulmonary hypertension
- **Cardiovascular**:
  - Hypertension, dysrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, biventricular dysfunction, congestive cardiac failure, myocardial infarction
- **Neuro-cognitive**:
  - Depression, decreased IQ, memory loss, increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents
- **Endocrine**:
  - Metabolic syndrome, prediabetes or diabetes, disturbed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response with ↑ ACTH & Cortisol levels, testicular & ovarian dysfunction, hypothyroidism

## OSA Treatment Options

- **Playing the Didgeridoo**:
  - Strengthens upper airway muscles, improves mild to moderate OSA
- **Lifestyle Changes**:
  - Weight loss, smoking cessation, limit alcohol/sedative intake, sleep on the side
- **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)**:
  - Reduces risk of hypertension, stroke, and other cardiac complications
  - Pressure of 5-20 cm H2O
  - Effective in non-obese patients and severe OSA
  - Nasal mask (nCPAP) more effective than full face mask
- **Mandibular Responding Splint (MRS)**:
  - Worn over teeth, holds mandible and tongue forward
- **Surgery**:
  - Indicated for deviated nasal septum, enlarged tonsils/adenoids, receding mandible, bariatric surgery
  - Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty rarely recommended
- **Soft Palate Implants**:
  - Inserted under local anaesthetic to stiffen soft palate, reduce vibration

## Anaesthetic Considerations

### Pre-operative

- Delay elective surgery if possible for CPAP for 3 months in patients with CCF or hypercapnoea (PaCO2 > 6.5 kPa)
- CPAP for as little as 4 hours preoperatively may be beneficial
- Prescribe anxiolytic premed with caution or omit
- α2-agonist (Clonidine, Dexmedetomidine) premedication may reduce intraoperative anaesthetic requirements and have an opioid-sparing effect

### Intra-operative

- Regional anaesthesia preferred with multimodal analgesia (NSAIDs, Paracetamol, Tramadol, Ketamine, Dexamethasone) and short-acting opioids
- If GA performed, intubation and mechanical ventilation recommended
- Use short-acting agents, minimize opioid use
- OSA patients have an 8-times higher incidence of difficult intubation
- Position patient in "sniffing" position, "ramped-up" with pillows

### Post-operative

- Increased rate of complications, mostly on first day but up to days 4 or 5
- Respiratory complications: aspiration pneumonia, ARDS, need for re-intubation and post-op ventilation
- Monitor with pulse oximetry until room-air SpO2 > 90% during sleep
- Continue CPAP during hospitalization for those already using it
- Extubate fully awake after fully reversing muscle relaxant
- Position semi-upright for extubation and recovery
- Use supplemental oxygen with caution

### Conscious Sedation

- No increased periprocedural risk in several studies

### Ambulatory Surgery

- Severe OSA patients should not be offered ambulatory surgery
- Mild OSA patients may be offered ambulatory surgery for minimally invasive or superficial procedures, with extended monitoring

### Considerations for Children with OSA

- Mostly occurs in age group 2-6 years
- Adenotonsillectomy is most common and effective treatment
- Severe desaturations during sleep common
- Sedative premed usually omitted or reduced
- High incidence of airway obstruction post-op
- Overnight hospitalization required following adenotonsillectomy
- Chronic hypoxemia may result in upregulation of opioid receptors, making children more sensitive to opioids

### Postpone Surgery for Sleep Study?

- No, inconsistent results regarding the benefits of pre-operative use of CPAP
- Polysomnography is expensive and difficult to access
- Treat patient as if they have OSA, use CPAP if indicated post-op
