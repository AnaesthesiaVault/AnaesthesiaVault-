# Shared Airway in Anaesthesia

## Introduction
- Anaesthesia for shared airway procedures requires high cooperation between the anaesthetist and the surgeon.
- These procedures range from endoscopic airway examinations to complex microsurgeries and laser surgeries.
- There is no universally accepted anaesthetic technique; the choice depends on:
  - The anaesthetist's experience
  - Available equipment
- Many devices for shared airway management are institution-specific.
- Practitioners must be aware of the potential complications associated with each ventilation technique.

## Goals and Responsibilities

### Anaesthetist
- Ensure a safe and patent airway
- Maintain adequate oxygenation and CO₂ removal
- Prevent airway soiling

### Surgeon
- Ensure adequate surgical access and a clear view
- Maintain a relatively or completely motionless surgical field when necessary

## Types of Shared Airway

### Partially Shared Airway
- ENT surgeries (major/minor ear surgeries, nasal surgeries)
- Ophthalmic surgeries
- Head/neck plastic surgeries

### Fully Shared Airway
- Oropharyngeal surgeries:
  - Dental/maxillofacial surgeries
  - ENT (e.g., adenotonsillectomy)
  - Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
- Airway surgeries:
  - Direct laryngoscopy
  - Bronchoscopy (fibreoptic or rigid)
  - Tracheostomy
  - Endotracheal surgeries
  - Tracheal resection and reconstruction
  - Airway trauma
  - Foreign body removal

## General Considerations for Airway Surgery

- **Population**:
  - **Elderly**: Often have coexisting respiratory and cardiovascular morbidities from smoking and alcohol intake; may have malignant lesions and radiotherapy side effects.
  - **Young children or those with learning difficulties**: Often present with inhaled/ingested foreign objects.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Assess the location, size, extent, and mobility of lesions
  - Investigate effects on airway patency and laryngeal function
  - Review previous anaesthetic and surgical findings, cross-sectional imaging
- **Psychosocial Factors**:
  - Fear of choking death and inability to communicate post-tracheostomy
  - Frequent return for multiple procedures
- **Physical Protection**:
  - Protect eyes, neck, and teeth while optimizing surgical access

## Anaesthetic Techniques for the Shared Airway

### Airway Management Techniques

#### Intubation Techniques
- **Standard Tube**: Large, cuffed tube
  - Issues: Surgeon may struggle to work around it; tube compression
- **Small Tube**: Small (4–5 mm internal diameter) microlaryngoscopy tube
  - Issues: May obscure lesions in post commissure area; increased airway resistance in longer cases
- **Laser Tube**: See section on laser airway surgery

#### Non-Intubation Techniques
- **Laryngeal Mask**: Used under general anaesthesia with fibre optic guidance
  - Good for vocal cord biopsy, injection, and diagnostic bronchoscopy
- **Intermittent Apnoea**: Hyperventilate with 100% O₂, remove ETT for clear surgical field, then reinsert and hyperventilate
- **Insufflation/Spontaneous Respiration**: Insufflate volatile anaesthetic to spontaneously breathing patient
  - Advantages: Laser safe, unobstructed field
  - Issues: Lack of airway control, potential airway fires, gastric insufflations

### Jet Ventilation Techniques

#### Jet Ventilation Site
- **Supraglottic**
- **Subglottic**
- **Transtracheal**

#### Jet Frequency
- **Low Frequency Jet Ventilation (LFJV)**: <60 breaths/min
- **High Frequency Jet Ventilation (HFJV)**: >60 breaths/min
  - **HFJV Types**: HFPPV, HFO

#### Jet Ventilation History
- First described by Sanders in 1967
- Developed as a modality in the 1970s
- Defined by frequency or jet site

### Anaesthetic Agents for Airway Surgery
- **Local Anaesthetics**: Topical anaesthesia with 2% IVI Lignocaine, up to 4mg/kg
- **Volatiles**: Sevoflurane (pleasant smell, non-irritating, suitable for inhalational induction)
- **Intravenous Agents**:
  - Propofol (no active metabolites, ideal for TIVA/TCI)
  - Remifentanil (ultra-short acting, ideal for TIVA/TCI)
  - B adrenergic blockade (e.g., Esmolol)

### Muscle Relaxants
- No ideal short-acting non-depolarizing agent
- Options include:
  - Mivacurium, Rapacuronium (short-acting but not profound blockade)
  - Rocuronium, Vecuronium
  - Succinylcholine infusion (unpredictable blockade)

## Laser Surgery of the Airway

### CO₂ Laser
- Used for precise surgical cutting, coagulation, sealing with minimal postoperative oedema
- **Neodymium-YAG Laser**: Higher risk of tube ignition

### Hazards
- **Operating Theatre Staff**: Risk from laser radiation, necessitates formal safety programs and eye protection
- **Patient**: Risk from misdirected laser radiation and laser-induced airway fire

### Laser Tubes
- **Norton Laser Tube**: All-metal, non-flammable
- Other tubes include:
  - Sheridan Laser-trach tube
  - Mallinckrodt Laser-flex tracheal tube
  - Xomed Laser-Shield II

### Airway Fire Management

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Remove fuel and oxidant source
  - Disconnect anaesthetic circuit, flood field with saline/water, remove burning tracheal tube
- **Subsequent Actions**:
  - Oxygenate patient by bag and mask with 100% O₂
  - Assess damage via fibreoptic bronchoscopy
  - Manage significant damage with steroids, antibiotics, and ventilator support in ICU

## Use of the Laryngeal Mask Airway in “The Shared Airway”

### History and Design
- **LMA Flexible**:
  - First described by Alexander in 1990.
  - Commercially available in 1992.
  - Designed for head, neck, and upper body surgeries where the LMA Classic tube would interfere with the surgical field or be occluded.

### Structure
- **Components**:
  - **Cuff**: Identical to the LMA Classic.
  - **Wire-reinforced Airway Tube**:
	- Narrower, longer, and provides more flexibility and resistance to compression.
	- Flexibility allows for patient or shaft movement without cuff displacement.
	- Extra length enables the breathing circuit to be attached further from the face.
  - **Cuff Inflation Line**: Essential for advanced use, requiring familiarity by both anaesthetist and surgeon.

### Usage
- **Indications**:
  - Dental procedures
  - Palatal surgery
  - Adenotonsillectomy

### Advantages
- Superior airway recovery profile, especially beneficial in children.
- Fewer episodes of bronchospasm, laryngospasm, desaturation, and bleeding.
- Improved protection from tracheobronchial tree soiling compared to an uncuffed endotracheal tube.

### Challenges
- Airway obstruction and hypoxia more common with LMA Flexible than with endotracheal tube during maintenance of anaesthesia.
  - Often due to misapplication of the Boyle-Davis gag or laryngospasm.
  - Complication incidence depends on the surgeon's and anaesthetist's experience.

## Specific Procedures

### Two “Recipes” for Direct Laryngoscopy

#### Spontaneous Ventilation and Insufflation Technique
- **Preparation**:
  - Start a background infusion of Remifentanyl (0.05-0.1 µg/kg/min) during preoxygenation and monitor placement.
- **Induction**:
  - Propofol (2 mg/kg).
  - Laryngoscopy with liberal topical lignocaine (2% IV formulation, up to 4 mg/kg) application.
  - Optional: Volatile Sevoflurane 8% if tolerated.
- **Maintenance**:
  - Ensure deep anaesthesia and spontaneous breathing before airway handover to the surgeon.
  - Surgeon inserts and positions the suspension laryngoscope.
  - Attach anaesthetic circuit to the side arm of the laryngoscope or use a nasopharyngeal airway for O2 and gas insufflation.
  - Patient breathes 100% O2 (reduce concentration if laser used).
  - TIVA propofol as intermittent boluses or infusion (0.5–1 ml/kg/hr).
  - Analgesia: Perfalgan 1g, Fentanyl 1-2 µg/kg, NSAIDs.
  - Dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg for airway oedema and anti-emetic effect.

#### Subglottic Jet Ventilation Technique with the Manujet and Benjamin Tube
- **Preparation**:
  - Check and assemble the Manujet.
  - Connect to wall O2 (4 kPa) and set desired driving pressure.
  - Connect to the Benjamin Tube and ensure all equipment is functioning.
  - Preoxygenation, monitors, IV line.
- **Induction**:
  - Remifentanyl 0.5 µg/kg/min.
  - Propofol 2 mg/kg bolus and infusion of 1 ml/kg/hr.
  - Mivacurium 0.15 mg/kg.
  - Mask ventilation for 2-3 minutes.
- **Airway Securing**:
  - Normal laryngoscopy and intubation with the Benjamin Tube (+introducer).
  - Remove introducer and attach Manujet to the Benjamin Tube’s main port.
  - Attach capnograph tubing to the side port.
  - Test inflation and adjust driving pressure.
  - Secure the Benjamin Tube on the left side of the patient's mouth.
- **Maintenance**:
  - Propofol 0.5–0.75 ml/kg/hr.
  - Remifentanyl 0.25–0.4 µg/kg/min.
  - Hand ventilate at 10–12 breaths/min, ensuring adequate expiration.
  - Surgeon sets up the operating laryngoscope and sprays topical lignocaine on vocal cords.
  - Close liaison with the surgeon required; periods of apnoea may be necessary.
  - Additional Mivacurium doses (0.1 mg/kg, lasting 6–7 minutes) as needed.
  - Post-op analgesics and antiemetics (Ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg, Dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg).
  - At the end of surgery, remove the Benjamin Tube and place an LMA for awakening.

**Time to awakening and breathing**:
- Propofol: <10 minutes.
- Remifentanyl: <5 minutes.
