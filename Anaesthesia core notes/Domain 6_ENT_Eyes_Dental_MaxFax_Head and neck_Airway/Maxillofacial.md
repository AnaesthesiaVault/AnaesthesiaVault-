# Head and Neck Infection

## Common Infections
- Ludwig’s angina
- Peritonsillar abscess
- Submandibular abscess

### Source and Spread
- Most frequent source of infection: dental abscess.
- Commonly involved spaces:
  - Buccal
  - Submandibular
  - Sublingual
- **Main airway problem:** Trismus (limited mouth opening).

### Airway Management
- Awake nasal fibreoptic intubation may be necessary for limited mouth opening.
- **Potential for airway obstruction:**
  - Spread of infection into the parapharyngeal space.
  - Ludwig’s angina can cause airway obstruction due to tongue elevation. Inability to protrude the tongue is a sensitive indicator.

### Imaging and Intraoperative Management
- Review imaging and flexible nasendoscopy results.
- If severe airway obstruction or failed AFOI, awake tracheostomy under local may be required.
  - Surgeons should infiltrate with local anesthesia and adrenaline and prepare the neck prior to AFOI attempt.
  - Emergency tracheostomy is technically more challenging with anterior neck swelling.
- **Postoperative considerations:**
  - Delayed extubation in ICU or elective tracheostomy if laryngeal swelling is noted.
  - Perform cuff leak test to exclude significant airway swelling.

### Pulmonary Aspiration Risk
- Spontaneous or iatrogenic rupture of the abscess can cause pulmonary aspiration.
  - Extra care with airway instrumentation.

### Severe Cases
- Pre-maxillary spread can lead to orbital cellulitis and cavernous sinus thrombosis.
- Mediastinitis or systemic sepsis can occur with high mortality in severe cases.

# Head and Neck Cancer

## General Considerations
- Usually squamous cell carcinomas that metastasize to lymph nodes in the neck.
- Oral cancers are associated with smoking and alcohol excess, often with cardiorespiratory comorbidities and malnutrition due to chronic dysphagia.

### Airway Difficulty
- Can arise due to tumor distortion or radiotherapy.
- Complex reconstructive surgery can alter anatomy, creating a difficult airway.
- **Preoperative assessment:** Focus on identifying any airway obstruction. Nasendoscopy is crucial in guiding airway management for non-critical airway obstruction.

## Airway Techniques
- **General anesthesia:**
  - Good visualization of the larynx on nasendoscopy suggests safe to proceed to GA.
  - Nasendoscopic view does not always correlate with direct laryngoscopy view.
- **CICO Scenario:**
  - Induction in theatre.
  - High-flow nasal oxygen for pre-oxygenation and apnoeic oxygenation during intubation attempts.
  - Surgeons must be prepared for emergency tracheostomy.
  - Surgical cricothyroidotomy for faster front-of-neck access if patient is in danger of hypoxia.
  - Jet ventilation as standby, with trans-tracheal jetting requiring preemptive placement of a cricothyroid cannula.
  - Awake videolaryngoscopy: Topicalization of oropharynx with local anesthesia and conscious sedation.
  - Awake fibreoptic intubation (AFOI): Suitable for difficult intubation scenarios, but hazardous in patients with stridor or tumors near the larynx.
  - Awake tracheostomy under local anesthesia is the safest option in severe airway obstruction.

# Reconstructive Surgery

## Techniques
- Advanced reconstructive techniques for head and neck cancer surgery.
- **Excision of primary tumor with neck dissection:**
  - Local flaps
  - Vascular pedicle flaps
  - Free flaps

## Considerations
- Potential difficult airway and probable requirement for tracheostomy.
  - Best inserted at the start of surgery.
- **Controlled hypotension:** Remifentanil infusion during tumor resection to reduce blood loss and improve the surgical field.
- **Change of patient position:** Intraoperatively to allow surgical access to harvest free flap.
- **Post-free flap anastomosis:** Optimize perfusion to tissue graft:
  - Maintain adequate arterial pressure.
  - Fluid management to optimize flap perfusion:
	- Goal-directed fluid therapy.
	- Zero balance approach.
- **Consensus on blood transfusion:** Restrictive policy with a transfusion trigger of 7 g/dl.
- **Temperature control:** Vital to avoid hypothermia and shivering, which can decrease free flap blood flow.

## Postoperative Care
- **Flap monitoring:** Hourly for the first 48 hours.
  - Clinical observation of color, capillary refill, and surface temperature.
- **ERAS protocol:**
  - Minimize preoperative fasting.
  - Preoperative carbohydrate loading.
  - Early postoperative nutrition.
  - Pulmonary physiotherapy.
  - Early tracheostomy decannulation.
  - Postoperative mobilization.
  - Removal of urinary catheters.

# Craniofacial Surgery

## Procedures
- Includes cleft lip and palate repair, TMJ and orthognathic procedures.
- **TMJ surgery:** For painful locking or arthritic degeneration.
- **Orthognathic surgery:** For facial asymmetry, deformity, or dental malocclusion.
  - Le Fort I osteotomy (maxilla repositioning).
  - Sagittal split osteotomy (mandible repositioning).
  - Bimaxillary osteotomy (combined maxillary and mandibular surgery).

## Specific Considerations
- **Nasal intubation:** Preferred in orthognathic surgery for dental occlusion assessment.
- **Submental intubation:** Required if nasal route is difficult or for upper facial access.
  - ETT is passed through a surgical incision in the floor of the mouth to submental skin.
- **Bleeding:** Extensive bleeding from maxilla; reduce by positioning patient head-up, using adrenaline-containing local anesthetic, and controlled hypotension with remifentanil infusion.
- **Prophylaxis and Analgesia:** Antibiotic prophylaxis, multimodal analgesia, PONV prophylaxis, corticosteroids for swelling.
