# Airway Rescue

## New Trends

### Algorithms for Airway Rescue

- DAS and Vortex guidelines (see link for openairway).
- Updated roughly every 5 years.
- SASA’s most recent version published 2014.

### Significant Trends in Recent Guidelines

- Early use of video laryngoscopes where suitable skill exists.
- Include use of VL as initial plan in anticipated difficulty.
- Emphasis on supraglottic airways (SGA) and rescue devices in failed intubation.
- SGA for cardiac resuscitation to minimize interruptions of chest compressions.
- Transition from CICV (can’t intubate, can’t ventilate) to the more focused CICO (can’t intubate, can’t oxygenate).
- Plan multiple strategies (Plan A, B, and C) before commencing airway management.
- Increasing development of cognitive aids for airway emergencies.
- The Vortex approach, which promotes the progression through three main non-surgical options (mask, supraglottic, and endotracheal tube).

### Plans for Airway Management

#### Plan A: Intubation

- **If CTM impalpable, consider**:
	- Ultrasound scan front of neck / discuss with surgeons
	- Awake fiberoptic intubation
- **Procedure**:
	- **Position**: Patient positioned for intubation
	- **Preoxygenation**: Administer preoxygenation
	- **ET CO2**: Confirm with ET CO2
	- **NMB**: Administer appropriate NMB dose & monitoring
	- **Tools**: Use video/alternative laryngoscope, bougie or stylet, and external laryngeal manipulation (ELM)
	- **Techniques**: Relax cricoid, rotate ETT if hold up

#### Plan B: Oxygenation via SAD

- **Declare failed intubation**: Call for help
- **Procedure**:
	- **SAD**: Insert 2nd generation SAD (removal of cricoid to insert)
	- **Outcome**:
		- **Success**: Keep SAD, continue anesthesia, and proceed with surgery
		- **Failure**: Move to Plan C (Facemask ventilation)

#### Plan C: Facemask Ventilation

- **Declare failed SAD**: Postpone surgery
- **Procedure**:
	- **Technique**: Two-person technique
	- **Outcome**:
		- **Success**: Wake patient up, reverse NMB (consider Sugammadex)
		- **Failure**: Move to Plan D (Scalpel, bougie, tube)

#### Plan D: Scalpel, Bougie, Tube

- **Procedure**:
	- **Ensure paralysis**: Confirm adequate paralysis
	- **Techniques**:
		- **Incision**: Transverse stab incision, rotate scalpel 90°, insert bougie, thread ETT (size 6.0)

### Paediatric Airway

- Recent studies show the traditional understanding of the round, ‘funnel-shaped’ airway based on cadaveric research was mistaken.
- Measurements from video bronchoscopy and MRIs demonstrate the glottis to be the narrowest section.
- Cricoid is elliptical, not circular.
- Hence, increased motivation for cuffed ETT in children: high volume, low pressure design (HVLP).
- Cricoid cartilage ring cannot expandmost common site of post-intubation tissue ischemia and fibrosis.
- Cuffed tubes ½ size smaller than uncuffed ETT (age/4 + 3.5).
- Leak elicited with cuff deflated (with pressure no more than 20 cm H₂O).
- Keep cuff pressure <20 cm H₂O.

### Simulation Training

- Increasingly common.
- Recent systematic review found simulation training at least as good as other forms of instruction, with greater participant enjoyment and satisfaction.
- Data not yet conclusive that this leads to enhanced patient safety.

## Pre-oxygenation and Oxygen Delivery: NODESAT, ApOx, and THRIVE

Focus on effective preoxygenation in critically ill patients and prevention of desaturation during airway interventions (emergency intubation).

- **Higher risk than those undergoing elective surgery due to**:
	- Lung pathologies
	- Decreased level of consciousness
	- Reduced innate airway protection
	- Increased metabolic demands
	- Reduced oxygen-carrying capacity
	- Decreased respiratory drive as they near decompensation

### Strategies to Increase Effective Pre-oxygenation and Decrease Rate of Desaturation (NODESAT Philosophy)

- Pre-oxygenation with CPAP or assisted ventilation to increase airway pressure:
	- Use BVM (bag-valve-mask-reservoir) with a PEEP valve
	- Manually assist ventilation on a circle system
	- Use NIV by face-mask (pressure support mode on ICU and anesthesia ventilators)
	- Nasal cannula oxygen (especially high-flow systems)
- Apnoeic oxygenation (ApOx):
	- Achieved by use of high-flow nasal cannula (THRIVE systemTransnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange)
	- Normal nasal cannulae at flow rates of 10-15 L/min effective and well tolerated
	- Also used in pediatrics at risk of desaturation
	- Laryngoscope modified to deliver oxygen is also an option
- Delayed Sequence Intubation (DSI):
	- Patient who is delirious/combative due to medical condition or hypoxia and challenging to preoxygenate
	- Dissociative dose of ketamine used to optimize compliance without causing apneasedation technique to improve pre-oxygenation
	- One prospective but observational trial showed improved oxygenation

## Approach to Difficult Airway

1. **How to preoxygenate**:
	- Consider HFNP, NODESAT (nasal oxygenation during efforts securing a tube) or transtracheal cannulation and oxygenation
	- Position of comfort
2. **Can I face mask ventilate?**
	- This may be difficult with a narrow laryngeal inlet, dysmorphic features, or large tongues.
	- If unable to: move straight to the next stage.
3. **Can I see the cords?**
	- Optimize the view with muscle relaxants. Note that Sux often wears off too quickly.
	- Sugammadex can be used but often takes time to draw up or workmay need to go for FONA.
4. **Can I intubate?**
	- Look at preoperative imaging and diameter of the airway. If unable to intubate, an awake tracheostomy is the fallback.
5. **Is FONA difficult?**
	- Mark landmarks and consider infiltrating with adrenaline and bupivacaine prior to induction.
	- Designate someone to do the FONA procedure (if necessary).

## Laryngoscopes

- Greatest area of development of new airway rescue tools has been indirect laryngoscopy. 13 manufacturers exist:
	- Glidescope—various iterations (original, GVL, AVL, Ranger, Cobalt, Titanium)
	- Storz C-MAC—numerous blades available (MAC 2-4, MIL 0-2, D-blade)
	- McGrath—Series 5, McGrath MAC with multiple blades
	- King Vision—disposable ducted and plain blades
	- AirTraq—Optical laryngoscope now offering a video attachment
	- TrueView—Optical laryngoscope which has a camera attachment
	- Pentax AWS ducted VL with disposable blades
	- Intubrite VLS—VL with LEDs designed to cause fluorescence of the vocal cords
	- VividTrac VL—'Plug&Play' disposable USB VL, not yet supported in SA
	- CoPilot VL—Not yet supported in SA
	- AP Advance VL—Not yet supported in SA
	- Coopdech VLP—Not yet supported in SA
	- Anatech Disposable VL—Not yet supported in SA
	- Numerous other rather dubious copies and untested devices are available online...
- Recent devices in SA: King Vision, McGrath MAC, and Intubrite VL.
- Glidescope, CMAC, and AirTraq have the best depth of literature describing their use.
- Blades are either traditional deeply curved/hyper-angulated or feature a tube guide channel/duct and close to 90-degree bendmay require introducer, bougie, or forceps.
### Video Laryngoscopes

	- **Examples**: Storz C-MAC, Glidescope Direct, TrueView, Intubrite VL
	- **Insertion**: In line with subsequent tongue sweep
	- **Ideal Uses**: Routine VL use, difficult anatomy
	- **Strengths**: Short learning curve
	- **Weaknesses**: Least advantage from view
- **Hyper-angulated**:
	
	- **Examples**: Glidescope AVL, Glidescope Titanium, C-MAC D blade
	- **Insertion**: Midline with flange
	- **Ideal Uses**: Anticipated difficulty, failed DL

	- **Weaknesses**: Greatest skill required
- **Channelled/Ducted**:
	
	- **Examples**: Pentax AWS, AirTraq, King Vision
	- **Insertion**: Midline
	- **Ideal Uses**: C-spine injury, novice users
	- **Strengths**: Easiest coordination
	- **Weaknesses**: Awkward insertion

## Supraglottic Airways

- Provides effective ventilation in 94% of CICO events.

### Second Generation Devices

- Provides mechanism for gastric drainage, recommended for airway rescue.
- **LMA-ProSeal**: Gold standard.
- **I-Gel, 3gLM, and Air-Q Intubating Laryngeal Airway (ILA)**: Offer additional benefits.

### Features of the "Perfect" SGA (Device Does not yet exist)

- Can be inserted with minimal training.
- Protects against aspiration.
- Serves as an effective conduit for the placement of an endotracheal tube.
- Cheap and disposable.
- Effective in all patients.

### LMA-Fastrach (Intubating LMA)

- Silicone wire-reinforced.
- Reliable intubation in patients with difficult airways.
- Current gold standard for blind intubation through an SGA.
- Does not protect against aspiration.

### Fibre-Optic Intubation through SGAs

- Can be achieved through many SGAs.
- Advised to use modern/cheaper devices: I-Gel, AirQ, and 3gLM, which allow an adequate diameter ETT to be inserted.
- May require an intermediate step such as the use of an Aintree catheter.

### Intubating LMAs

- Equipped with video capabilities.
- **LMA-CTrach**: First device, withdrawn from the market.
- **TotalTrack VLM**: Introduced with success rates and efficacy rivalling ILMA and CTrach.
	- Features a disposable intubating laryngeal mask coupled with a reusable video camera and display.
	- South African clinical trial shows high success rates and efficacy.

### Third Generation LMAs

- Not yet in regular clinical use.
- **Elisha, Baska, and 3gLM**:
	- Designed to facilitate blind intubation.
	- Allow gastric drainage.
	- Have a "self-energising" seal, where the delivery of positive pressure ventilation causes a dynamic increase in sealing pressure.

## Surgical Airways

### NAP 4 Findings

- Majority of surgical access to the airway performed by anaesthetists was via cricothyroidotomy.
	- Failed in 65% of attempts.
	- Majority of failed attempts were needle cricothyroidotomy.
- Surgical cricothyroidotomy success rate was much higher.
	- Large portion performed by surgeons already in the operating theatre.

### Recommended Technique

- Surgical airway access should be performed with bimanual tactile "scalpel, finger, bougie" technique.
	- Access to trachea confirmed by palpation with little finger.
	- Then a bougie is inserted.
	- Thereafter, an ETT is inserted.

# Cricoid Pressure

## Rapid Sequence Induction

- Designed to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents in patients at increased risk of such an event.
  - Induction of anaesthesia leads to loss of protective airway reflexes.
  - Aspiration risk exists in the interval between loss of consciousness and inflation of the endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff.
  - One component of RSI is cricoid pressure, which has become controversial recently.

## Cricoid Pressure

Described by Sellick in 1961:

- Cricoid cartilage pressed backward by an assistant using thumb and index finger, against underlying cervical vertebrae.
- Occludes the lumen of the oesophagus to prevent regurgitation of stomach contents into the pharynx.
- Initial observations were made using a cadaver model, then Sellick attempted the manoeuvre during induction in 26 patients at high risk of aspiration.
  - None of these patients experienced regurgitation or vomiting when cricoid pressure was applied.
  - Three patients had immediate reflux on release of cricoid pressure after tracheal intubation.
- Sellick also confirmed the value of cricoid pressure in preventing saline that was run into the oesophagus from a height of 100 cm H₂O from reaching the pharynx in a patient undergoing gastro-oesophagectomy.
- In his report, Sellick described “firm” pressure but did not specify the force needed to occlude the oesophagus.
  - Further cadaver and patient studies determined the force required:
	- When the patient is awake: 10 Newtons (1 kg).
	- When the patient has lost consciousness: 30 N (3 kg).
  - Excessive force might limit laryngeal visualization.
  - Inadequate force results in incomplete oesophageal occlusion.
- Release cricoid pressure immediately if vomiting occurs to avoid oesophageal rupture.
- Sellick initially described the application of cricoid pressure with:
  - Head down.
  - Head and neck in extreme extension to tether the oesophagus against the cervical vertebrae.
  - Later amended position to “slightly extended.”

## Arguments Against Cricoid Pressure

- **Obstructs Laryngoscopy**:
  - May obstruct view of the glottis.
  - May increase the difficulty of SGA insertion, fibreoptic intubation, and mask ventilation.
  - Evidence in literature and case reports is contradictory: some report increased time to intubation, which increases the risk of pulmonary aspiration. Others show no difference.
  - A meta-analysis of LMA studies by Brimacombe found that cricoid pressure reduced successful insertion of LMAs from 94% to 67% and impeded tracheal intubation via LMA.
- **Reduces Lower Oesophageal Sphincter (LOS) Tone**:
  - Pressure of 20 Newtons in awake volunteers decreased LOS tone from 24 to 15 mmHg and further to 12 mmHg if force increased to 40 N.
  - Restoration to baseline when pressure is released.
  - Prophylactic administration of metoclopramide did not prevent cricoid pressure-induced reduction in LOS tone.
  - A similar study showed no increase in gastro-oesophageal reflux with cricoid pressure.
- **Incorrect Anatomical Basis**:
  - Disputed in CT and MRI scans which demonstrated that the oesophagus is located lateral to the midline in ~50% of patients (n=51).
  - Cricoid pressure further displaces the oesophagus laterally in 90% of patients—left in 69% and right in 21% of patients.
  - Posterior pressure generated by this maneuver is unevenly distributed: when the oesophagus is in the lateral position (or moved there by cricoid pressure), the lumen is compressed against the longus colli muscle and would receive less force than if it were being compressed against the bony vertebral body.
- **Incorrectly Performed**:
  - Clinicians and assistants are not routinely trained to standardize the technique.
  - Common errors include:
	- Applying pressure to the thyroid cartilage.
	- Using the technique inappropriately and inconsistently.
	- Removing cricoid pressure too early (before the airway has been definitively secured) or too late (after the intubator has requested it to be removed to facilitate intubation if the glottic view has been obscured).
- **May Cause Injury**:
  - May aggravate unstable C-spine injuries by causing movement at the fracture-dislocation site.
  - A cadaver study demonstrated distraction, angulation, and translation of the injured C-spine when cricoid pressure was applied.

## Support for Cricoid Pressure

- **Cadaver Studies**:
  - Cricoid pressure prevents regurgitation of stomach contents (in this case, saline) into the pharynx at oesophageal pressures up to 50 cm H₂O.
  - In vivo, intragastric pressures rarely exceed 34 cm H₂O (~25 mmHg), hence 30 N force is more than adequate to prevent regurgitation.
- Prevents gastric insufflation during mask ventilation in adults and children—up to 40 cm H₂O.
- Cricoid pressure of 30 N occludes the oesophagus: demonstrated by failure to pass NG-tubes of different sizes (12 and 20F, 6.7 mm and 4 mm) into the oesophagus. An MRI study supported this finding.
- Clinicians were able to reproduce a pressure of 30 N and retain this knowledge after 3 months with simple, non-time-consuming training.
- Case reports have documented regurgitation after the release of cricoid pressure.

## Conclusion

- Effective at reducing but not eliminating the risk of aspiration.
- The application of cricoid pressure is not harmful and may be beneficial to some patients: a study to confirm its efficacy is not feasible. It is likely not ethical either as the control group at risk for aspiration would be denied the technique.
# Difficult Mask Ventilation

## Definition of Difficult Mask Ventilation

- **Various Definitions Over the Years**:
  - Subjective topic: difficult MV for trainee may differ from difficult MV for consultant.
  - American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) defines difficult MV as: “it is not possible for the anesthesiologist to provide adequate ventilation because of one or more of the following problems: inadequate mask seal, excessive gas leak, or excessive resistance to the ingress or egress of gas.”
  
### Signs of Inadequate Ventilation

- Absent or inadequate chest movement
- Absent or inadequate breath sounds
- Auscultatory signs of severe obstruction
- Cyanosis
- Gastric air entry or dilatation
- Decreasing or inadequate oxygen saturation
- Absent or inadequate exhaled carbon dioxide
- Absent or inadequate spirometric measures of exhaled gas flow
- Hemodynamic changes

### Additional Criteria from Various Studies

- **Langeron et al. (2000)**:
  - Inability to maintain saturation above 92%
  - Using the oxygen flush more than twice
  - Requiring two operators or a change of operator
- **Yildiz et al. (2005)**:
  - Difficulty depends on airway maneuvers used
- **Kheterpal et al. (2006)**:
  - Inadequate MV
  - MV requiring two operators

### Han Et Al. Classification of Mask Ventilation

- **Grade 0**: Ventilation not attempted
- **Grade 1**: Ventilated by mask
- **Grade 2**: Ventilated with oral airway or adjunct
- **Grade 3**: Difficult MV (inadequate/unstable, two-person technique)
- **Grade 4**: Unable to mask ventilate

## Incidence of Difficult Mask Ventilation

- Ranges from 0.08% to 15% due to lack of consensus in definition.
  - Difficult MV: 1.4%
  - Impossible MV: 0.15%

### Independent Predictors of Risk

- Neck radiation:
  - Most significant risk factor
  - Surgical access may also be difficult
- Male sex
- Sleep apnea
- Mallampati grade 3-4
- Presence of a beard

## Factors Affecting Mask Ventilation

### Anesthetic Factors

- Experience of the clinician and the use of equipment.
- Use of correctly sized adjuncts (OPA and NPA).
- MV may be difficult due to improperly sized mask or faults with the machine or breathing circuit.
- Aspects of general anesthesia can lead to increased muscle rigidity, reduced chest wall compliance, and difficult MV:
  - High dose opioids
  - Inadequate depth of anesthesia
  - Inadequate muscle relaxation
- Chest wall rigidity associated with high dose opioids is not seen in patients with tracheostomy.
  - Suggests resistance to MV is due to vocal cord closure, which resolves on administration of muscle relaxant.
  - Muscle relaxants can improve MV by eliminating rigidity and laryngospasm or make it more difficult by causing loss of tone and upper airway collapse.
- NAP4 Recommendations:
  - Where facemask or laryngeal mask anesthesia is complicated by failed ventilation and increasing hypoxia, consider early administration of further anesthetic agent and/or a muscle relaxant to exclude and treat laryngospasm.
  - No anesthetist should allow airway obstruction and hypoxia to develop to the stage where an emergency surgical airway is necessary without having administered a muscle relaxant.

### Patient Factors

- Check anesthetic chart for previous difficulty.

#### Factors Affecting Airway Management

- **Enlarged Soft Tissues**:
  - Large tongue/epiglottis
  - Tonsillar hyperplasia
  - Airway edema
- **Abnormal Anatomy**:
  - Edentulous
  - Beard
  - Tumors
  - Foreign bodies
  - Pneumothorax
  - Previous neck irradiation
- **Physiological Reactions**:
  - Laryngospasm
  - Bronchospasm

### Important Patient-Specific Factors

- Obesity:
  - BMI of 26 is a statistically significant predictor of difficult MV.
  - Neck circumference more than 40 cm also increases difficulty.
- Increasing age:
  - Loss of elasticity in tissues.
  - Presence of lung disease.
- Male gender
- Mallampati grading
- Ability for mandibular protrusion:
  - Indicates ability to perform jaw thrust.
  - Important in patients at risk of upper airway collapse.
  - Good predictor of difficult intubation.
- History of obstructive sleep apnea

### Mnemonics for Predicting Difficult Mask Ventilation

- **MMMMASK**:
  - Male gender
  - Mask seal issues
  - Mallampati grade 3 or 4
  - Mandibular protrusion
  - Age
  - Snoring/sleep apnea
  - Kilograms (weight)
- **OBESE**:
  - Obese (BMI > 26 kg/m²)
  - Bearded
  - Edentulous
  - Snoring
  - Elderly (>55 years)

## Management

### Expected Difficult MV

- **Simple Measures**:
  - Shave beard/slick down beard with jelly.
  - Weight loss.
  - Keeping dentures in situ to improve seal and removing them prior to intubation.
- Prepare necessary equipment/adjuncts.
- Optimal preoxygenation: increases apneic time.
- Proper positioning of the patient decreases dependent atelectasis:
  - In obese patients, the ear should be at the same level as the sternal notch.
  - Ramped position improves ventilation and laryngoscopy view.
  - Aligns oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes.
- **Patel and Nouraei**:
  - Maintain oxygenation using Transnasal Humidified Rapid Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE).
  - Only works if the airway remains patent.
  - In cases where there are signs of difficult MV and intubation, awake fibreoptic intubation might be the correct choice.

### Difficult MV Predicted but Easy Intubation Anticipated

- Consider RSI:
  - Benefit is quicker onset of neuromuscular blockade to facilitate earlier intubation without the need for MV.
  - Risks include desaturation at the time of onset of muscle relaxation and failure to intubate.
- In elective cases, a back-up plan is inserting an SAD.
- In emergency, unfasted cases, there is a risk of aspiration.
- Consider awake fibre-optic intubation.

### Unexpected Difficult MV

- No agreed adult algorithm.
- **Proposed Algorithm by El-Orbany and Woehlck**:
  - Optimize patient position.
  - Use airway adjuncts: NPA and OPA.
  - Apply continuous positive airway pressure.
  - Check depth of anesthesia.
  - Administer muscle relaxation.
  - Reduce cricoid pressure.
- If difficulty remains (sats drop, lack of ETCO₂):
  - Call for help to allow for a two-person (four-hand) technique and/or change operator.
  - Request difficult airway trolley.
- No improvement:
  - Saturations below 90%: situation considered an impossible MV scenario.
- Impossible MV:
  - Consider waking the patient.
  - If neuromuscular blocking drug has been given, attempt intubation.
	- If Rocuronium was given, consider Sugammadex.
  - If unable to intubate, two attempts at insertion of SAD is appropriate.
  - If NMBD not given, insertion of SAD is appropriate.
	- With SAD in situ, consider using it to facilitate intubation.
  - If saturation continues to drop, this is a CICV scenario.
	- Requires cannula or surgical cricothyroidotomy.
  - Chimes and Fritz described the Vortex approach:
	- Oxygenation via facemask, SAD, or ETT with a maximum of three attempts at each.
	- Can occur in any order after each one is optimized.
	- If oxygenation fails with these techniques, proceed to a surgical airway.
  - Team debrief to discuss events and accurate documentation should follow.

## Complications of Difficult Mask Ventilation

### Failure to Oxygenate

- Death
- Hypoxic brain injury
- Myocardial ischemia

### Injuries to Various Body Parts

- **Eyes**:
  - Direct trauma from mask or fingers.
  - Dry gases leaking from the mask.
- **Nose**:
  - Nasal airway adjuncts can cause false passages and bleeding.
  - Pressure injury with excessive force of mask against the nose.
- **Mouth**:
  - Injury to teeth, lips, soft palate, uvula, and nerves.
  - Lack of lubrication and excessive force increases the risk.

### Increased Inflation Pressure via Adjustable Pressure-Limiting (APL) Valve

- If the airway is not patent, air will be directed into the stomach, increasing intra-gastric pressure:
  - Raised diaphragms and decreased lung compliance.
  - More difficult MV.
- Keep APL valve to the minimum required and below 20 cm H₂O.
- Pediatric guidelines: insert NG tube.

### Increase in Intra-Thoracic Pressure

- Can compromise venous return:
  - Hypotension
  - Decreased coronary perfusion

## Difficult Mask Ventilation and Difficult Intubation

- Incidence of 0.4%.
  - Difficulty defined as grade 3 or 4 MV and grade 3 or 4 laryngoscopy.
  - 25% of impossible-to-ventilate patients were also difficult to intubate.

# DAS Guidelines for Awake Tracheal Intubation (ATI)

## Definitions

- **ATI**: Awake tracheal intubation
- **ATI using Flexible Bronchoscopy**: Utilization of a flexible bronchoscope for ATI
- **ATI using Videolaryngoscopy**: Utilization of a videolaryngoscope for ATI
- **FONA**: Front-of-neck airway
- **STOP**: Sedation, topicalization, oxygenation, performance
- **Minimal Sedation**: Drug-induced state with verbal command response
- **Airway Topicalization**: Local anesthesia applied to the airway
- **Performance**: Practical conduct of awake tracheal intubation
- **Two-Point Check**:
  - Visualization through cords
  - Capnography confirmation
- **Unsuccessful Attempt**: Not achieved after 3+1 attempts
- **Unsuccessful ATI**: Unplanned removal from the airway

## Level of Evidence

### Grading of Recommendations

- **Grade A**: Consistent systematic reviews of RCTs
- **Grade B**: Consistent systematic reviews of low-quality RCTs, case-control studies
- **Grade C**: Case series, reports, extrapolations from low-quality RCTs
- **Grade D**: Expert opinion, inconclusive studies

## Recommendations

1. Awake tracheal intubation must be considered in the presence of predictors of difficult airway management.
2. A cognitive aid such as a checklist is recommended before and during the performance of awake tracheal intubation.
3. Supplemental oxygen should always be administered during awake tracheal intubation.
4. Effective topicalization must be established and tested. The maximum dose of lidocaine should not exceed 9 mg/kg lean body weight.
5. Cautious use of minimal sedation can be beneficial. This should ideally be administered by an independent practitioner. Sedation should not be used as a substitute for inadequate airway topicalization.
6. The number of attempts should be limited to three, with one further attempt by a more experienced operator (3 + 1).
7. Anesthesia should only be induced after a two-point check (visual confirmation and capnography) has confirmed correct tracheal tube position.
8. All departments should support anesthetists to attain competency and maintain skills in awake tracheal intubation.

## Indications and Contraindications

- **Indications**:
  - Patients with head and neck pathology (including malignancy, previous surgery or radiotherapy)
  - Reduced mouth opening
  - Limited neck extension
  - Obstructive sleep apnea
  - Morbid obesity
  - Progressive airway compromise
- **Considerations**:
  - Awake tracheal intubation must be considered in the presence of predictors of difficult airway management.
  - In an elective setting, the patient should be appropriately fasted (Grade D).
  - In the non-fasted patient, the potential for regurgitation or aspiration of gastric contents still exists even with ATI.
- **Contraindications**:
  - Relative contraindications include local anesthetic allergy, airway bleeding, uncooperative patients.
  - The only absolute contraindication is patient refusal.

## Ergonomics

- **Monitors**:
  - It is recommended that ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and continuous end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring are used throughout the process of ATI (Grade C).
  - It is acknowledged that end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring during ATI may be challenging in current practice.

## DAS ATI Technique

### Oxygenate

- **Apply HFNO early**
- **Titrate HFNO** from 30–70 L/min⁻¹
- **Continue HFNO** throughout the procedure

### Topicalise

- **Lidocaine 10%**: Spray to oropharynx, tonsillar pillars, base of tongue
- **20–30 sprays**: During inspiration, over 5 min
- **If nasal route**: Co-phenylcaine spray
- **Test topicalisation atraumatically**
- **Lidocaine 4%**: Nebulise 4-6 mL, max dose
	- Further 5 sprays of lidocaine 10% to the tongue base as tolerated
	- **2–4 mL of 2% lidocaine** via cricothyroid membrane
	- **Catheter working channel of FB**: 1-2 mL aliquots
	- **Lidocaine 10%**:
		- 2 mL = 10 sprays (10-15 mg)
		- Max 5 mg/kg
	- **Co-phenylcaine**: 5 mL = 12.5 mg lidocaine + 1.25 mg phenylephrine

### Sedate

- **Sedate if required**
- **Remifentanil TCI**: 0.1–0.3 ng.mL⁻¹
	- If second anaesthetist present, consider adding midazolam 0.5–1 mg

### Perform

- **Select appropriate tracheal tube**
- **Patient sitting up**
- **Ensure operator can readily see patient**: Infusion pumps and video screen
- **Clear secretions**
- **For ATI
	
	**:
	- Operator positioned facing patient
	- Check ETT passage through cords
	- Consider bougie
- **For ATI
	
	**:
	- Operator behind patient
	- Consider bougie
- **Before induction of anaesthesia**: Two-point check
- Two point checklist for confirmation of ETT placement
	- A two-point check is therefore required to confirm the position of the tracheal tube: 1 visualisation of the tracheal lumen with ATI:FB or the tracheal tube through the vocal cords with ATI:VL to confirm tracheal placement; and 2 capnography to exclude oesophageal intubation (Grade C)
		- Anaesthesia should be induced only when the twopoint check has confirmed correct tracheal tube placement (Grade D).
## Characteristics of Drugs Used Commonly During ATI

### Antisialogogue

# Glottic and Supraglottic Tumors

## Preparation for Anesthesia

### Special Investigations

- **Patient Specific**:
  - The role of routine pulmonary function testing (PFT) is debatable in the era of detailed 3-dimensional imaging. Historically, PFTs were used to identify the type/level of airway compromise. For glottic and subglottic tumors, which are known to be extrathoracic, this distinction is less useful. Additionally, PFTs in distressed patients are not reproducible and often unhelpful.
  - Detailed computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans provide anatomical details that guide surgery planning and prognostication, assisting in airway management strategy, including selecting airway devices.
  - CT or MRI imaging can create virtual 3-dimensional models for virtual endoscopy (VE), allowing clinicians to "practice" flexible endoscopic intubation and anticipate difficulty.
- **Fasting**:
  - Patients should be fasted according to guidelines.
- **Preoperative Endoscopic Airway Examination (PEAE)**:
  - Promptly commence topicalization of the airway with nebulized lidocaine and vasoconstrictor (4% lidocaine with adrenaline or phenylephrine) where PEAE will be performed.
  - If an awake technique is planned, preparation can occur in parallel with loading an intravenous analgosedative (e.g., dexmedetomidine) in the preanesthetic/induction room. Administer a modest dose of antisialogogue (e.g., glycopyrrolate 1-2 mcg/kg) before topicalization to prevent alpha-adrenergic-induced bradycardia.

### Airway Assessment in Patients with Glottic and Supraglottic Tumors

- **Anamnesis**:
  - Assess for the presence/onset/duration of vocal changes, difficulty swallowing, previous head and neck procedures (including radiotherapy), positional symptoms, and effort tolerance.
  
- **Physical Examination**:
  - Assess neck mobility, mouth opening, physical obstruction due to the lesion, displacement/mobility of laryngeal structures, and impingement due to soft tissue mass.
  - Document interincisor distance, thyromental distance, thyrohyoid distance, dentition, mandibular protrusion (or upper lip bite test), and neck circumference to alert practitioners to potential difficulties.
  - Consider awake tracheal intubation for patients with clear indications (e.g., limited mouth opening, fixed neck flexion, previous neck radiotherapy).
- **Preoperative Endoscopic Airway Examination (PEAE)**:
  - Perform PEAE at the time of arrival for surgery, even if prior diagnostic endoscopy has been documented.
  - PEAE can be performed under topical anesthesia in the induction room or operating theatre by the anesthesiologist or surgeon. Grading the airway by endoscopic view as per the five categories of Moorthy et al. can guide airway strategy.

### Grading of the Airway on PEAEs (Adapted from Moorthy Et al.)

- **Grade 0**: No hoarseness of voice, normal larynx
- **Grade 1**: Small lesions, vocal folds fully visible
- **Grade 2a**: May have hoarseness, tumor/cyst visible, no obstruction
- **Grade 2b**: Hoarseness without respiratory difficulty, partial view of vocal folds
- **Grade 3**: Hoarseness and respiratory difficulty, vocal folds difficult to see, laryngeal opening may be seen
- **Grade 4**: Significant vocal changes, vocal cords and laryngeal opening cannot be identified with flexible endoscopy
- **Infiltration of Local Anesthetic**:
  - For significant difficulty (e.g., Moorthy grades 3 or 4), infiltrate the anterior neck over the cricothyroid membrane and potential tracheostomy site with a mixture of local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor (e.g., dilute adrenaline). Inject local anesthetic into the tracheal lumen. This is best performed during airway ultrasound to confirm the site and avoid blood vessels and the tumor. Transcricoid injection of local anesthetic is feasible but generally, tracheostomy is preferred over cricothyroidotomy.

## Anesthetic Induction and Airway Management

### Fundamental Decisions

- **Awake vs. Induction**:
  - Decide whether to manage the airway awake or if it is safe to induce anesthesia and then intubate the patient.
  - Inhalational induction and laryngoscopy during spontaneous ventilation have a high failure rate and risk of airway patency loss. Avoid unless experienced and confident in the technique.
- **Supraglottic Airway Devices (SGAs)**:
  - Recognize SGAs require adequate mouth opening, absence of significant obstruction, and relatively normal anatomy to seal adequately.
  - Direct obstruction or displacement of the larynx or trachea by a tumor must be recognized when considering front-of-neck rescue.
- **PEAE**:
  - Use PEAE to inform both intubation and ventilation criteria. For patients who cannot be induced safely but also present major difficulty for awake intubation or tracheostomy, consider extracorporeal oxygenation under local anesthesia.

### Anesthesia Prior to Intubation

- **Preoxygenation**:
  - Excellent preoxygenation, possibly supplemented by an apnoeic oxygenation strategy, must be routine.
- **Induction Agents**:
  - Propofol is useful in blunting airway reflexes. Neuromuscular blockade should ideally be rapid-acting (e.g., rocuronium or succinylcholine). Avoid relying on reversal agents in a "cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate" scenario.
- **Video Laryngoscopy (VL)**:
  - VL improves the ability to see the larynx and turns intubation into a team effort. Use hyperangulated VL blades for large glottic tumors. Always use an introducer. Use a "high and dry" approach with gentle insertion and suctioning to avoid soiling the lens.

### Awake Airway Management

- **Topicalization**:
  - Thorough and excellent topicalization of the airway is crucial.
  - Remifentanil or dexmedetomidine can be used, but require different approaches. Continuous oxygenation during airway management (e.g., nasal cannula or high-flow nasal oxygenation) is mandatory. THRIVE has shown promising results.

## Intraoperative Care

- **Target-Controlled Infusion (TCI)**:
  - **Remifentanil**: Offers intense analgesic/sympatholytic effects. Titrate infusion of 0.05-0.40 mcg/kg/min. Plan for postoperative analgesia to address opiate-induced hyperalgesia.
  - **Sufentanil**: Ideal for procedures of longer duration (3-4 hours or more). Use the Gepts model for TCI. Load with at least 40 mcg before surgery, targeting 0.15-0.40 mcg/ml during surgery, and decrement to 0.08-0.16 mcg/ml by awakening/extubation.
- **NMDA-Receptor Antagonists**:
  - Avoid ketamine due to sympathomimetic effects. Use magnesium if an NMDA-receptor antagonist or synergistic analgesic is required.

## Emergence

- **Postoperative Airway Management**:
  - Surgical debulking may convert an obstructive laryngeal cancer into an adequate airway. Consider tracheostomy for significant postoperative airway obstruction.
  - Aim for a smooth emergence with spontaneous ventilation and minimal coughing.
  - When using opiates by TCI, maintain a background remifentanil infusion while establishing spontaneous breathing or target sufentanil effect-site concentration at the apnoeic threshold (0.16 mcg/ml or less).
