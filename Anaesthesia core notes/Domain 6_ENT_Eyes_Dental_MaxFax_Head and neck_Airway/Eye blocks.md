# Anatomy

- **Muscles:** Globe movements are controlled by four rectus muscles and two oblique muscles, forming an incomplete muscle cone containing most of the nerves and vessels supplying the globe.
- **Innervation:**
  - **Sensory:** Provided mainly by the first (ophthalmic) branch of CN V.
  - **Autonomic:** Sympathetic afferents from the stellate ganglion and parasympathetic afferents from the nucleus of CN III.
- **Optic Nerve:** Enters the orbit through the optic foramen, surrounded by a meningeal sheath, posing a risk of accidental injection into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
- **Blood Supply:** Entire orbit is supplied by the ophthalmic artery (a branch of the internal carotid) which enters the orbit superomedially and closely follows the course of the optic nerve.
- **Tenon’s Capsule:** The fascial sheath of the eyeball, defining the sub-Tenon’s space, a potential space fused with the bulbar conjunctiva anteriorly.

# Physiology

- **Intra-ocular Pressure (IOP):** Normal range is 10-20 mmHg. Both local and general anaesthesia can increase IOP, requiring caution in patients with elevated baseline IOP.

# Contraindications

- Patient refusal, inability to consent and cooperate, infection of the eye or surrounding tissue, and (rarely) allergy to local anaesthetic agents.

# Eye Blocks

## Topical

- **Indications:** Suitable for superficial surgery, including removal of foreign bodies and some cataract surgery.
- **Benefits:** Provides surface anaesthesia without the risks of a block.

## Local

- **Indications:** Oculoplastic procedures such as eyelid surgery.
- **Technique:** Skin around the operative site is infiltrated with local anaesthesia.

## Sharp Needle Blocks

### Retrobulbar Block

- **Technique:** A long needle is used to inject small volumes (around 3 ml) of anaesthetic into the muscle cone behind the globe. Additional injection to the facial nerve is usually required for lid anaesthesia.
- **Complications:**
  - Globe perforation
  - Retrobulbar haemorrhage
  - Damage to the optic nerve or artery
  - Accidental administration of LA into the CSF, leading to seizures or arrest

### Peribulbar Block

- **Technique:** Higher volumes of anaesthetic are required as the injection is extraconal and relies on spread of anaesthetic through the orbit.
- **Common Sites:** Inferotemporal (lateral to the lateral limbus) and medial canthus injections.
- **Benefits:** Useful in corneal graft surgery as they avoid distortion of the conjunctiva, and in patients with scleral bands from previous surgery where a sub-Tenon’s injection would not spread posteriorly.

## Blunt Cannula Block

### Sub-Tenon’s Block

- **Technique:** A blunt cannula is used to place local anaesthetic into the sub-Tenon’s space, providing anaesthesia and akinesia with a lower risk of serious complications compared to sharp needle blocks.
- **Indications:** Suitable for cataract surgery and vitreoretinal work, with high levels of patient satisfaction.
- **Procedure:**
  1. Obtain consent, establish IV line with basic monitors.
  2. Apply topical anaesthesia, commonly with proxymetacaine drops.
  3. Clean the eye with iodine.
  4. Insert an eyelid speculum to hold the lids apart.
  5. Pinch the conjunctiva and Tenon’s capsule 5-10 mm from the limbus using non-toothed forceps, forming a small ‘tent’.
  6. Make an incision in the tent with round-ended scissors to expose the sclera.
  7. Gently insert the scissors into the hole and open to create a small passage into the sub-Tenon’s space.
  8. Insert a blunt, curved cannula (commonly 19G, 25 mm) into the space, following the curve of the globe.
  9. Insert to a depth of 15-20 mm until the syringe is nearly vertical when in the correct position to inject.
  10. Slowly inject 3-5 ml of anaesthetic, watching for chemosis (conjunctival oedema).
  11. Apply gentle pressure on the closed eye to encourage spread of the local anaesthetic (contraindicated in glaucoma).
  12. Assess akinesia as a reliable indicator of an effective block.
- **Complications:**
  - Chemosis
  - Subconjunctival swelling
  - Haemorrhage (usually resolves with gentle pressure)
- **Local Mix:** 1:1 mixture of lidocaine and bupivacaine with hyaluronidase at concentrations up to 30 IU/ml (to improve spread).

# Ophthalmic Blocks for Anaesthesia Summary

## Topical Ophthalmic Anaesthesia

- **Indications:** Corneal surgery
- **Local Anaesthetic (LA):**
  - Amethocaine 1%
  - Proxymetacaine 0.5%
- **Side Effects/Complications:** Not applicable
- **Clinical Points:** Not applicable

## Peribulbar Block

- **Indications:** Globe, cataract, and retinal surgery
- **Landmarks (LM):** Sclerocorneal junction (limbus), medial canthus, caruncle, inferior orbital rim
- **Technique:**
  - **Inferolateral Injection:**
	- Palpate IO rim in line with limbus.
	- Inject 1mm above rim & just lateral, either transcutaneous or transconjunctival.
	- Initially back & slightly inferior, then redirect posteriorly under globe.
  - **Medial Injection:**
	- Inject medial to caruncle, backwards & slightly medial to touch medial wall, then redirect posteriorly.
- **Stim/end point:** Depth 20-25mm
- **Local Anaesthetic (LA):**
  - Lignocaine 2ml 2% with Hyalase 10-30u/ml plus 3ml 0.5% Levobupivacaine
- **Side Effects/Complications:**
  - Conjunctival oedema
  - Proptosis
  - Retrobulbar haemorrhage
  - Globe perforation
  - Subarachnoid injection
  - Extraocular muscle damage
- **Clinical Points:**
  - Bevel facing globe.
  - Use a 25g 25mm needle.
  - If axial length (AL) > 27mm, consider only medial injection or Sub-Tenon’s.

## Sub-Tenon’s Block

- **Indications:** Globe, cataract, and retinal surgery
- **Landmarks (LM):** Sclerocorneal junction (limbus)
- **Technique:**
  - Install LA drops in inferonasal quadrant.
  - Raise conjunctiva with Moorfield’s forceps.
  - Make a 5mm incision from limbus using Wescott spring scissors.
  - Dissect the space inferonasally between sclera (vascular) & Tenon’s capsule (white, avascular).
  - Insert a curved sub-Tenon’s needle backwards beyond the equator.
- **Stim/end point:** Not applicable
- **Local Anaesthetic (LA):**
  - Lignocaine 2ml 2% with Hyalase 10-30u/ml plus 3ml 0.5% Levobupivacaine
- **Side Effects/Complications:**
  - Bleeding
  - Chemosis
  - Subconjunctival haemorrhage
  - Proptosis
- **Clinical Points:**
  - Less risk of bleeding but less akinesis compared with peribulbar.
