# Physiology
## Blood Supply

![](Pasted%20image%2020240131140611.png)

## Blood Flow Regulation

![](Pasted%20image%2020240131140644.png)

### Hepatic Portal Vein Regulation

There is no autoregulation in the hepatic portal vein.

#### Intrinsic Control
1. **Myogenic Response**
   - Vasoconstriction in response to stretch or increased pressure.

2. **Metabolic Response**
   - Vasodilation in response to metabolic buildup, including increased CO₂, reduced pH, and hypoxia.

3. **Hepatic Artery Buffer Response**
   - Reduced flow in the portal vein leads to vasodilation of the hepatic artery due to adenosine buildup.

#### Extrinsic Control
1. **Neuronal Control**
   - Sympathetic: Induces vasoconstriction.
   - Parasympathetic: Regulates distribution.

2. **Humoral Control**
   - Sympathoadrenal Effect: Blood flow to the liver is less affected compared to the splanchnic circulation. The hepatic artery first undergoes vasoconstriction followed by vasodilation.

### Hepatic Segments

The liver is divided into 8 segments, each with its own portal venous blood supply and venous drainage. The right side of the liver is larger than the left.

### Signs and Management of Liver Failure

#### Signs
**Usually related to complications:**

**SCREAM J** (Management according to complications):

- **S**epsis: Antibiotics
- **C**oagulopathy: Vitamin K
- **R**enal Problems (hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, uremia, etc.): Octreotide, correct metabolic abnormalities

#### Management
1. **Cardiovascular System (CVS):**
   - Profound vasodilation and circulatory collapse: volume replacement guided by CO-monitor, ± vasopressors

2. **Coagulation:**
   - Check PT every 12 hours but do not correct routinely; correct only if acutely hemorrhaging or before invasive procedures

3. **Renal Function:**
   - RRT for oligo-/anuric RF, using CVVHD with a lactate-free dialysate

4. **Infection:**

- **Formula**:
	- MELD = 3.8 {serum bilirubin (mg/dL)} + 11.2 {INR} + 9.6 {serum creatinine (mg/dL)} + 6.4 (if patient had two or more hemodialysis treatments or 24 h of CVVHD in the week prior)
- **MELD Score and Mortality**:
	- <9: 1.9%
	- 10-19: 6.0%
	- 20-29: 19.6%
	- 30-39: 52.6%
	- > 40: 71.3%
## Child-Pugh Classification for Staging Liver Disease

**Easy Way to Remember:**

| Points | Ascites | Encephalopathy | INR    |
|--------|---------|----------------|--------|
| 1      | None    | Grade 0        | < 1.7  |
| 2      | Slight  | Grade 1-2      | 1.7-2.3|
| 3      | Moderate| Grade 3-4      | > 2.3  |

**Consider liver transplantation for a score of more than 7.**
# Associated Conditions

## Cirrhotic Cardiomyopathy
- Defined by impaired contractile responsiveness to physiological or pharmacological stress, impaired left ventricular relaxation, and electrophysiologic abnormalities such as a prolonged QT interval.
- Characterized by systolic and diastolic dysfunction and electrophysiologic changes.
- Presents as a blunted response to β-adrenergic receptor agonists, potentially rendering vasopressor therapy ineffective at traditional doses.

## Hepatic Encephalopathy

- Associated with the accumulation of neurotoxins such as ammonia, short-chain fatty acids, and mercaptans.
- Toxins can bypass the liver via portosystemic shunts, leading to impaired metabolism and cerebral edema as glutamine increases intracellular osmolality.
- Progression of liver failure can lead to hepatic coma and cerebral edema.

### Classification of Hepatic Encephalopathy
- **Unimpaired:** No signs or symptoms; normal psychometric or neuropsychological tests.
- **Grades 0 to 1:** Minimal or covert hepatic encephalopathy; mild clinical symptoms, altered sleep rhythm, abnormal psychometric or neuropsychological tests.
- **Grade 2:** Obvious personality change, inappropriate behavior, asterixis, dysphraxia, disorientation, lethargy.
- **Grade 3:** Somnolence, gross disorientation, bizarre behavior, disorientation to time and space.
- **Grade 4:** Coma.

## Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS)

### Types
**Type 1:**
- Rapidly progressive acute kidney injury with a doubling of serum creatinine to >221 μmol/L in <2 weeks.
- Often precipitated by events such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
- Rapid progression to multiorgan failure with a poor prognosis, median survival of 2 weeks.

**Type 2:**
- Moderate renal failure, fluctuates over time, may convert to Type 1 upon further insult.
- Associated with refractory ascites.
- Steady, slowly progressive course, median survival of 2-6 months.

### Definition
- Functional renal impairment in patients with advanced liver disease or severe fulminant liver injury.
- Characterized by increased renal vasoconstriction, reduced glomerular filtration rate, increased creatinine, and impaired sodium and water excretion.

### Pathophysiology
- Portal hypertension leads to profound systemic and splanchnic vasodilatation and intravascular volume depletion.
- Increases renal vasoconstriction via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway and sympathetic nervous system activation, leading to significant hypoperfusion of the kidneys.

### Diagnosis
- Absence of primary kidney disease, proteinuria, or systemic hypovolemia causing renal hypoperfusion.
- Normal urinary sediment, low urinary sodium (<10 mEq/L), uremia, and oliguria.
- Serum creatinine is a poor marker due to cachexia and poor muscle mass.

### Management
- Type 1 HRS can be treated with albumin and vasoconstrictors like terlipressin.
- Other vasoconstrictors: vasopressin, midodrine, norepinephrine.
- Renal replacement therapy (RRT) to stabilize patients before liver transplantation (LT).
- Reversible with LT; prolonged endothelial damage may lead to irreversible tubular necrosis, requiring a combined liver-kidney transplant.

## Hepatopulmonary Syndrome

### Pathogenesis
- Enhanced production or impaired clearance of vasodilators (nitric oxide, vasodilator prostaglandins) or inhibition of vasoconstrictive substances leads to diffuse or localized dilatation of pulmonary vessels.
- Increased pulmonary blood flow without an increase in ventilation leads to a V/Q mismatch.
- Dilatation of vessels causes increased diffusion distance and abnormalities.
- Presence of intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunts and porto-venous anastomoses.

### Diagnosis
- Defined by the triad of liver disease, hypoxemia, and intrapulmonary vascular shunting.
- Diagnosed with agitated saline on ECHO and serial SpO₂/ABG.

#### Diagnostic Criteria
- **Oxygenation defect:** PaO₂ <80 mm Hg or alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient ≥15 mm Hg.
- **Pulmonary vascular dilatation:** Positive contrast-enhanced echocardiography or abnormal brain uptake in lung perfusion scanning.
- **Liver disease:** Portal hypertension with or without cirrhosis.

#### Severity
- **Mild:** Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient ≥15 mm Hg, PaO₂ ≥80 mm Hg.
- **Moderate:** Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient ≥15 mm Hg, PaO₂ 60 to <80 mm Hg.
- **Severe:** Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient ≥15 mm Hg, PaO₂ 50 to <60 mm Hg.
- **Very severe:** Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient ≥15 mm Hg, PaO₂ <50 mm Hg on 100% oxygen.

### Clinical Features
- Exertional dyspnea, fatigue, clubbing, spider angiomata.
- Platypnea (dyspnea in the upright position relieved by recumbency).
- Orthodeoxia (arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation in the upright position).

### Management
- Medical therapy is often ineffective; liver transplantation is the only treatment option.

## Portopulmonary Hypertension

### Definition
- Mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mm Hg in a patient with liver disease and portal hypertension.

### Pathogenesis
- Similar histological changes to idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension (medial hypertrophy, intimal proliferation, thrombosis, fibrotic changes).
- Clinically presents with exertional dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope.

### Diagnosis
- Screening with transthoracic Doppler echocardiography and right heart catheterization.
- Mean pulmonary pressure >25 mmHg or pulmonary vascular resistance >240 dynes/sec/cm⁵.

### Classification
- **Moderate:** Pulmonary artery pressure of 35-45 mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance >250 dynes/s/cm⁵.
- **Severe:** Pulmonary artery pressure >50 mmHg.

### Management
- Increases the risk of mortality associated with liver transplant.
- Severe cases have nearly 100% mortality with liver transplant.

## Acute Variceal Hemorrhage

### Management
1. Prompt, aggressive fluid resuscitation.
2. Correct coagulopathy with clotting factors and 10 mg Vitamin K IV.
3. Early upper GI endoscopy with airway protection after adequate fluid resuscitation.
4. Parenteral antibiotics for 5-10 days.
5. If hemostasis cannot be achieved endoscopically:
   - Sengstaken-Blakemore tube.
   - Consider transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS).

## Portal Hypertension

### Definition
- Increase in portal system pressure, diverting a large amount of blood from the portal system to the systemic venous system bypassing the liver, leading to extensive collateral formation (variceal, gastric, anorectal).

### Pathophysiology
- Increased vascular resistance to portal blood flow.
- Reactive splanchnic dilation maintains and aggravates portal hypertension.
- RAAS activation leads to aldosterone release, sodium and water retention, and expanded plasma volume.

### Causes
- **Pre-sinusoidal:** Portal vein thrombosis, lymphadenopathy, pancreatic disease.
- **Sinusoidal:** Cirrhosis, schistosomiasis.
- **Post-sinusoidal:** Constrictive pericarditis, Budd-Chiari syndrome.

### Clinical Features
- Splenomegaly, collateral veins (caput medusae), ascites, edema.
- Hemoptysis, melena, hemorrhoids.
- Increased risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome.

### Management
- Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) to prevent bleeding.
- Active bleeding management includes ABC, octreotide, endoscopic banding, balloon tamponade, TIPS.
- Treat ascites and encephalopathy.

## Coagulopathy in Liver Disease
### Hemorrhagic Risk
- Reduced synthesis of procoagulant factors (II, V, VII, IX, X).
- Thrombocytopenia due to hypersplenism and decreased thrombopoietin production.
- Platelet function defects, dysfibrinogenemia, increased tPA.

### Thrombotic Risk
- Decreased anticoagulants (protein C, protein S, antithrombin).
- Increased procoagulant factors (Factor VIII, vWF).

### Assessment
- Conventional coagulation tests (clotting time, PT, INR, aPTT) measure part of thrombin generation.
- Preferred tests: thromboelastography or thrombin generation assay with thrombomodulin.
- INR-liver: Modified INR using plasma from cirrhosis patients.
- Measure fibrinogen levels before surgery and replace if <100 mg/dL with cryoprecipitate.

# Anaesthesia for Liver Disease
## Effects of Anaesthesia in Liver Disease

### Pharmacokinetic Effects
- **Reduced Protein Synthesis:** Decreased protein binding.
- **Decreased Metabolism:** Reduction in Phase I and Phase II metabolic processes.
- **Ascites:** Increased volume of distribution (Vd).
- **Portocaval Shunting:** Increased bioavailability.
- **PT/PTT/INR:** Tests synthetic function; transaminases (TA) test inflammation, which may occur independently.
- **Acute Phase Protein Production:** Prioritized during illness, albumin production is not.
- **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** Avoid opiates and benzodiazepines.
- **Coagulopathy:** Avoid regional anaesthesia.

### Pharmacokinetics

- **Decreased Hepatic Metabolism:** Reduced metabolism of drugs.
- **Decreased Renal Excretion:** Caused by Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS) or other renal dysfunction.
- **Reduced Serum Protein Synthesis:**
  - **Albumin:** Increased free fraction of drugs.
  - **Cholinesterase:** Prolonged action of suxamethonium.
- **Increased Total Body Water:** Increased volume of distribution for water-soluble drugs; may require larger bolus doses.

**Hepatic Metabolism Pathways:**
1. **Phase 1:** Biotransformation via the cytochrome P450 system, decreased in liver disease.
2. **Phase 2:** Glucuronide conjugation, relatively spared in initial dysfunction.

**Volatile Anesthetics:**
- **Enflurane and Halothane:** Most decrease in hepatic blood flow.
- **Isoflurane:** 0.2% biotransformation, improves hepatic blood supply through vasodilation.
- **Sevoflurane:** 2-5% biotransformation, improves hepatic blood flow without forming fluoro-acetylated neo-antigens.
- **Desflurane:** 0.02% biotransformation, increases hepatic blood flow, similar to isoflurane.
- **Benzodiazepines:**
  - **Diazepam & Midazolam:** Reduced metabolism, prolonged action, and potential worsening of hepatic encephalopathy.
  - **Lorazepam, Oxazepam, Temazepam:** Metabolized via glucuronide conjugation, less affected by hepatic dysfunction.
- **Opioids:**
  - **Morphine:** Glucuronidation affected in moderate-severe hepatic dysfunction; high hepatic extraction ratio.
  - **Fentanyl & Sufentanil:** High hepatic extraction ratio but single doses are tolerated.
  - **Alfentanil, Morphine, Oxycodone:** Prolonged half-life.
  - **Remifentanil:** No prolonged duration of action.
- **Neuromuscular Blockers:**
  - **Vecuronium and Rocuronium:** Slower onset and longer duration of action.
  - **Cisatracurium:** Metabolism independent of liver.
  - **Propofol:** Duration of action determined by redistribution; no change in clearance and minimal impact on encephalopathy.

### Coagulation

- **Increased Hemorrhagic Risk:**
  - Reduced synthesis of vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factors (II, V, VII, IX, X).
  - Decrease in ADAMTS13 enzyme, thrombocytopenia (portal hypertension), and decreased thrombopoietin.
  - Platelet function defects, dysfibrinogenemia, increased tPA.
- **Increased Thrombotic Risk:**
  - Decrease in anticoagulants (protein C & S, antithrombin, plasminogen).
  - Increase in procoagulant factors (Factor VIII and vWF).

### Assessment
- Conventional coagulation tests (clotting time, PT, INR, aPTT) measure part of thrombin generation.
- Preferred tests evaluate plasma, blood cells, platelets, and fibrinolysis (e.g., thromboelastogram or thrombin generation assay with thrombomodulin).
- INR-liver: Modified INR using plasma from cirrhosis patients.
- Measure fibrinogen levels before surgery and replace if <100 mg/dL with cryoprecipitate.

### QT Interval

- **Prolonged QT Interval:** Seen in 50% of cirrhosis patients; correlates with disease severity, elevated BNP, and decreased survival.
- **ECG Monitoring:** To detect prolonged QT interval.
- **Coronary Artery Disease:** Common due to comorbidities like diabetes, alcohol abuse, and smoking.
### Outline of Management

![](Pasted%20image%2020240131142227.png)

## Anaesthesia Plan
### Concerns
- Drug metabolism
- Coagulopathy
- Hypoglycemia
- Fluid balance
- Hepatorenal and hepatopulmonary syndrome
### Monitors
- Invasive monitors
- IBP and CO monitoring
- NMT
- BIS
### Organs
- Hepatorenal syndrome  
- Hepatopulmonary syndrome  
- Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy:  
	- A hyperdynamic circulation with reduced systemic vascular resistance and increased resting heart rate are associated with CLD. Blunted chronotropic and inotropic responses to stress, impaired diastolic relaxation and prolonged QT interval are also seen and in the absence of other cardiac disease is referred to as cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Recent studies suggest that it may be present in 40–50% of patients with cirrhosis. It usually remains asymptomatic at rest; rapid changes in preload and afterload can manifest this acutely
## Checklist for Chronic Liver Disease Patients Undergoing Anaesthesia

1. **Assessment**: Baseline blood tests, ECG, CXR, ECHO, cardiopulmonary exercise testing
2. **Risk Stratification**: Use liver-specific scoring systems (CTP or MELD)
3. **Conduct of Anaesthesia**:
	- Prefer propofol over benzodiazepines
	- Atracurium preferable to vecuronium/rocuronium (consider sugammadex if used)
	- Avoid suxamethonium
	- Use newer volatiles (desflurane, sevoflurane)
	- Consider invasive monitoring and maintain euvolaemia
	- Utilize viscoelastic tests of coagulation (TEG or ROTEM)
	- Avoid NSAIDs
	- Consider regional anaesthesia to minimize opioids
4. **Immediate Postoperative Care**:
	- Extended recovery preparation
	- Monitor for bleeding, hepatic decompensation, kidney injury
	- High dependency unit admission for major surgeries
5. **Critical Care**:
	- Consider ICU admission for patients with significant comorbidities or undergoing emergency surgery
