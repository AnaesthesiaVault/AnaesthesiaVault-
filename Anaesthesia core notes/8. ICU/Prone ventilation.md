# Prone Position Summary

# Prone Position Physiological Changes

## Cardiovascular Changes

### Cardiovascular
- **↓ Cardiac Index (CI)**
  - ↓ Venous Return (VR)
  - Direct effects on arterial filling
  - ↓ Left Ventricular (LV) compliance secondary to ↑ intrathoracic pressure
- **Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) Compression**
  - ↓ Cardiac Output (CO)
  - ↑ Blood loss
  - Venous stasis → Thrombotic complications
- **↑ Sympathetic response to change in position**

### Respiratory
- **Lung Volumes**
  - ↑ Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)
  - Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) relatively unchanged
- **Distribution of Blood Flow**
  - Lung perfusion more uniformly distributed in prone position
- **Distribution of Ventilation**
  - More even vertical distribution of ventilation in prone position
- **Optimization of Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) Matching**
  - ↑ FRC
  - ↓ Atelectasis
  - Facilitates secretion drainage
  - ↓ Lung deformation
  - Abdomen less likely to distend
  - Heart sits against sternum → lung is less compressed
  - ↓ Transpleural pressure gradient between dependent and non-dependent lung
  - Plateau pressure is more uniformly distributed
  - Recruitment maneuvers more effective
  - Overall compliance unchanged due to ↓ lung resistance offset by ↓ chest wall compliance
  - Dorsoventral orientation of large airways

# Complications

## Central Nervous System (CNS)
- **Occlusion of Vertebral and Carotid Arteries**
  - Avoid excessive extension or rotation of the neck when turning
- **Venous Occlusion**
- **Air Entrainment**: Possible pneumocephalus
- **Cervical Spine Injury**: Avoid excessive neck flexion/extension

## Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)

Peripheral nerve injuries may occur in any position and are thought to be the end result of nerve ischemia from undue stretching or direct pressure. In patients at risk:

- Diabetes
- Peripheral Vascular Disease
- Alcohol Dependency
- Pre-existing Neuropathy
- Anatomical Variants
- Previous Post-operative Neurological Problems

**Assessment**: Assess patients in the proposed operative position while awake. Arms should be next to the side rather than abducted.

## Pressure Injuries

May be direct or indirect (when injury occurs as a result of pressure on, or occlusion of, vascular supply).

### Direct
- Pressure necrosis of skin: Face, breasts, ears, genitalia, iliac crests
- Contact dermatitis
- Tracheal compression: Only reported in patients with underlying anatomical abnormalities
- Salivary gland swelling: Postulated to result from stretching of salivary ducts, leading to stasis and acute swelling
- Shoulder dislocation: Distribution of pressure may lead to anterior dislocation of the shoulder

# Prone Ventilation in ARDS

- Moves the heart anteriorly, unloads the diaphragm, and clears secretions
- Reduced ventral-dorsal pulmonary gradient and more favorable chest wall shape

## Benefits
1. **Improved Oxygenation**
   - More aerated lung (less of a baby lung)
2. **Protection Against Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI)**
   - Larger and more homogeneous lung ventilation (more lung to ventilate)
3. **Reduced Rates of Infection**
4. **Reduced Shunting**

**PROSEVA Trial**: Guerin et al., 2013 showed a marked mortality benefit (NNT = 6) for prone ventilation in severe ARDS (28-day mortality 16% prone versus 32.8% supine)

# Benefits of Prone Position

- **Improved Oxygenation**
- **Improved Respiratory Mechanics (Diaphragm)**
- **More Equal Distribution of Pleural Pressure (Ppl)**: Less Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI)/Patient-Self-Inflicted Lung Injury (P-SILI)
- **Facilitate Draining of Secretions**
- **Increase Lung Volume (FRC)**
- **Improve Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) Matching**
- **Shifting Weight of Mediastinal Contents Anteriorly**
- **Reduce Atelectasis**
