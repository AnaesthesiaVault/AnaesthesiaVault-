# Hemodynamic Management in Shock

## Correct Shock Urgently: Correct Inadequate Cardiac Output and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)

### Shock Definition
- Inadequate oxygen delivery to organs relative to their need results in organ damage.
  - DO2 to the entire body = Cardiac Output (CO) × Oxygen Content of blood.
  - Adequate cardiac output to get blood flow to organs:
	- Cardiac Index (CI) > 2.5L/min/m² is recommended.
### Organ Perfusion
- Organs such as brain and kidneys need blood at reasonable pressure.
- Usual target Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is 65mmHg.
  - If intra-compartment pressure elevated, target MAP to achieve Perfusion Pressure of 50-60mmHg.
	- MAP target = Intracompartment Pressure + Perfusion Pressure.
	- E.g.: head injury with ICP assumed to be 15-20mmHg, and Cerebral Perfusion Pressure of 60mmHg desired: MAP target = 75-80mmHg.

## Identify Mechanisms of Shock
- Typically exist in ICU patients with sepsis or after injury/surgery.
  - Define in your mind which of these mechanisms currently exist and tailor the package of cardiovascular resuscitation to try to address these mechanisms in the most balanced way possible.
- Is there an absolute intravascular fluid deficit due to loss of fluid from the vessels?
	- **Hypovolaemic Shock**
		- Requires rapid fluid administration to replenish intravascular volume.
- Pump failure? Is there inadequate cardiac function due to myocardial damage or due to circulating inflammation-induced myocardial depressant factors?
	- **Cardiogenic Shock**
		- May require reduction of excessive afterload or preload.
		- Consider administration of inotropes.
- Pipes failure? Is there abnormal arteriolar and/or venodilation due to altered sympathetic tone or inflammation-induced vasodilator substances?
	- **Distributive Shock**
		- Maldistribution of blood into abnormally dilated venous beds leads to a synthetic intravascular fluid deficit.
		- Usually addressed by a vasopressor to limit pooling of blood in venous beds.
		- A vasopressor may also be necessary to achieve appropriate arterioconstriction to maintain adequate perfusion pressure to perfuse essential organs.
		- Normal Perfusion Pressure = (MAP = Cardiac Output x Systemic Vascular Resistance), but overzealous vasoconstriction must be avoided as this will lead to excess cardiac afterload which may significantly reduce cardiac output. Use a cardiac output monitor if unsure.
- Is there obstruction to blood flow?
	- **Obstructive Shock**
		- From existing pathophysiology:
		  - E.g.: pulmonary thromboembolism.
		- Elevate cardiac output and blood pressure simultaneously in an attempt to get flow past the obstruction, and, if appropriate, investigate options to lyse clot urgently.
		  - From outside of vessels:
			- Cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, overdistension of lungs (e.g., in bronchospasm).
		  - Relieve the obstruction urgently using appropriate technique.
### Strongly Consider Cardiac Output Monitoring
- If ≥2 mechanisms are thought to co-exist.
- Strongly advised if dose of inotropes or vasopressors increases significantly, or perfusion is poor.
## Define Initial Target Ranges for Shock
- MAP target range:
  - Default 65-70mmHg.
  - Neuroprotection (with likelihood of raised ICP) 75-80mmHg.
  - Higher target range due to possible previous hypertension?
  - Lower target range:
	- Ischaemic heart disease.
	- Uncontrolled bleeding.
- Cardiac index
- Requires Cardiac Output Monitor.
  - Lower limit 2.5 L/min/m².
  - Cardiac output may be adequate in patients recovering from myocardial depression only after organs are adequately oxygenated.
  - Note: patients with predominantly distributive shock may have significantly higher CI than 2.5 L/min/m² and should not aim for this target, as some of this high CI may be driven by inflammation, hyperdynamic circulation, etc. These patients may still have poor organ flow and may cope poorly with increases in afterload, and may thus still need inotropes at a higher CI.
- Are there mechanisms present that act compressive? Pump failure, obstruction to outflow, or venous obstruction?
	- If suspected, consider:
	  - Fluid administration.
	  - Improving venous return (e.g., leg pathology, gut edema, anuric states).
	- Are there ways to manipulate these mechanisms before aggressive volume expansion?
	- Is improvement in venous return alone adequate, or would compression be accepted to avoid compromise to other organs?
## Reason to Strongly Consider Intravascular Volume Expansion if MAP Goals Are Not Being Met
### Identified Factors
- Persistent relative volume depletion (>12%) with related targets not met:
  - Evaluate magnitude of improvement after each bolus and decide on further boluses accordingly.
	- Add the magnitude of cumulative fluid deficit at the same time as initial bolus is given.
	- Ensure perfusion is maintained, if no clinical benefit of additional fluid, withhold further bolus until clearer targets appear.
- Consider whether identified intravascular volume deficit is absolute or relative.
  - **Absolute Deficit**
	- Fluid has been lost from the circulation.
  - **Relative Deficit**
	- Volume capacity has increased due to distributive shock mechanism.
	- To ensure fluid administration, do not expect to “refill” the whole absolute hypovolaemia initially with fluid administration, rather aim to achieve target MAP, if a vasopressor will be needed to limit the excessive vascular capacity and yet the hypovolaemia will be fully managed.
### Manage by Regular Fluid Boluses
- For each bolus, evaluate magnitude of improvement after each bolus and decide on further boluses accordingly.
  - E.g., only manage with regular small boluses.
- Supportively suggested by:
  - Tachycardia.
  - Thirst.
  - Sunken tongue.
  - Collapsing inferior vena cava on ultrasound examination.
  - Increase in CVP >15%, or increase in CI or SV >10% with straight leg raise.
  - Increase in CI or SV >10% with 3ml/kg bolus of intravenous fluids.
  - Collapsing inferior vena cava on ultrasound examination.
  - Signs of diffuse dehydration:
	- Tachycardia.
	- Concentrated urine.
	- Signs of diffuse dehydration.
### Consider Indication of Use of Vasopressor
- Add to fluids in patients not responding appropriately or if volume repletion is limited due to myocardial, vascular, or physiological reasons.
- Considerably increase perfusion pressure and limit fluid overload.
  - Vasopressor choice: e.g., norepinephrine 0.1–1 mcg/kg/min, start at 0.1 mcg/kg/min, titrate up as needed.
  - Phenylephrine is suitable only in young, very fit patients.
  - Epinephrine often can cause excessive tachycardia, usually adequate alternative.
### Introduce Adjunctive Measures
- Adjunctive measures:
  - Vasopressin infusion is also an alternative to norepinephrine if norepinephrine doses are escalating or patient not tolerating well.
  - Inotropes should be considered if contractility is significantly reduced.
  - Phenylephrine infusion for a hypotensive patient with no further inotropy needed.
  - Ensure to continue adding norepinephrine until adequately stabilised.
  - Only consider combination therapy with noradrenaline and low dose of dobutamine.
  - Patients on very high dose noradrenaline could be considered for adjunction of low-dose vasopressin.
### Ensure Team Coordination
- Ensure all team members are aware of hemodynamic goals and strategies to be followed.

# Shock

## Definition

Shock is a life-threatening condition characterized by circulatory failure, leading to inadequate oxygen delivery to meet cellular metabolic needs and oxygen consumption requirements. This results in cellular and tissue hypoxia.

## Pathophysiology of Shock

### Cellular Hypoxia
- **Causes**:
  - Reduced tissue perfusion and/or oxygen delivery
  - Increased oxygen consumption
  - Inadequate oxygen utilization
- **Consequences**:
  - Dysfunction of cell membrane ion pumps
  - Intracellular edema
  - Leakage of intracellular contents into the extracellular space
  - Inadequate regulation of intracellular pH

### Systemic Effects
- **Biochemical Processes**:
  - Progression to acidosis
  - Endothelial dysfunction
  - Stimulation of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cascades
- **Microcirculatory Impairments**:
  - Further reduction in tissue perfusion
  - Complex humoral and microcirculatory processes impair regional blood flow

### Serum Lactate Levels
- **Indicator of Hypoperfusion**:
  - Traditionally used as surrogates for hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia
  - Epinephrine-mediated aerobic glycolysis in skeletal muscle also contributes to hyperlactatemia
  - Useful for risk stratification in undifferentiated shock
## Physiologic Determinants of Tissue Perfusion
- **Blood Pressure (BP)**:
  - Determined by cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR)
  - Formula: **BP = CO x SVR**
- **Cardiac Output (CO)**:
  - Product of heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV)
  - Formula: **CO = HR x SV**
  - Stroke volume determined by:
	- Preload
	- Myocardial contractility
	- Afterload
- **Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)**:
  - Governed by:
	- Vessel length
	- Blood viscosity
	- Vessel diameter (vessel tone)
## Hemodynamic Profiles in Shock
- **Measurement**:
  - Pulmonary artery catheterization
  - Noninvasive CO devices
- **Common Characteristics**:
  - Diminished CO and/or SVR in most forms of shock
  - Occasionally, low SVR relative to high CO (e.g., thyrotoxicosis) can result in poor tissue perfusion
- **Specific Forms of Shock**:
  - Severe hypovolemia, cardiogenic shock, and late-stage obstructive shock:
	- Characterized by low CO and compensatory increase in SVR
	- Attempt to maintain perfusion to vital organs
  - Distributive shock:
	- Associated with reduced SVR
	- Compensatory (but insufficient) increase in CO to maintain adequate oxygen delivery
  - Early phases of hypovolemic and obstructive shock:
	- CO may be normal
  - Severe distributive shock (e.g., sepsis, neurogenic shock) or combined shock:
	- Both CO and SVR may be reduced
- **Special Cases**:
  - Normal CO and SVR:
	- Profound mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g., inheritable mitochondrial disease, carbon monoxide, cyanide poisoning)
	- Shock state occurs despite normal CO, SVR, and tissue perfusion due to inadequate oxygen utilization

| **Pericardial Tamponade** | ↑                                  | ↓                     | ↑                            | <65%                                  |

## Stages of Shock

Shock is a physiological continuum that begins with an inciting event, such as an infection (e.g., abscess) or injury (e.g., gunshot wound), triggering pathophysiological changes that can progress through several stages. Early stages (pre-shock and shock) are more amenable to therapy and are more likely to be reversible compared to end-stage shock, which is associated with irreversible end-organ damage and death.

### Pre-shock

- **Also Known As**: Compensated shock or cryptic shock
- **Characteristics**:
	- Compensatory responses to diminished tissue perfusion
	- Example: In early hypovolemic pre-shock, compensatory tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction may allow an otherwise healthy adult to be asymptomatic and maintain normal or mildly elevated blood pressure despite a 10% reduction in total effective arterial blood volume.
	- Clinical Signs: Tachycardia, modest changes in systemic blood pressure (increase or decrease), mild to moderate hyperlactatemia
	- Potential for Reversal: With timely and appropriate management, deterioration can be prevented and signs of impending deterioration can be reversed (e.g., normalization of heart rate and serum lactate levels).
### Shock

- **Characteristics**:
	- Compensatory mechanisms become overwhelmed
	- Signs and symptoms of organ dysfunction appear
	- Clinical Signs: Symptomatic tachycardia, dyspnea, restlessness, diaphoresis, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, oliguria, cool and clammy skin
	- Pathophysiological Perturbation:
		- Hypovolemic shock: Associated with a 20-25% reduction in arterial blood volume
		- Cardiogenic shock: Cardiac index falls to less than 2.5 L/min/m²
### End-organ Dysfunction

- **Characteristics**:
	- Progressive shock leads to irreversible organ damage, multiorgan failure (MOF), and death.
	- Clinical Signs: Anuria, acute renal failure, severe and recalcitrant hypotension (often related to vasoplegia), worsening hyperlactatemia, acidemia further depressing CO, restlessness evolving into obtundation and coma
	- Outcome: Death is common in this phase of shock.
# Approach to Shock

3. **Infuse 1 litre of isotonic saline or 5% dextrose in isotonic saline as quickly as possible.**
	- Repeat fluid bolus as needed for volume resuscitation, followed by maintenance fluids.
	- Frequent hemodynamic monitoring and measurement of serum electrolytes should be performed to avoid iatrogenic fluid overload.
4. **Administer hydrocortisone (100 mg intravenous bolus), followed by 50 mg intravenously every 6 hours (or 200 mg/24 hours as a continuous intravenous infusion for the first 24 hours).**
	- If hydrocortisone is unavailable, alternatives include methylprednisolone and dexamethasone.
	- Saline must be administered if dexamethasone is given instead of hydrocortisone.
5. **Use supportive measures as needed.**
### Subacute Measures After Stabilization of the Patient

1. Continue intravenous isotonic saline at a slower rate for the next 24 to 48 hours.
2. Search for and treat possible infectious precipitating causes of the adrenal crisis.
3. Taper parenteral glucocorticoid over 1 to 3 days, if precipitating or complicating illness permits, to oral glucocorticoid maintenance dose.
4. For patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, begin mineralocorticoid replacement with fludrocortisone, 0.1 mg by mouth daily, when saline infusion is stopped or hydrocortisone dose is tapered to <40 mg daily.
5. If the patient does not have known adrenal insufficiency, confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying cause.
# Drugs Used to Treat Shock

## Production

- **Endogenous Catecholamines**:
	- Synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine, some of which is derived from phenylalanine.
	- The rate-limiting step involves the formation of L-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) from tyrosine.
	- L-DOPA is further converted to dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.
- **Functions**:
	- **Dopamine**: Acts mostly paracrinally and endocrinally; suppresses central release of TSH and prolactin, acts on dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and regulates vascular tone in renal and other specialized vascular beds.
	- **Norepinephrine**: Neurotransmitter at almost all sympathetic nerve terminal synapses.
		- Long postganglionic sympathetic neurons contain varicosities filled with synaptic vesicles that synthesize and release norepinephrine.
		- When an action potential reaches the terminal synapse, voltage-gated calcium channels open, increasing local intracellular calcium concentrations, leading to vesicle fusion with the cell wall and exocytosis of norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft.
		- Norepinephrine release also creates an autoinhibitory feedback mechanism via presynaptic alpha-2 receptors.
	- **Epinephrine**: Predominantly synthesized and stored in the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.
		- Functions as a hormone acting on distal targets following sympathetic nervous system activation.
		- Main regulator of the "fight or flight" response.
## Metabolism and Administration

- **Half-life**:
	- Endogenous catecholamines have short half-lives (~1 minute) due to diffusion away from action sites and efficient metabolism.
- **Enzymatic Pathways**:
	- **Monoamine Oxidase (MAO)**: High concentrations in nerve terminals.
	- **Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase (COMT)**: Degradation occurs in the liver and kidneys.
	- Both enzymes produce vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) from adrenaline and norepinephrine, and homovanillic acid from dopamine.
- **Administration**:
	- **Dosing**:
		- Adrenaline and norepinephrine are administered via continuous infusion (0.01–0.5 µg/kg/min).
		- Dopamine infusion starts at 1–5 µg/kg/min.
	- **Clinical Titration**:
		- Doses are titrated according to clinical effect, aiming for targets like a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ~60 mmHg.
		- Infusions are given via central venous catheters to prevent tissue necrosis due to extravasation.
		- Adrenaline doses above 1 µg/kg/min unlikely to provide additional benefit due to receptor saturation.
	- **Considerations**:
		- Circulating cortisol levels, receptor desensitization, and downregulation are important factors in poor responders.
## Receptors

- **Types**:
	- **G Protein-Coupled Receptors**:
		- **Alpha-1 Receptors**: High concentration in vascular smooth muscle; activation increases peripheral vascular resistance and venous return, and has some inotropic effect on cardiac ventricular muscle.
		- **Alpha-2 Receptors**: Mostly involved in negative feedback mechanisms, lowering blood pressure.
		- **Beta-1 Receptors**: Found in atrial and ventricular cardiac muscle; stimulation results in positive inotropy, chronotropy, and lusitropy, increasing cardiac output but also myocardial work and oxygen demand.
		- **Beta-2 Receptors**: Predominantly in atria; stimulation increases chronotropy with less inotropic effect, causes vasodilation in skeletal muscle arteriolar beds, decreases peripheral vascular resistance, and is targeted in bronchospasm and premature labor treatments.
		- **Beta-3 Receptors**: Enhance lipolysis and thermogenesis, involved in poorly understood negative feedback mechanisms, and may decrease inotropy.
		- **D1 Receptors**: Found in renal vascular bed for vasodilation regulation; involved in extrapyramidal activity centrally.
		- **D2 Receptors**: Inhibit norepinephrine release peripherally, reduce pituitary hormone output centrally.

## Types of Catecholamines

### Naturally Occurring Catecholamines

#### Dopamine

- **Mechanism**: Acts both directly and indirectly.
	- **Indirect Action**: Enters sympathetic nerve terminals, displacing norepinephrine from storage vesicles, causing an adrenergic effect if norepinephrine stores are not depleted.
	- **Direct Action**: Binds to dopamine receptors at doses around 5 µg/kg/min. At doses up to 10-20 µg/kg/min, it stimulates β1 receptors, increasing heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output. At higher doses (>20 µg/kg/min), α effects predominate, causing peripheral vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance and venous return.
- **Clinical Use**: Described as a general inotrope-vasopressor, but its wide and unpredictable dosage range and reliance on indirect mechanisms make it suboptimal. It is a potent emetogenic and suppresses prolactin (impairing immunity) and TSH release.
- **Renal Effects**: The "renoprotective" benefits of dopamine have been disproven; increased urine output is due to its diuretic effect, not improved renal perfusion. It may worsen renal outcomes by causing maldistribution of blood flow from the renal medulla to the cortex.
#### Norepinephrine

- **Structure**: Differs from dopamine by an additional hydroxyl group on the ethylamine sidechain, making it a direct-acting drug with high affinity for α receptors and moderate affinity for β1 receptors, with minimal β2 effect.
- **Effects**: Potent vasoconstrictor via α1 agonism and mild inotrope via moderate β1 effect.
- **Clinical Use**: Agent of choice in distributive shock states, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis.
#### Epinephrine

- **Structure**: Formed from norepinephrine by adding a methyl group on the terminal amine, increasing affinity for both β1 and β2 receptors.
- **Effects**:
	- At lower doses, it acts predominantly as a β agonist and inotrope with some vasopressor action.
	- At higher doses (~1 µg/kg/min), α1 vasopressor activity dominates, but it is less potent than norepinephrine due to β2-mediated vasodilation.
- **Clinical Use**: Commonly used globally; positive chronotropic and inotropic effects increase cardiac workload and arrhythmogenicity, posing risks for patients with ischemic heart disease.
- **Metabolic Effects**: Increases plasma glucose by stimulating glycogenolysis, lipolysis, and gluconeogenesis, and affects insulin secretion.
- **Resuscitation**: Recommended at 1 mg every 2-4 minutes in cardiac arrest to function as a pure vasopressor, directing blood supply to vital organs.
### Synthetic Catecholamines

#### Isoprenaline

- **Mechanism**: Pure β agonist, favored for its chronotropic effects (useful in chemical pacing of bradycardias and denervated hearts) and inotrope-vasodilator action (useful postoperatively in pediatric cardiac patients unable to tolerate increased afterload).
#### Dobutamine

- **Structure**: Resembles dopamine but with a large hydrocarbon tail, making it direct-acting and increasing β receptor selectivity.
- **Effects**:
	- Inotropic effect at β1 receptors.
	- Afterload-reducing vasodilatory effect at β2 receptors in skeletal muscle vascular beds.
	- Increases atrioventricular conduction, may precipitate arrhythmias, or increase ventricular response rate in atrial fibrillation or flutter.
- **Clinical Use**: Treats low cardiac output states in heart failure and cardiac surgery (1-20 µg/kg/min). Also used for cardiac stress testing as an alternative to exercise.
#### Phenylephrine

- **Structure**: Lacks a hydroxyl group from the benzene ring, making it a pure α agonist.
- **Effects**: Increases systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure; less potent than adrenaline and requires higher doses (50-100 µg IV boluses).
- **Clinical Use**: Used with caution in relative bradycardia or decreased inotropic states to avoid precipitating acute cardiac failure.
#### Ephedrine

- **Origin**: Naturally occurring stimulant in Ephedra plants, synthesized for clinical use.
- **Mechanism**: Lipid-soluble, acts indirectly by releasing norepinephrine, leading to rapid depletion of stored norepinephrine.
- **Effects**: Mild increase in inotropy and vasoconstriction with IV boluses of 5-10 mg; longer duration of action due to resistance to MAO and COMT degradation.
- **Limitations**: Ineffective after repeated doses or in patients with depleted norepinephrine stores.
#### Amphetamines

- **Structure**: Benzene ring without a hydroxyl group, highly lipid-soluble, penetrates the blood-brain barrier.
- **Mechanism**: Displaces catecholamines from neuronal storage vesicles, causing central release of large amounts of catecholamines.
- **Use**: Originally developed for appetite suppression and mood disorder medication, now mostly drugs of abuse.
#### Phosphodiesterase (PDE) Inhibitors

- **Mechanism**: Positive inotropes that increase intracellular cAMP and cGMP by preventing their degradation, useful in cardiac failure with β receptor downregulation.
- **Example**: Milrinone, a selective PDE III inhibitor, increases cardiac contractility, enhances left ventricular relaxation, and reduces peripheral and pulmonary vascular resistance.
#### Digoxin

- **Mechanism**: Increases contractility by binding to Na+-K+-ATPase in cardiac myocytes, increasing intracellular calcium availability.
- **Effects**: Modest increase in contractility.
#### Levosimendan

- **Mechanism**: Myocardial calcium sensitizer and inodilator.
- **Effects**: Improves contractility without increasing intracellular calcium or cAMP, avoiding increased myocardial oxygen demand.
