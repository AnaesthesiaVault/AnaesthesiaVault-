# Pancreatitis

## Introduction
- Inflammatory disorder of the pancreas with an estimated incidence of 10–40 per 100,000 per year.
- **Mild acute pancreatitis:**
  - Accounts for 80% of cases.
  - Self-limiting, usually resolves with simple supportive management in 3–5 days.
- **Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP):**
  - Defined by the Atlanta Symposium as acute pancreatitis associated with organ dysfunction or local/regional complications.
  - Most deaths from SAP result from sepsis and multiorgan failure.
  - Mortality in patients with infected pancreatic necrosis is 25–30%, compared with 10–12% in those with sterile necrosis.

## Aetiology and Pathogenesis
- **Causes:**
  - 70% due to alcohol or gallstones.
- **Pathogenesis:**
  - Originates from inappropriate release and activation of proteases from acinar cells.
  - Proteases cause direct pancreatic tissue damage and induce an acute inflammatory response.
  - Neutrophil polymorphs (NPM) and macrophages infiltrate the pancreas, releasing proteases, free radicals, and cytokines, worsening tissue damage and inflammation.
  - Pancreatic proteases in the bloodstream can activate NPM and macrophages, causing systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ damage.

## Diagnosis
### Clinical
- Severe constant epigastric pain radiating to the back and flanks, and vomiting.
- Signs may include pyrexia, abdominal distension, and peritonism.
- Classical signs:
  - Discolouration of the flanks (Grey-Turner’s sign)
  - Peri-umbilicus (Cullen’s sign)
  - Inguinal ligament (Fox’s sign)
  - These signs are not always seen and result from retroperitoneal haemorrhage tracking along tissue planes.
- Symptoms and signs of end-organ involvement may be evident, including respiratory distress, shock, oliguria, jaundice, and delirium. SAP may also present painlessly.

### Biochemical
#### Amylase
- Serum amylase level >3 times the normal upper range (300 IU/L) supports the diagnosis of pancreatitis.
- Serum amylase rises quickly in the first 12 hours, returning to baseline within 3–5 days.
- Amylase is cleared by the kidneys with a serum half-life of ~2 hours, thus a single peak may be missed.
- Hyperamylasaemia may be caused by bowel perforation, obstruction or ischaemia, fallopian tube pathology, diabetic ketoacidosis, and pneumonia or neoplasm, particularly when associated with renal failure.

#### Lipase
- Preferred assay when available.
- Lipase levels increase for up to 14 days after the onset of pancreatitis and are more sensitive and specific than amylase.
- A cut-off value of serum lipase of 600 IU/L or ≥3 times the upper limit of normal.

#### Metabolic Derangements
- Acidaemia, uraemia, increased creatinine, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and hyperglycaemia.

#### Other
- Liver enzyme derangement (transaminitis and hyperbilirubinaemia), and haematological disturbance (anaemia, neutrophilia, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy).

### Imaging
#### Abdominal X-ray
- **Findings:** Ileus, loss of psoas shadow, sentinel loop, pancreatic calcification, and calcified gallstones.

#### Chest X-ray
- **Findings:** Pleural effusions (usually on left) and pulmonary infiltrates.

#### Chest US
- **Findings:** Visualization of pleural effusion; guided drainage for diagnosis or treatment of respiratory failure.

#### Abdominal US
- **Findings:** Superior to CT at detecting stones in the gallbladder or biliary duct; may be difficult to visualize pancreas, especially in the presence of ileus; free peritoneal fluid.

#### Endoultrasonography
- **Findings:** Combination of endoscopy and high-frequency US; useful if abdominal US/CT fail to detect CBD stones; useful when CT/MRI are not available/feasible.

#### Renal Tract US
- **Findings:** If oliguric, to rule out obstruction/pyelonephrosis.

#### Contrast-enhanced CT
- **Findings:** Contrast deficit indicating necrosis, local pathology (e.g., abscess, acute fluid collections); can guide interventional procedures (FNAB and drain placement).

#### MRI/MRCP
- **Findings:** Useful in stable patients in whom CT contrast is contraindicated; can delineate necrotic areas; excellent for assessing biliary tree.

#### Angiography
- **Findings:** Haemorrhage localization and guided endovascular management.

#### CT / MRI / US Findings
- Pancreatic enlargement, inflammation, fat strands, fluid collections, retroperitoneal gas (Balthazar index).

### Revised Atlanta Classification 2012
#### Grade of Severity
- **Mild:** No organ failure; no local or systemic complications.
- **Moderate:** Transient organ failure (resolves within 48 hours); local or systemic complications without persistent organ failure.
- **Severe:** Persistent organ failure (persists >48 hours); single or multiple organ failure.

### Ranson's Criteria for Pancreatitis-Associated Mortality
#### At Admission
- Age >55 years
- WBCs >16,000/mm³
- Glucose >200 mg/dL
- LDH >350 IU/L
- AST >250 SF units

#### Within 48 Hours of Admission
- Hematocrit fall >10%
- BUN rise >5 mg/dL
- Calcium <8 mg/dL
- PaO₂ <60 mm Hg
- Base deficit >4 mEq/L
- Fluid sequestration >6 L

#### Substitute if Gallstone Induced Admission
- Age >70 years
- WBCs >18,000/mm³
- Glucose >220 mg/dL
- LDH >400 IU/L
- AST >250 SF units

#### Number of Criteria and Associated Mortality Rate
- 0-3: 1%
- 3-4: 15%
- 5-6: 40%
- >7: 100%

## Management
- Approximately 50% of patients with SAP will have organ failure.

### Indications for Admission to ICU
- Ongoing need for fluid resuscitation.
- Age >70 years.
- Body mass index >30 kg/m².
- Presence of indicators of more severe disease:
  - Necrosis of over 30% of the pancreas.
  - Pleural effusions.
  - ≥3 of Ranson’s criteria present.
  - CRP >150 mg/dL at 48 hours.

### Treatment
1. **Removing or Treating the Precipitant**
   - Gallstones: ERCP only if concurrent acute cholangitis (indicated within 72 hours of symptom onset).
   - Surgery for:
	 - Relieving biliary obstruction.
	 - Minimizing regional and distal organ damage.
	 - Removing infected intraand extra-pancreatic necrosis.

2. **Supportive Care**
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation: 5-10 mL/kg/hr isotonic crystalloid (if tolerated) within 24 hours, then assess dynamic indices.
   - Analgesia: Opiates / epidural.
   - Organ support: Ventilation / inotropes / RRT. Monitor abdominal pressures.
   - General: PPI, VTE prophylaxis, glycaemic control.

3. **Early Nutrition**
   - Mild: Oral, low-fat, solid diet once abdominal pain and N/V settle.
   - PN < EN: If inadequate - add PN after 48 hours (ESPEN) or 7 days (ASPEN).
   - NG = NJ (smaller volumes).

4. **Managing Complications**
   - Necrotic collections: Use antibiotics only if demonstrated on imaging and patient is deteriorating; drainage if no improvement.
   - Other complications: Multi-organ failure, ARDS, abdominal compartment syndrome, pleural effusions, portal vein thrombosis, haemorrhage, fistulae.
