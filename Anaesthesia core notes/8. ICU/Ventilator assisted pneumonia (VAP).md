# Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) in Adults

## Introduction

### Definition
- **VAP**: A type of hospital-acquired pneumonia that occurs more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation.
  - **Classifications**:
	- **Early onset**: Within the first 96 hours of mechanical ventilation (MV).
	- **Late onset**: More than 96 hours after initiation of MV, often due to multidrug-resistant pathogens.

### Incidence
- VAP typically develops 5-7 days after initiation of MV.
- Mortality rate: 24%-76%.

### Pathophysiology
- Patients are unable to clear secretions effectively.
- Normal oral flora proliferate, passing along the tracheal tube, forming an antibiotic-resistant biofilm, reaching the lower airways.
- Critically ill patients have impaired immune responses, leading to pneumonia.

## Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

### Insertion of Endotracheal Tube (ETT) for Invasive Mechanical Ventilation

- **Risk Factors**: Respiratory failure, immunocompromised state, poor swallowing ability, weakened respiratory muscles, chronic disease.
- **Mechanisms**:
  - Paralytics and sedatives inhibit cough reflex.
  - Damage to cilia on epithelial cells during insertion.
  - Reduced mucociliary clearance.
  - Introduction of pathogenic microbes during intubation.
  - Positive pressure drives microbes downward.
  - Accumulation of secretions with microbes.

### Development of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)

- **Occurs**: >48-72 hours after intubation.
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Microbial colonization inside ETT.
  - Biofilm development on ETT.
  - Microaspirations of subglottic and gastric contents.
  - Introduction of oropharyngeal microbes during intubation.
  - Desensitization of pharyngeoglottal adduction reflex.
  - Reflux of gastric contents.
  - Microbes descend airway and infect lungs.
- **Clinical Findings**:
  - Fever/rigors.
  - Increased white blood cell count.
  - Septic shock.
  - Sepsis.
  - Pleural effusion on chest X-ray.
  - Lung consolidation on chest X-ray.
  - Positive microbial culture from sputum.

## Risk Factors

- Increasing age (>55 years).
- Chronic lung disease.
- Aspiration/microaspiration from supine position.
- Chest or upper abdominal surgery.
- Previous antibiotic therapy, especially broad-spectrum.
- Reintubation or prolonged intubation.
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- Frequent ventilator circuit changes.
- Polytrauma.
- Prolonged paralysis.
- Premorbid conditions: malnutrition, renal failure, anemia.

### Risk Factors for MDR-VAP

- Intravenous antibiotic use within the previous 90 days.
- Septic shock at the time of VAP.
- ARDS preceding the development of VAP.
- More than 5 days of hospitalization prior to VAP.
- Acute renal replacement therapy prior to VAP.

## Pathophysiology

- Presence of ETT or tracheostomy interferes with normal respiratory tract functions (cough and mucociliary action).
- Reduced consciousness impairs voluntary clearance of secretions, leading to pooling in the oropharynx.
- Macroaspiration and microaspiration of contaminated oropharyngeal secretions rich in pathogens.
- Proliferation of normal oral flora, forming an antibiotic-resistant biofilm reaching the lower airways.
- Critically unwell patients exhibit impaired immune responses, leading to pneumonia.
- **Early-onset VAP**: Caused by antibiotic-sensitive bacteria such as Haemophilus and Streptococcus.
- **Late-onset VAP**: Caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

## Prevention

- Minimize time on ventilator: Early weaning protocol, regular sedation breaks.
- Appropriate semi-recumbent positioning (30°-45°) reduces micro-aspiration of gastric contents.
- Avoid stress ulcer prophylaxis raising gastric pH, which is detrimental to innate immunological protection.
- Use of subglottic suction ports for anticipated ventilation >72 hours.
- Maintain endotracheal tube airway cuff pressure at 20-30 cm H2O and use of positive end-expiratory pressure.
- Regular oral care and hygiene to reduce dental plaque colonization with pathogens.
- Silver-coated ETTs show promise in reducing VAP risk due to their broad-spectrum antibiotic properties.

### VAP Prevention Bundle

#### Reducing Aspiration

- Nurse in a semirecumbent position (30°-45°).
- Maintain tracheal tube cuff pressure >20 cm H2O.
- Subglottic tube insertion for mechanical ventilation >72 hours.
- Avoid unnecessary endotracheal tube changes.

#### Optimizing Patient's Microbial Ecology

- Stop stress ulcer prophylaxis in low-risk patients.
- Basic oral hygiene.
- Infection control (e.g., hand hygiene).
- Avoid unnecessary circuit changes.

#### Minimizing Duration of Mechanical Ventilation

- Daily sedation breaks.
- Daily assessment for extubation.

#### Optimizing Unit Microbial Ecology

- Monitor VAP rates.
- Local input from Microbiology regarding antimicrobial selection and resistance patterns.

### Interventions and Evidence

1. **Use Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation:**
   - For COPD and congestive heart failure (High).
2. **Minimize Sedation:**
   - Moderate.
3. **Daily Sedation Vacation:**
   - High.
4. **Assess Readiness to Intubate Daily:**
   - High.
5. **Daily Spontaneous Breathing Trial with Sedation Turned Off:**
   - High.
6. **Facilitate Early Mobility:**
   - Moderate.
7. **Endotracheal Tubes with Subglottic Suction Ports if Intubation >48-72 Hours is Anticipated:**
   - Moderate.
8. **Change Ventilator Circuit Only if Visibly Soiled or Malfunctioning:**
   - High.
9. **Elevate Head of Bed to 30-45 Degrees:**
   - Low.

## Diagnosis

- VAP presents with symptoms: fever, purulent respiratory secretions, rising inflammatory markers, respiratory distress, and worsening respiratory parameters.
- Chest X-ray for every patient exhibiting VAP signs; send respiratory secretions for Gram stain, culture, and sensitivity.
  - A normal chest X-ray prompts consideration of alternative diagnoses.
  - Postmortem studies show only 43% confirmation of VAP diagnosis in patients with clinical and radiographic evidence.
- Inflammatory markers such as procalcitonin and C-reactive protein lack sensitivity and specificity.

## Treatment

- Treatment of VAP relies on knowledge of common pathogens, patient risk factors (e.g., immunosuppression, underlying respiratory condition), and previous microbiology specimens.
- Empirical treatment should include antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative bacilli.
- Timely administration of antibiotics is crucial.
- De-escalate antibiotics based on microbiology results, with cessation after 7 days if clinical and biochemical markers improve.

# Ventilation Targets and VILI

## Ventilation Targets and VILI

### Introduction

There has been a paradigm shift in critical care from treating ARDS and lung injuries to preventing lung injury. Positive pressure ventilation triggers pathophysiological mechanisms leading to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) even in healthy lungs. The cyclical opening and closing of respiratory units at high pressures or volumes damages the alveolar capillary membrane and extracellular matrix, inducing mechanotransduction (the process whereby physical stimuli are converted into biochemical signals and inflammatory mediators). Recognizing that normal lungs may benefit from lung-protective ventilation is crucial, as any positive pressure ventilation can be harmful. This section focuses on minimizing postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), indicative of lung injury.

### How VILI is Caused

The concept of lung stress and strain has been known for around 20 years. Understanding these mechanical engineering concepts is crucial for grasping the pathophysiological processes underlying VILI.

**Stress and Strain in Mechanics:**
- **Stress:** The tension across a structure (trans-structural tension), expressed as the force per unit area. High levels of stress disrupt cell functioning, releasing inflammatory mediators and metalloproteinases, damaging the alveoli. In pulmonary mechanics, stress relates to the entire lung, termed transpulmonary pressure.
  
  **Transpulmonary Pressure (P<sub>L</sub>):**
  P_L = static airway pressure - pleural pressure
  Simplified as:
  P_L = \Plateau pressure - pleural pressure

### Ventilation Mechanics

Pleural pressure is difficult to measure; average values are usually obtained from oesophageal balloons or transducers.

**Ventilation and Transpulmonary Pressure (P<sub>L</sub>):**
- Ventilation requires P<sub>L</sub> to create an air flow gradient. This can be achieved through:
  - **Positive pressure ventilation:** Increases airway/plateau pressure.
  - **Negative pressure ventilation:** Lowers pleural pressure.

High plateau pressures or low pleural pressures increase P<sub>L</sub>, stressing the lung parenchyma and causing VILI.

**Variations in Transpulmonary Pressures:**
- Influenced by factors like lung elastic recoil, chest wall compliance, intraabdominal pressure, gravity, lung areas with altered compliance, etc.
- **Shearing Forces:** Mechanical stress from neighboring pockets of lung parenchyma with different compliance moving together.
  - Unequal inflation leads to abnormal interactions, applying mechanical stress, causing mechanotransduction, VILI, or lung rupture.
  - Minimizing junctional interfaces by recruiting collapsed lung tissue may reduce stress.

**Strain:**
- **Mechanical Strain:** Ratio of the increase in length of a structure to its resting length. Calculated as the change in lung volume in response to applied stress (tidal volume) relative to functional residual capacity (FRC).
- Strain= tidal volume/functional residual capacity
  - High tidal volumes increase strain, destructive forces on the lung parenchyma, and reduce FRC, increasing stress. Reducing tidal volume and using PEEP can reduce lung strain.

### How to Do No Harm

Four lung-protective ventilatory strategies have emerged for ARDS patients (ARDSnet Investigators 2000):

1. **Limit Tidal Volumes (V<sub>T</sub>)**
2. **Limit Plateau Pressures (P<sub>plat</sub>)**
3. **Use of Higher PEEP**
4. **Use of Recruitment Manoeuvres (RM)**

#### Limiting Tidal Volume
- **Clinical Trials:**
  - Studies show benefit of lower V<sub>T</sub> in patients with normal lungs:
	- 6-8 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW) with PEEP 6-8 cmH<sub>2</sub>O.
	- Higher V<sub>T</sub> with zero PEEP increases lung damage.

#### Limiting Plateau Pressures
- **ARDSnet Recommendation:**
  - Plateau pressure should not exceed 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O to avoid barotrauma.

#### Higher PEEP
- **PEEP:** Prevents lung injury by stabilizing alveoli, preventing atelectasis.
  - Too high PEEP may cause over-distension, while too low PEEP may cause de-recruitment.
  - **PROVE Network (2014):**
	- No difference in PPCs between high and low PEEP groups, but high PEEP may worsen compliance.

#### Recruitment Manoeuvres
- **Goal:** Restore lung aeration by increasing transpulmonary pressures.
  - Evidence for routine use is limited; should be reserved for overcoming atelectasis.

### Conclusion
- VILI occurs due to the mechanical concepts of stress and strain.
- Intraoperative lung protective ventilatory strategies are crucial.
  - **Key Strategies:**
	- Limit V<sub>T</sub> to 6 ml/kg PBW.
	- Limit P<sub>plat</sub> to 14 cmH<sub>2</sub>O.
	- Use higher PEEP cautiously.
