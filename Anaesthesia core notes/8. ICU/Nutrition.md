# Nutrition in ICU

## Feeding in ICU Summary from Prof Von Raden

### Default Target
- **Goal**: Full daily caloric and protein requirements delivered by 72 hours post-admission.
  - **Major Burns**: Goal for full feeds within 24 hours; initiate feeding within 6 hours.
  - **Consultant Decision**: Longer time to full feed for well-nourished patients not in a significant catabolic state.

### Initiation of Feeding
- **Within 24 Hours**:
  - Many patients may not tolerate feeds in the first 24 hours due to conditions such as stress gastroparesis, major trauma, surgery, or shock.
  - Initial feeding attempts can be deferred up to 24 hours.
  - Active feeding attempts must be made after 24 hours.

### Physiological Route Preference
- **Order of Preference**: Eating > NG tube feed > NJ tube feed > TPN.
- **TPN Addition**: Expected if full requirements cannot be met via enteral feed within 72 hours.
  - Note: This differs from current ESPEN guidelines due to higher baseline malnutrition incidence.

### Chronically Malnourished Patients
- **Review PO4 Levels**: Before and during feed initiation.
  - Limit calories if PO4 < 0.7 mmol/L until actively replaced.
  - Hypophosphatemia + calorie load = refeeding syndrome risk.

### Unsuccessful Enteral Feeding Attempts
- **Review Potential Issues**:
  - **Simple Gastroparesis**: Consider prokinetic agent if differential diagnoses are eliminated.
  - **Small Bowel Ileus**: Exclude causative pathologies such as:
	- Electrolyte abnormalities
	- Intra-abdominal sepsis
	- Acalculous cholecystitis
	- Occult leak
	- Obstruction
	- Gut atrophy

### Enteral Feeding Strategy
- **Gastric**: Use Aspiration Regime as per Department of Dietetics.
- **Post-pyloric**: Escalate to 100% over 12 hours, monitoring for abdominal distension.
  - 25% - 4 hours - 50% - 4 hours–75% - 4 hours–100%
  - Follow Department of Dietetics protocols for choice of enteral feeds.
- **Feeding Types**:
  - **Gastric Feeding (No Atrophy Concern)**: Standard enteral feed, with or without fibre.
  - **Post-pyloric or Gastric Feeding (Mild Atrophy Concern)**: Semi-elemental feed.
  - **Significant Atrophy Concern**: Near-elemental feed at low volume for 48 hours.

### TPN Choice
- Consult with Department of Dietetics.
  - **"Renal" Formula**: For patients with renal disease or fluid volume limitations.

### Glutamine Requirement
- Consider IV or enteral glutamine; discuss with Department of Dietetics.

### Stool Passage
- Expected within 48 hours of full enteral feeding.
  - Manage constipation actively if not occurring:
	- Lactulose
	- Enemas
	- Decompaction

### Diarrhoea Considerations
- **Causes**:
  - Infection (e.g., Clostridium difficile)
  - Malabsorption (requiring enterocyte re-feeding strategy)
  - Overflow past partial obstruction
  - Osmotic effect from feed
- **Constipating Agents** (e.g., codeine) may be considered if diarrhoea is physiologically disabling, and infection and partial obstruction are excluded.
  - Discuss daily with Registered Dietician.

## Introduction
- ICU patients experience rapid nutritional status deterioration post-admission due to severe catabolism from stress-related and proinflammatory cytokines and hormones, even if initially well-nourished.
- Within 10 days, patients can lose 10-25% of body protein, especially those with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.

## Pathophysiology of Metabolic Dysfunction in ICU Patients

### Differences from Starvation
- **Major Insult**: Triggers massive inflammatory response including metabolic changes.
- **Initial Shock Phase**: Tissue hypoxia leads to decreased energy expenditure.
- **Acute Phase**: Increased metabolic rate and energy expenditure (25-50% above resting energy expenditure).
  - **Glucose**: Main energy source; body stores are limited (mainly liver glycogen, rapidly depleted).
  - **Insulin Resistance**: Leads to increased blood glucose, which may impair immune response.

### Energy Provision
- **Structural Protein Breakdown**: Massive breakdown of skeletal muscle protein to provide energy, leading to long-term weakness and disability (part of post-intensive care syndrome - PICS).
- **Liver Function**: Produces different proteins, imports albumin, increases acute phase proteins (e.g., clotting factors, opsonins). Albumin levels drop in acute illness, not reflecting nutritional status.
- **Regulating Hormones and Cytokines**:
  - Cortisol
  - Glucagon
  - Catecholamines
  - TNF
  - IL-1
  - IL-6
- **Starvation Response**: Metabolic response in ICU patients differs from starvation, which includes:
  - Decreased metabolic rate
  - Consumption of fat stores
  - Protein conservation
- **Acute Phase Nutrition**: Can only reduce protein catabolism until recovery begins and the patient becomes anabolic.

## Nutritional Requirements

### Energy
- **Variation**: Energy expenditure varies among patients and from day to day.
- **Early Acute Phase**: Providing full requirements increases complications; hypocaloric feeding in the first few days reduces hyperglycemia and improves GI tolerance.
  - ESPEN recommends no more than 70% of requirements in early acute phase.
- **Full Energy Requirements**: 25-30 Kcal/Kg Ideal Body Weight (IBW), calculated using height and sex.
  - **Enteral Feeds**: Quoted as total calories.
  - **Parenteral Solutions**: Quoted as protein-free calories.
- **Complex Formulae**: Harris-Benedict equation can be used to calculate resting energy expenditure with a 25% stress factor.
- **Indirect Calorimetry**: Metabolic monitor attached to the ventilator measures energy expenditure and respiratory quotient from oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production.
- **Non-nutritional Energy Sources**: Glucose and propofol infusions should be considered in calculations.
- **Obese Patients**: Require additional nutrients; energy and protein prescriptions based on adjusted body mass (ideal body mass plus one-third of the difference between actual and ideal mass).

### Carbohydrate and Fat
- Both should provide non-protein energy.
  - **Parenteral Solutions**: Only glucose is used.
  - **Enteral Feeds**: Contain a variety of starches.
  - **Lipid**: Should make up 30-50% of energy supply, including a blend of medium chain triglycerides, monoand omega-3 unsaturated lipids.
- **Blood Glucose Levels**: Maintain 6-10 mmol using insulin infusion or reduced CHO intake.

### Protein
- Higher requirements in critically ill.
  - Current recommendation: 1.3 grams/Kg IBW.
  - Not restricted in early acute phase.
  - Not reduced in acute renal failure.
  - Reduced in severe hepatic failure.

### Glutamine
- Previously thought beneficial; high doses in multiple organ failure caused harm.
  - May benefit trauma and burns patients but not administered to hepatic or renal failure patients.

### Vitamins
- Recommended daily allowance included in most enteral feeds.
  - **Vitamin C**: Antioxidant; large study showed no benefit in multiple organ failure. Modest doses may benefit; mega doses in septic shock not supported by prospective RCTs.
  - **Vitamin D**: Measure levels and administer a single dose of 50,000 IU if low.
  - **Thiamine**: Administer to patients with a history of heavy alcohol intake or at risk of refeeding syndrome.
  - **Trace Elements**: Supplement in patients on parenteral nutrition. Monitor plasma zinc in long-term ICU patients, especially with high gastrointestinal fluid losses; supplement if low.
  - **Dietary Fiber**: Important for bowel function and slowing CHO absorption. May reduce diarrhea and constipation incidence. Introduce fiber-containing feeds once bowel motility is established.

### Water and Electrolytes
- Daily adjustments related to fluctuating requirements. Generally, ICU patients need potassium, magnesium, and phosphate replacement; sodium and water restriction.
  - **Fluid Management**: After resuscitation, use fluid restriction and diuretics to improve pulmonary function.
  - **Over-restriction**: Causes hypernatremia; may need additional water temporarily.
  - **Renal Failure**: Low potassium feeds required.
  - **High Upper GI Losses**: May require increased sodium intake.

### Daily Electrolyte Requirements (mmol/kg/day)
- Sodium: 1-2
- Potassium: 0.7-1.0
- Calcium: 0.1
- Magnesium: 0.1
- Chloride: 1-2
- Phosphate: 0.4

### Macronutrient Requirements
- Protein: 1.5 g/kg/day (5.3 kcal/g)
- Lipid: 9 kcal/g. 1g/kg/day
- Carbohydrate: 4 kcal/g. 7g/kg/day
- Nitrogen: Approximately 14 g/day
- Energy: 25-40kcal/kg/day

## Assessment Tool: Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST)
- Uses BMI, weight loss, and acute disease to identify obesity, nutrition risk, and malnourishment.

## Malnutrition Risk Assessment and Management

### Risk Assessment Steps

1. **BMI Score**:
 - > 20 (or >30 if obese): 0
 - 18.5-20: 1
 - <18.5: 2
 - If unable to obtain height/weight, use alternative measurements or subjective criteria.

2. **Weight Loss Score** (Unplanned weight loss in past 3-6 months):
   - <5%: 0
   - 5-10%: 1
   - > 10%: 2

3. **Acute Disease Effect Score**:
   - If acutely ill and no nutritional intake for >5 days: 2

4. **Overall Risk of Malnutrition**:
   - Add scores from steps 1-3 to calculate total risk.

5. **Management Guidelines**:
   - **Score 0 (Low Risk)**:
	 - Routine clinical care
	 - Repeat screening: weekly (hospital), monthly (care home), annually (community, special groups e.g., aged >75 years)
   - **Score 1 (Medium Risk)**:
	 - Observe
	 - Document dietary intake for 3 days
	 - Repeat screening: weekly (hospital), monthly (care home), every 2-3 months (community)
   - **Score ≥2 (High Risk)**:
	 - Treat
	 - Refer to dietitian/nutritional support team
	 - Set goals to improve nutritional intake
	 - Monitor and review care plan: weekly (hospital), monthly (care home and community)
   - **All Risk Categories**:
	 - Treat underlying condition
	 - Record malnutrition risk category
	 - Follow local policy

### Obesity
- Record presence of obesity
- Manage underlying conditions before obesity treatment

## The NUTrition Risk in the Critically Ill (NUTRIC Score)
- Conceptual model linking starvation, inflammation, nutritional status, and outcomes. The modified NUTRIC (mNUTRIC) score excludes IL-6.

# Perioperative Nutrition

## Pre-operative Nutrition
- **Assessment for Malnutrition**: Evaluate nutritional status preoperatively.
- **Nutritional Support**: Provide support under the guidance of a registered dietitian.
- **Normal Food Intake**: Allow normal food intake up to the evening before surgery.
- **Bowel Cleansing for Intestinal Surgery**: If required, provide nutritional supplementation to minimize the fasting period.

## Intra-operative Nutrition
- **Clear Fluids**: Allow clear fluids up to 2 hours preoperatively.
- **Carbohydrate Loading**: Administer preoperative carbohydrate loading.

## Post-operative Nutrition
- **Early Oral Intake**: Encourage oral intake within 24 hours and early mobilization.
- **Sip Feeds**: Use sip feeds if nutritional needs are not met with hospital feed.
- **Enteral Feeds**: Utilize enteral feeds (NG/PEG/Jejunostomy) if the patient is unable to ingest orally or is obstructed.
- **Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)**: Employ TPN if the jejunum is inaccessible or in cases of intestinal failure.

# Other Considerations

## Biggest Predictor of Clinical Outcomes in Critical Care with Regards to Nutrition
- **Body Composition and Outcomes**: Lean body mass is significantly associated with clinical outcomes.
- **Nutritional Risk Assessment**: The Modified NUTrition Risk in Critically Ill (mNUTRIC) score helps identify patients who benefit from higher nutritional intake. Caloric restriction decreases mortality in refeeding syndrome.
- **Gastric Residual Volume Monitoring**: Current ASPEN/SCCM guidelines recommend not to routinely use gastric residual volume (GRV) measurements or not to hold enteral feeding for GRV less than 500 ml in the absence of other signs of intolerance. The Canadian Critical Care Nutrition Clinical Practice Guidelines suggest considering GRVs of either 250 or 500 ml to optimize enteral delivery.
- **Feeding Intolerance and Prokinetics**: Prokinetics can reduce feeding intolerance within 24 hours. However, metoclopramide and erythromycin are associated with tachyphylaxis and are recommended only for short-term use (5–7 days).
- **Enteral vs Parenteral Nutrition**: Enteral nutrition is preferable. Early parenteral nutrition has shown negative effects, especially in low-risk ICU patients. Supplemental parenteral nutrition (SPN) should not be commenced before day 5–8 unless patients are at high nutritional risk (NUTRIC score >5).

### Enteral Feeding
- **Benefits**:
  - Maintains gut immunity.
  - Preserves GI mucosal function and integrity.
  - Less risk of overfeeding.
- **Risks**:
  - Risk of vomiting and diarrhoea.

### Parenteral Feeding
- **Benefits**:
  - Early achievement of nutritional adequacy.
- **Risks**:
  - Higher rates of infection, especially with high nutritional loads.

## Glutamine in the Management of the Septic Patient
- **Role**: Glutamine is involved in numerous metabolic and biochemical processes, but levels are reduced during critical illness.
- **Potential Benefits**: Improves gut mucosal atrophy and permeability, enhances immune cell function, decreases proinflammatory cytokine production, and increases antioxidative capacity.
- **Concerns**: The REDOX trial showed increased mortality in patients with baseline renal dysfunction. Meta-analyses showed benefits in burns (reduced infections and mortality) and trauma (improved wound healing).
- **Recommendations (ESPEN 2019)**:
  - **Enteral Glutamine**: Should be given to burns (>20% TBSA) and critically ill trauma patients, but not to other ICU patients.
  - **Parenteral Glutamine**: Should not be administered to unstable and complex ICU patients, particularly those with liver or renal failure.

## Omega-3 Fatty Acids in the Management of the Septic Patient (ESPEN 2019)
- **Role**: Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and GLA) are eicosanoid precursors that reduce the proinflammatory impact on the immune response.
- **Benefits**: Reduce IL-6, increase IL-10, and improve gas exchange.
- **Recommendations**: High doses of omega-3-enriched enteral nutrition (EN) formula should not be given routinely or by bolus administration but can be administered within nutritional doses.

## Selenium in the Management of the Septic Patient
- **Role**: Low serum selenium is associated with intense inflammation, organ failures, and poor outcomes.
- **High Dose Therapy**: Some meta-analyses suggest high doses may reduce mortality in sepsis, but recent studies (e.g., REDOXS trial) showed no effect. High doses should be avoided in renal failure.
- **Recommendations**: Antioxidants, including selenium, should not be administered as high dose monotherapy without proven deficiency.

## Risks/Benefits Of Glutamine, Fish Oils, and Selenium
- **Glutamine**: Potentially increases protein anabolism, but results are conflicting and not recommended routinely.
- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Not recommended routinely; no effect on mortality but may reduce length of stay (LOS) in septic ICU patients.
- **Selenium**: Not recommended routinely; no effect on mortality but may reduce LOS.

## Calorie Measurement
- **Direct Calorimetry**: Measures body heat production.
- **Indirect Calorimetry**: Measures inspired and expired CO2 and O2.
- **Predictive Equations**: Weight-based equations are 40-75% accurate.
.
# Refeeding Syndrome

## Introduction
- During relative starvation, there is a gradual decrease in main intracellular ions:
  - Potassium
  - Magnesium
  - Phosphate
- Prior to refeeding, blood levels of these electrolytes are normal, but with the reintroduction of nutrition, they drop rapidly.
- The main culprit in refeeding syndrome is phosphate, as low levels can cause muscle weakness and affect neurological function.
  - PO4 < 0.65 mmol/l or a decrease of > 0.16 mmol/l is strongly suggestive of the diagnosis.
- In extreme cases, there may be arrhythmias, seizures, and coma.
- During refeeding, basal metabolic rate increases as does blood glucose level.
  - Phosphate becomes bound to phosphorylated carbohydrates in the liver and muscles.
  - The increase in blood glucose increases the demand for phosphate to form ATP.
  - There is also a decrease in red blood cell 2,3-DPG resulting in reduced oxygen delivery.
  - Thiamine is an essential co-enzyme in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and further steps in glycolytic pathway.

All critically ill patients should have their nutrients introduced gradually and their phosphate, magnesium, and potassium levels closely monitored and aggressively replaced if below normal. In patients at risk of refeeding syndrome, their initial nutrition targets should be calculated on their actual, not ideal body mass.

The NICE guidelines recommend that refeeding is started at no more than 50% of energy requirements in patients who have eaten little or nothing for more than 5 days. The rate can then be increased if no refeeding problems are detected on clinical and biochemical monitoring.

If the syndrome is detected, the rate of feeding should be slowed down, and essential electrolytes should be replenished. The hospital specialist dietetics team should be involved.

## Pathogenesis

### Starvation/Malnutrition

- **Decreased**:
  - Insulin
  - Glycogen stores
  - Glycogenolysis (24-48 hrs)
  - Proteolysis (72 hrs)
  - Lipolysis (48 hrs)
  - Serum K, PO4, Mg
  - Thiamine status
- **Increased**:
  - Glucagon
  - Free fatty acids
  - Free glycerol
  - Ketones

### Rapid Refeeding

- **Increased**:
  - Glucose, fluid, salt, nutrients intake (oral, enteral, parenteral sources)
  - Insulin secretion
  - Synthesis of proteins, ATP, DNA, RNA
- **Electrolyte Shifts**: K, PO4, Mg shift from serum into cells.

### Total Body Depletion
- K, PO4, Mg are depleted during starvation, causing a shift from serum into cells.

### Electrolyte Imbalances

- **Serum Levels**: Decreased K, Mg, Ca due to rapid refeeding, resulting in tetany and changes in action potential threshold.

### Organ Dysfunction

- **Pulmonary Edema**: Fluid overload, Na retention, glucose metabolism, thiamine deficiency.
- **Cardiac Arrhythmias/Arrest**: Changes in serum K, Mg, Ca.
- **CHF, Rhabdomyolysis, ATN, Dyspnea**: Muscle ATP depletion, RBC ATP, and 2,3-DPG depletion.

### Neurological Effects

- **Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome**: Thiamine deficiency.
- **CNS**: Tremors, ataxia, coma, delirium.

### Gastrointestinal Effects

- **GI**: Anorexia, constipation.

### Musculoskeletal Effects

- **MSK**: Weakness, diaphragm weakness.
### ECG Changes

- ECG changes typically occur when serum potassium is < 3 mEq/L and include ST segment sagging, T wave depression, and U wave elevation.
- With marked **hypokalemia**, the T wave becomes progressively smaller and the U wave becomes increasingly larger.

## Patients at Risk

- **Two or more of the following:**
  - BMI less than 18.5 kg/m²
  - Unintentional weight loss >10% within the last 3-6 months (>15%)
  - Little or no nutritional intake for more than 5 days
  - History of alcohol abuse or drugs including insulin, chemotherapy, antacids, or diuretics
  - Critically low levels of phosphate, potassium, and magnesium.

## Risk Assessment and Approach

### Risk Assessment

- **Patients at risk**: Check potassium, calcium, phosphate, magnesium.

### Pre-Feeding

- **Administer**: Thiamine 200-300 mg daily (oral), vitamin B high potency 1-2 tablets 3x daily (or IV vitamin B), multivitamin or trace element supplement once daily.

### Feeding Initiation

- **Start feeding**: 0.0418 MJ/kg/day, slowly increase over 4-7 days.

### Rehydration and Supplementation

- **Potassium**: 2-4 mmol/kg/day
- **Phosphate**: 0.3-0.6 mmol/kg/day
- **Calcium**: 0.2 mmol/kg/day IV or 0.4 mmol/kg/day orally
- **Magnesium**: 0.2 mmol/kg/day

### Monitoring

- **First 2 weeks**: Monitor potassium, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, and adjust treatment as necessary.

### High-Risk Patients

- **Anorexia nervosa, chronic alcoholism, oncology, postoperative patients**
- **Elderly patients**: Comorbidities, decreased physiological reserve
- **Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus**: Electrolyte depletion, diuresis
- **Chronic malnutrition**: Marasmus, prolonged fasting, morbid obesity with weight loss, high stress unfed >7 days, malabsorptive syndrome, long-term use of antacids or diuretics.
#### Recommendations for Phosphate and Magnesium Supplementation

**Phosphate**:

- **Maintenance**: 0.3-0.6 mmol/kg/day orally
- **Mild hypophosphatemia**: 0.3-0.6 mmol/l
- **Moderate hypophosphatemia**: 9 mmol infused IV over 12 hrs
- **Severe hypophosphatemia**: 18 mmol infused IV over 12 hrs

**Magnesium**:

- **Maintenance**: 0.2 mmol/kg/day IV or 0.4 mmol/kg/day orally
- **Mild to moderate hypomagnesemia**: 0.5-0.7 mmol/l, initially 0.5 mmol/kg/day IV over 24 hrs, then 0.25 mmol/kg/day for 5 days IV
- **Severe hypomagnesemia**: <0.5 mmol/l, 24 mmol over 6 hrs IV, then as for mild/moderate

## Prevention

1. Identify high-risk patients.
2. The NICE guidelines recommend that refeeding is started at no more than 50% of energy requirements in patients who have eaten little or nothing for more than 5 days. The rate can then be increased if no refeeding problems are detected on clinical and biochemical monitoring.
3. Nutritional assessment before refeeding is started.
4. All guidelines recommend that vitamin supplementation should be started immediately, before and for the first 10 days of refeeding.
5. Circulatory volume should also be restored.
6. Oral, enteral, or intravenous supplements of potassium, phosphate, calcium, and magnesium should be given unless blood levels are high before refeeding.
