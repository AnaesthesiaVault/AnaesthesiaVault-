# Pain Management in ICU

## General Principles
- **All patients** should receive some form of analgesia.
  - Omission of analgesia must be actively decided upon and repeatedly reviewed.
  - "P.R.N" analgesia is unacceptable except in convalescent patients preparing for discharge.
  
## Multimodal Analgesia
- **Severe pain of all types / visceral pain of any magnitude**: Opioid-based.
  - **Static analgesia**:
	- **Morphine load + infusion** / regular timed bolus: Default for static analgesia.
	- **Sufentanil load + infusion**: For static analgesia in patients with significant renal dysfunction (Morphine 6 glucuronide accumulation leads to prolonged sedation) or where morphine causes excessive bradypnoea.
	- **Tramadol**: Alternative for moderate pain in patients with excessive respiratory depression from Morphine/Fentanyl and who have enteral tolerance.
  - **Dynamic analgesia**:
	- **Fentanyl boluses**: For breakthrough pain/procedures/mobilization (“dynamic analgesia”).
- **All types of pain**: Paracetamol.
  - Intravenous route if no enteral access to reduce opioid use and avoid ventilation.
  - Enteral route for **almost all patients** as soon as enteral feeds established to spare morphine.
	- **Exception**: Liver failure (omit paracetamol if significant liver dysfunction is suspected).
- **Ketamine**:
  - Consider as adjunct in low doses for patients on opioids for more than 12 hours to limit hyperalgesia.
  - Significantly useful in some types of **somatic pain** (e.g., craniotomy, fractures where NSAIDs are contraindicated).
- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for somatic pain**:
  - **Fracture pain** responds best to NSAIDs.
  - **NO NSAIDs if**:
	- Haemodynamically unstable.
	- Dehydrated/not fully resuscitated.
	- Significant renal dysfunction.
	- High risk of bleeding from wounds.
	- Significant thrombocytopaenia/thrombocytopathy.
	- Recent significant history of peptic ulceration.
- **Clonidine**:
  - Useful as adjunctive analgesic in many types of pain, especially **neuropathic pain**.
- **Secondary analgesics**:
  - For **neuropathic pain**: amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine.
  - Review with chronic pain specialist.

# Assessment Tools for Pain Management in ICU

## Overview of Assessment Tools

### CPOT (Critically-ill Pain Observation Tool)

- **Criterion and Distinguish Validity**: CPOT has shown strong validity (p < 0.0001).
- **Sensitivity**: 76.5%
- **Specificity**: 70.8%
- **Correlation with Was**: CPOT scores are significantly correlated with Was (p < 0.0001).

### BPS (Behavioral Pain Scale)

- **Criterion and Distinguish Validity**: BPS has shown strong validity (p < 0.0001).
- **Sensitivity**: 62.7%
- **Specificity**: 91.7%
- **Correlation with Was**: BPS scores are significantly correlated with Was (p < 0.0001).

### Combined CPOT and BPS

- **Enhanced Sensitivity**: Combining CPOT and BPS results in better sensitivity (80.4%).

## Was (Visual Analog Scale)

- **Gold Standard**: Was is the gold standard for pain evaluation.
- **Threshold for Pain**: Was ≥ 3 is used to determine patients experiencing pain.

## Goal of Pain Management in ICU

- **Primary Goal**: Patient comfort should be a primary goal in the ICU.
- **Components of Patient Comfort**:
	- Adequate pain control
	- Anxiolysis
	- Prevention and treatment of delirium
## Behavioural Pain Scale (BPS)

## CPOT (Critically-ill Pain Observation Tool)

The CPOT is used to assess pain in critically ill patients based on four indicators:

### Indicators, Descriptions, and Scores
- **Facial Expression**:
  - Relaxed, Neutral: 0
  - Tense: 1
  - Grimacing: 2
- **Body Movement**:
  - Absence of movements: 0
  - Protection: 1
  - Restlessness: 2
- **Muscle Tension**:
  - Relaxed: 0
  - Tense or Rigid: 1
