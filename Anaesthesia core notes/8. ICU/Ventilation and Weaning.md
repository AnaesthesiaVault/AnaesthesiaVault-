# How a Ventilator Works

Ventilators are positive pressure generators that create a positive pressure gradient, allowing air to move into the lungs. This is the opposite of spontaneous breathing, which generates a negative pressure gradient to draw air in.

## Control Modes

Ventilators operate in either pressure control or flow (volume) control modes. Flow and volume controllers behave similarly, as direct control of flow indirectly controls volume and vice versa. This combined approach is referred to as Volume Controlled Ventilation (VCV), with most VCV using flow control.

### Overcoming Resistance

The airflow generated by a ventilator needs to overcome both airway resistance and elastance (lung tissue resistance). Elastance refers to the lung's tendency to recoil and is inversely proportional to compliance.

## Airway Resistance and Compliance

### Resistance

Ohm's Law: Resistance = Pressure / Volume

Using this principle:

- Airway Resistance = (PIP - Plateau Pressure) / Tidal Volume (TV)
- Tidal volume is constant (flow = 1)

**Key Points:**
- Airway resistance is related to the dynamic compliance of the lung.
- Normal airway resistance is usually less than 10 cmH2O.
- Plateau pressure is measured by stopping all airflow on the ventilator (inspiratory pause), indicating the pressure inside the alveolus after inspiration.
- Increased PIP with normal plateau pressure suggests issues such as tube obstruction or bronchospasm (airflow problem).

### Compliance

Boyle's Law: Change in Volume / Change in Pressure

Using this principle:

- Compliance = TV / Driving Pressure
- Driving Pressure = Plateau Pressure - PEEP

**Key Points:**
- Compliance is related to the static compliance of the lung.
- Normal compliance is around 100 ml/cmH2O.
- Increased PIP and plateau pressure suggest issues such as ARDS or atelectasis.

## Phases of Ventilation

### Trigger

The transition from expiration to inspiration. Inspiration begins when the trigger (pressure, flow, volume, or time) reaches a preset value.

- **Time Triggering:** A controlled breath is delivered at preset intervals (patient-independent).
- **Pressure/Flow/Volume Triggering:** The ventilator detects a preset value caused by patient effort, initiating a breath.

### Target

During inspiration, the target variable (pressure, volume, or flow) must reach a specified level before inspiration ends. This does not define the end of inspiration but sets the upper boundary for each breath.

### Cycle

The transition from inspiration to expiration. When the cycle variable (pressure, volume, flow, or time) is reached, inspiration ends, and expiration begins. Expiration is passive.

### Trigger
- Ventilators measure pressure, volume, flow, and time.
- Breaths may be triggered by the patient or the ventilator.
- Controlled mechanical breaths are time-triggered.
- Patient-triggered breaths are initiated by changes in flow or pressure.

### Cycling
- Cycling determines how the ventilator ends inspiration and allows expiration.
- Mandatory breaths are generally time-cycled (PCV) or volume-cycled (VCV).
- Spontaneous supported breaths (PSV) are usually flow-cycled.
- Pressure cycling is now mainly a safety backup.

## Pressure Vs Volume Vs Flow Vs Time-Cycled Ventilators

### Pressure-Cycled Ventilators

Cycle to expiration when airway pressure reaches a predetermined limit. VT and inspiratory time vary with airway resistance and pulmonary and circuit compliance.

### Volume-Cycled Ventilators

Terminate inspiration when a preselected volume is delivered. Exact TV is not always delivered due to circuit compliance and flow measurements.

### Flow-Cycled Ventilators

Monitor inspiratory flow at a preset fixed inspiratory pressure. When the flow reaches a predetermined level (usually 25% of peak inspiratory flow rate), the ventilator cycles to expiration.

### Time-Cycled Ventilators

Cycle to expiration after a predetermined interval elapses from the start of inspiration. VT is the product of the set inspiratory time and inspiratory flow rate.

## Pressure-Controlled Ventilation (PCV) Vs Volume-Controlled Ventilation (VCV)

### Advantages of PCV
- Alveolar pressure is limited and cannot exceed the set inspiratory pressure.
- Lower peak airway pressures for an equivalent TV.
- Higher mean airway pressure, potentially improving oxygenation.
- Improved distribution of ventilation and CO2 elimination.

### Disadvantages of PCV
- Variation in TV.
- High transpulmonary pressure due to vigorous patient effort.

### Pressure Control

With pressure control, inspiratory pressure is chosen by the clinician. Flow in a passive patient is decelerating. Airway pressure is controlled, but the volume delivered depends on respiratory system impedance and inspiratory time.

### Volume Control

With volume control, tidal volume (TV) and inspiratory flow are chosen by the clinician. Delivered volume is controlled, but airway pressure depends on compliance and resistance.

## Hybrid Modes

Modern ventilators can deliver breaths with characteristics of both pressure and volume control, known as dual control or hybrid breaths (e.g., pressure-regulated volume control). These modes combine the theoretical advantages of both pressure and volume control.

# Ventilator Modes

Ventilator modes fall into two broad categories: pressure modes and volume modes. Each mode is characterized by three key features:

- **Trigger (T):** What initiates a breath?
- **Cycle (C):** What ends a breath?
- **Limit (L):** What stops a breath early?

## How Are Modes of Ventilation Defined?

Modes of ventilation are defined by three variables:

1. **Control Variable:** The independent variable (pressure, volume, or flow).
2. **Target Scheme:** A feedback control design to deliver a specific pattern. The most basic is set-point targeting, where a value is set, and the ventilator seeks to deliver it.
3. **Breath Sequence:** Determines whether breaths are mandatory or spontaneous.

### Breath Sequence
- **Controlled:** No patient effort allowed.
- **Assisted Controlled/Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (IMV):** Minimum mandatory breaths are delivered as set by the operator. The patient is allowed to breathe, with fully supported breaths by the ventilator if enough effort is made to trigger the ventilator.
- **Spontaneous (IMV):** The patient is allowed to breathe between mandatory breaths, but these breaths are not supported.
- **Spontaneous Breaths (Pressure Support Ventilation, PSV):** The patient determines the timing and size of the breath.
## Summary of Ventilator Modes

### Pressure Modes
- **Trigger:** Initiated by patient effort or time.
- **Cycle:** Ends when a preset pressure is reached.
- **Limit:** Stops if pressure exceeds a certain level.

### Volume Modes
- **Trigger:** Initiated by patient effort or time.
- **Cycle:** Ends when a preset volume is delivered.
- **Limit:** Stops if volume exceeds a certain level.

### Flow Modes
- **Trigger:** Initiated by patient effort or time.
- **Cycle:** Ends when a preset flow rate is reached.
- **Limit:** Stops if flow rate exceeds a certain level.

### Time Modes
- **Trigger:** Initiated by patient effort or time.
- **Cycle:** Ends after a preset time interval.
- **Limit:** Stops if time exceeds a certain limit.

## Advanced Modes of Ventilation

### Pressure-Regulated Volume Control (PRVC)

PRVC is a smart pressure mode where the operator sets the tidal volume (TV). The ventilator delivers a breath, assesses lung compliance, and adjusts pressure to deliver the set TV based on lung compliance. This mode is suitable for patients who are very cooperative on the ventilator.

- **Volume Guarantee:** Ensures that for all mandatory breaths, the set tidal volume (VT) is applied with the minimum pressure necessary. If resistance (R) or compliance (C) changes, the pressure adapts gradually over a few breaths to restore the set tidal volume (VT).

**How PRVC Works:**
- The first breath delivered is a volume-controlled breath (test breath), with a 'square' flow waveform and a 'shark-fin' pressure waveform visible on the screen.
- The patient’s compliance is determined from this volume breath.
- The inspiratory pressure level is then established for the subsequent breaths.
- If the target volume is overshot, the next breath is delivered at a slightly lower pressure to achieve the target volume.

**Benefits of PRVC:**
- Patients receive consistent tidal volumes regardless of compliance changes due to factors like surgical exposure, patient position, or level of relaxation.

### Airway Pressure Release Ventilation

APRV is a mode of ventilation characterized by alternating high and low airway pressures, designed to keep alveoli open longer and facilitate CO₂ removal by dropping the pressure intermittently. Key settings include:

- **High Pressure (P<sub>high</sub>):** Set to maintain alveolar recruitment.
- **Low Pressure (P<sub>low</sub>):** Set to allow CO₂ removal.
- **Time at High Pressure (T<sub>high</sub>):** Prolonged to ensure alveolar stability.
- **Time at Low Pressure (T<sub>low</sub>):** Shortened to prevent alveolar collapse, typically allowing only 50% to 70% of expiratory flow to provide autoPEEP.

**Initial Settings:**

- Minimum PEEP: 10-12 cm H₂O
- Release Level: 5-10 cm H₂O
- Release Frequency: 10-12 releases per minute

**Different Terminologies:**

- North America: APRV
- Europe: Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP)
- Other Names: BILEVEL, DUOPAP

In APRV, the ventilator delivers two levels of positive airway pressure over set periods, with a severe inverse inspiratory (I) time ratio, allowing spontaneous breaths at both pressure levels.

![](Pasted%20image%2020240707105325.png)

### High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation

HFOV involves very high-frequency oscillations with a low tidal volume. It utilizes an oscillating diaphragm to generate rapid pressure swings, promoting CO₂ elimination.

- **Frequency:** 4-6 Hz (240-300 breaths per minute)
- **Mean Airway Pressure:** Relatively high to maintain lung recruitment

**Gas Transport Mechanisms:**

- Convective and diffusive processes
- Asynchronous alveolar filling (pendelluft)
- Collateral ventilation between alveoli
- Cardiogenic mixing

![](Pasted%20image%2020240707105717.png)

### Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV-PC)

SIMV-PC allows synchronized mechanical breaths with the patient’s spontaneous breathing efforts. It ensures mandatory breaths if the patient’s spontaneous rate is inadequate. Features include:

- Adjustable trigger window
- Inspiratory flow sensing
- Pressure Support (PS) for spontaneous breaths
![](Pasted%20image%2020240707105438.png)
### SIMV-PCV-VG

This mode starts with a volume test breath to assess lung compliance. Subsequent breaths are pressure-controlled and adjusted to achieve the set tidal volume based on compliance. Patients can breathe spontaneously within the trigger window, with pressure-supported breaths.

### PSVPro

PSV is patient-triggered and flow-cycled, providing inspiratory support pressure (PS) once a breath is initiated by the patient. Each PSV breath is terminated based on a pre-set flow reduction. It is suitable for use with Laryngeal Mask Airways (LMAs), allowing pressure support levels below the LMA leak seal pressure.

![](Pasted%20image%2020240707105509.png)

### CPAP

CPAP maintains increased airway pressure throughout the entire breathing cycle, preventing alveolar collapse and atelectasis. During a pressure-supported breath, additional pressure is provided on top of the CPAP level during inspiration. If the patient becomes apnoeic, a backup rate and inspiratory pressure are automatically initiated until spontaneous breathing resumes.

![](Pasted%20image%2020240707105533.png)

### Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA)

- Ventilator support is linked to the neurological component of the patient’s respiratory effort.
- Assessed by transoesophageal electromyography measuring the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi).
- Amplitude of ventilator assist determined by instantaneous EAdi and the NAVA level set by the clinician.
- Improves patient-ventilator interaction, reducing the risk of over-assistance and asynchronies.

### Liquid Lung Ventilation
- **Technique**: Lungs insufflated with an oxygenated perfluorochemical liquid (PFC).
- **Advantages**:
	- Reduces surface tension by maintaining a fluid interface with alveoli.
	- Opens collapsed alveoli with lower barotrauma risk.
	- Acts as a reservoir for oxygen and CO₂ exchange with pulmonary capillary blood.
	- Functions as an efficient heat exchanger.
	- Mobilizes alveolar and airway debris and exudates.
- **Types**:
	1. Total liquid ventilation: Entire lung filled with PFC.
	2. Partial liquid ventilation: PFC delivered to lung while administering conventional gas ventilation.
- **Limitations**: Efficacy studies are disappointing; optimal clinical use is undefined.
### Negative Pressure Ventilation
- Work by intermittently applying sub-atmospheric pressure to the chest wall and abdomen, increasing transpulmonary pressure and inflating the lungs.
- Suitable for patients with stable or slowly progressive neuromuscular diseases, central hypoventilation, or chest wall deformities.
- Studies suggest benefits for patients with acute respiratory failure and COPD, but are not controlled or prospective.
## Classification of Ventilator Modes

Ventilator modes can be classified based on:

1. Mode of triggering
2. Inspiratory characteristics
3. Mode of cycling
4. Pattern of mandatory and spontaneous breaths
5. Method of synchronization

**Note:** Expiration is passive in all modes except high-frequency oscillation.
## Ventilator Desynchrony

### Definition
- **Synchrony:** Agreement between the patient’s neural inspiratory and expiratory time and the ventilator’s mechanical inspiratory and expiratory time. It includes matching patient effort with the delivered tidal volume.
- **Patient-ventilator asynchrony:** The phenomenon where the patient’s respiratory efforts and the support provided by the ventilator are not synchronized.

### Types of Asynchrony
1. **Trigger Asynchrony:** Inability to sequentially trigger a ventilator-delivered breath.
   - **Delayed Triggering:** A time delay (>100 ms) between patient development of negative airway pressure and ventilator response.
   - **Missed Triggering:** The patient's inspiratory effort fails to trigger a mechanical breath. This is the most common form of trigger asynchrony.
   - **Double Triggering:** A second mechanical breath is delivered before the patient has normally exhaled, potentially leading to increased tidal volume, transpulmonary pressure, and driving pressure, which may induce lung injury. Factors include inadequate mechanical inspiratory flow, short mechanical inspiratory time, and decreased compliance.
   - **Reverse Triggering:** A form of double triggering where a controlled mechanical breath initiates a spontaneous inspiratory effort, leading to large tidal volumes.
   
2. **Flow Asynchrony:** The gas flow provided by the ventilator does not match the inspiratory demand of the patient.
3. **Cycle Asynchrony:** The termination of the patient’s inspiratory time and the ventilator’s inspiratory time are not synchronized.
4. **Mode Asynchrony:** The selected mode of ventilation is not well-tolerated by the patient.

### BIPAP/SIMV
- **P-SIMV and BIPAP** are identical in a passive patient.
- In an active patient, patient-ventilator interaction during expiration is the same:
  - There are two expiratory time windows.
	- During the first, the patient can breathe spontaneously or with support (PSV).
	- During the second (synchronization) window, patient effort triggers a time-cycled mandatory breath.
  - The mandatory breath due is delivered early to coincide with patient inspiratory effort.
  
- The modes differ markedly during inspiration:
  - **BIPAP:** The patient can breathe throughout inspiration, with a floating valve preventing excessive airway pressure. Patient efforts are superimposed on the time-cycled inspiratory pressure, and cycling to expiration is synchronized with patient expiration.
  - **P-SIMV:** Patient effort is unrecognized during inspiration and may result in breath termination due to breaching the high-pressure safety limit.

### Minor Adjustments to Minimize Desynchrony
- **VCV:** Flow asynchrony can be lessened by using a higher peak inspiratory flow rate and a shorter inspiratory time or a decelerating flow waveform.
- **PCV:** Asynchrony can be reduced by adjusting inspiratory time, flow acceleration, and driving pressure.
- **PSV:** Adjustments in expiratory termination criteria or inspiratory time can improve asynchrony.
# HFN02 (High-Flow Nasal Oxygen)

## Overview

High-flow nasal oxygen (HFN02) therapy provides high inspiratory flow rates, significantly enhancing delivered FiO2 compared to other oxygen therapy methods. It is especially effective even during high respiratory effort, offering several physiological and practical benefits.

### Key Features

- **High Inspiratory Flow Rates:** Up to 70 liters/minute, resulting in higher FiO2 (e.g., FiO2 of 0.9 vs. 0.7 for standard trauma mask therapy).
- **PEEP Provision:** Unpredictable but estimated at 1 cm H2O of PEEP for each 10 liters of inspiratory flow.
- **Patient Comfort:** More easily tolerated than non-invasive ventilation (NIV), allowing patients to eat, drink, and use for prolonged periods without facial skin disruption.
- **Dead Space Reduction:** Washout of the upper airway reduces dead space, aiding in hypercapnic respiratory failure without necessarily combining high flow with high FiO2.
- **Warm and Humidified Gases:** Provided at flows up to 60 liters/min, with inspired oxygen concentrations up to 100%.

## Equipment

### Components

- **Nasal Cannulae:** Standard sized or wide-bore prongs.
- **Oxygen Flow Meter:** Connected to an air–oxygen gas blender and gas analyzer.
- **Heating System and Humidifier:** Deliver gases at temperatures between 33 and 43°C and 95–100% humidity.

### Comparison of HFNOT Devices

|Device Tradename|Flow Rate (liters/min)|Relative Humidity (%)|Gas Temperature (°C)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Standard nasal cannula|1-4|Not humidified|Not warmed|
|Salter adult high flow cannula 1600HF™|15|Not humidified|Not warmed|
|Vapotherm precision 2000i high flow therapy™|5-40|95-100|33-43|
|Fisher and Paykel optiflow high flow nasal cannula™|1-60|100|37|

## Physiological Basis for the Use of HFNOT

|Feature of HFNOT|Physiological Effect|
|---|---|
|Warmed humidified gas|Reduced airway surface dehydration|
||Improved secretion clearance|
||Decreased atelectasis|
|Gas flow up to 60 liters/min|CO₂ washout, reduction in anatomical dead space|
||Provides an oxygen reservoir|
||Allows FiO₂ close to 1.0 to be delivered|
|PEEP|Increased end-expiratory lung volume|
||Alveolar recruitment|

## Humidification

- Initiate HFNOT at lower flows, gradually increasing temperature for improved patient compliance. Starting at 25 liters/min and 31°C for the first 15 minutes is recommended, then titrate gas temperature to 34-37°C within the initial 30 minutes.

## Dead Space and PEEP

- HFNOT creates an anatomical oxygen reservoir in the nasopharynx and oropharynx through CO2 washout, reducing dead space and work of breathing. The CPAP effect provides an upper airway distending pressure of 3.2–7.4 cm H2O with the mouth closed.

## Indications

### Acute Hypoxaemic Respiratory Failure (ARF)

- HFNOT provides FIO2 close to 1.0, PEEP of ∼5 cm H2O, and humidified gases through a comfortable interface. The FLORALI trial demonstrated that HFNOT can reduce intubation requirements in non-cardiogenic ARF with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio <200 mm Hg. No difference in intubation rates for higher PaO2/FIO2 ratios. Significantly reduced mortality rates during ICU admission and within 90 days for HFNOT patients.

### Airway Management

- Useful in both emergency and elective airway management for preoxygenation, providing an oxygen reservoir during apnea. Particularly beneficial in anticipated difficult airways and in patients with reduced functional residual capacity or increased metabolic demand for oxygen. Successfully used in awake fiberoptic intubation, offering near 1.0 FIO2 via soft nasal cannulae.

### Extubation

- Postoperative hypoxemia is common after major abdominal surgery due to lung derecruitment and altered respiratory mechanics. HFNOT may reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, as investigated in the OPERA trial, potentially expanding HFNOT use in ward-based settings.
# Paralysis
## Overview

Recent research has indicated that the early use of the benzoquinolonium neuromuscular blocker cisatracurium over a 48-hour period can lead to significant clinical benefits in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), particularly those with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <120 mmHg.

### Key Findings

- **Improved 90-Day Survival:** Early administration of cisatracurium was associated with improved 90-day survival rates in a population adjusted for the severity of hypoxaemia.
- **Increased Ventilator-Free Time:** Patients demonstrated increased ventilator-free days.
- **Reduced Risk of Barotrauma:** There was a decreased incidence of barotrauma.
- **No Significant Increase in Muscle Weakness:** Surprisingly, there was no significant increase in muscle weakness in the study population.

### Implications

These findings have influenced a shift in ventilator strategies for severe ARDS, moving away from the maintenance of spontaneous breathing during the early stages.

### Mechanisms of Benefit

The potential mechanisms by which neuromuscular blockade may improve survival include:

- **Reduction in Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI):** Improved control of inspiratory and expiratory pressures and volumes.
- **Decreased Patient-Ventilator Asynchrony:** Leading to more effective and safer ventilation.

### Clinical Recommendations

- **Severe ARDS:** It is currently reasonable to consider the addition of neuromuscular blockade for patients with severe ARDS.
- **Patient-Ventilator Asynchrony:** Neuromuscular blockade may be particularly beneficial for those experiencing any degree of asynchrony.
- **Prone Positioning:** Patients in the prone position may also benefit from neuromuscular blockade to enhance ventilatory control.

# Different Ventilation Scenarios

[[ARDS]]

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311155931.png)

## Asthma/Bronchospasm

### How to Detect Air Trapping on Ventilator

- Exhalation flow does not return to baseline (Patient is still exhaling when the next breath starts).

### How to Determine AutoPEEP (Total PEEP - Extrinsic PEEP)

- Perform expiratory hold.

### Principles of Ventilating Airflow Obstructed Patients

- Prevent AutoPEEP.
- Prolong expiratory time: Decrease RR, decrease inspiratory time, increase inspiratory flow, increase I:E ratio.
- Decrease tidal volume.
- Ensure flow returns to baseline.
- Avoid dyssynchrony.
- Match AutoPEEP with applied PEEP (PEEP is required to prevent airway collapse).
- Permissive hypercapnia.

### Initial Vent Settings

- RR: 10-12 breaths/min.
- I: Eratio: 1:3-4.
- Inspiratory flow: >60 L/min.
- Tidal Volume (TV): 6-8 ml/kg.
- PEEP: Match intrinsic PEEP.
- FiO2: Target >88%.
- pH: Maintain >7.2.

## COPD

### General

- Low tidal volume strategies intraoperatively lead to higher pulmonary compliance, lower airway resistance, better PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and higher PaCO2 levels.
- COPD patients undergoing elective surgery should be in a stable condition with optimal medical treatment; surgery should be postponed during acute exacerbations.
- Stable COPD patients have a 4-fold increased risk of PPC.
- Patients with FEV1 >60% are typically at low risk of PPC.
- Unadjusted PPC incidence is 18.2% in COPD patients undergoing surgery; risk increases with COPD severity.
- History and physical examination are poor predictors of airway obstruction; spirometry is useful for symptomatic patients.

### Pathophysiology

1. COPD involves chronic inflammation of small airways and lung parenchyma, leading to obstructive bronchiolitis, parenchymal destruction, and emphysema.
2. Increased airway resistance and decreased elastic recoil cause incomplete expiration, higher residual end-expiratory volume, hyperinflation, and autoPEEP.
3. Chronic inflammation and parenchymal destruction impair gas exchange, causing hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

#### Physiology Influencing Ventilation

- Expiratory flow limitation in COPD is compensated by increasing inspiratory flow and lung volume, leading to inspiratory muscle fatigue and acute respiratory failure due to dynamic hyperinflation (DH).

### Non-Invasive Positive-Pressure Ventilation (NPPV)

- NPPV reduces endotracheal intubation and its complications by offsetting intrinsic PEEP and augmenting tidal volume.
- **Major criteria for NPPV:** Respiratory arrest, loss of consciousness, psychomotor agitation, hemodynamic instability, heart rate <50 bpm with loss of alertness, gasping for air.
- **Minor criteria:** Respiratory rate >35 breaths/min, worsening acidemia or pH <7.25, PaO2 <40 mm Hg or PaO2/FiO2 <200 mm Hg, decreasing level of consciousness.

### Ventilation Strategy

- Use assist-control or synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with high inspiratory flow rates to reduce I:Eratio.
- Use pressure-support ventilation or synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with a low rate if the patient has respiratory drive to prevent worsening DH and autoPEEP.
- Titrate minute ventilation to pH rather than PaCO2 to prevent acute alkalemia and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
- Use low tidal volumes to limit peak alveolar pressure to <30 cm H2O.

#### Use of Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)

- Apply external PEEP below 75-85% of intrinsic PEEP to avoid worsening hyperinflation or circulatory compromise.
- Dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation can be assessed using esophageal balloon or changes in inspiratory capacity.

##### Quantifying AutoPEEP

- Use expiratory hold, esophageal balloon, CVP changes, ventilator graphic waveform, or clinical observation to detect autoPEEP.
- Signs of DH include slow filling of manual ventilator bag, capnography trace not reaching plateau, expiratory flow not reaching zero, and measuring intrinsic PEEP.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240707111939.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020240707112001.png)

#### Management of AutoPEEP

- Allow more time for exhalation by reducing RR or I:#ratio to 1:3-1:5, or use higher inspiratory flow rates with high peak pressures.
- Apply PEEP to keep small airways open during late exhalation, aiming for external PEEP below intrinsic PEEP to avoid significant increases in alveolar pressure and cardiovascular compromise.

### Strategies to Improve Pulmonary Gas Exchange

- Address shunt, ventilation-perfusion abnormalities, and diffusion defects. Manage hypoxemia based on the underlying cause.

### Strategies to Reduce Work of Breathing

- Decrease respiratory workload, increase muscle strength, and provide mechanical ventilatory support if needed.

##### Factors Affecting Work of Breathing

### Heliox

- Heliox decreases airway resistance and work of breathing, especially in upper airway obstruction.
- Improves aerosolized bronchodilator deposition and reduces dynamic hyperinflation (DH) by 15%.

### Corticosteroids

- Short courses of systemic corticosteroids benefit COPD patients during exacerbations by increasing FEV1, reducing hospital stay, and decreasing withdrawals.
# Weaning from the Ventilator

## Extubation Feasibility Review (ROMSHA Points)

- **Reason:**
	- Original reason for intubation and ventilation resolved?
	- Most relevant for patients intubated for relief of work of breathing due to metabolic acidosis.
- **Oxygenation Adequate:**
	- Oxygenation Index <5 (preferably <4.5) unless strong history of chronic lung disease and a decision is made that further improvement is unlikely.
- **Mechanics Adequate:** All of the following:
	- Respiratory rate ≥ 10
	- Respiratory rate ≤ 25
	- Tidal volume ≥ 6 ml/kg (preferably much larger) on (IPAP - PEEP) ≤ 6 cmH₂O
	- Regular breathing
	- No evident use of accessory muscles, no nasal flaring
	- If in doubt, T-piece test of no more than 30 minutes
- **Secretions Manageable by Patient Without Assistance?**
	- Minimal secretions
	- Moderate thin secretions in patient with good cough
	- Ask senior nursing staff for opinion on patient's ability to cope.
- **Heart Failure Unlikely?**
	- Positive pressure ventilation aids failing left ventricle; withdrawal can lead to acute left heart failure with pulmonary oedema and hence extubation failure
	- If in doubt, T-piece test of no more than 30 minutes
- **Airway Capable of Being Maintained by Patient?**
	- Alert, follows commands
	- No anatomical airway abnormality splinted by endotracheal tube.

**Post-extubation:** Nebulized adrenaline (1 mg of 1:1000) plus 2 ml normal saline may be given if airway oedema is a concern, but has no proven benefit.

## 2 Phases
- **Readiness Testing**
- **Liberation**

### Readiness Testing (ROMS2HAM)
- **Reversed:** Condition for which patient was intubated is reversed
- **Oxygenation Adequate:** Oxygenation Index <5, PaO2/FiO2 ratio >300 mmHg; FiO2 <50%
- **Mechanics of Breathing Adequate:** RSBI (RR/TV in liters) <105, VC >15 ml/kg, RR <30
- **Secretions and Stable:** Secretions controlled, minimal inotropes
- **Heart Failure:** Left heart failure present (HFPEF)
- **Airway:** Able to maintain airway, cuff leak test required, obeys commands, able to cough
- **Medications:** Any medications suppressing respiratory drive

### Liberation
- Stop feeds for at least 4 hours
- Perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)

#### What is a Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT)?

The SBT assesses the patient’s ability to breathe spontaneously for a sustained period. It evaluates the balance between respiratory muscle strength and the work of breathing imposed by both elastic and airflow resistance, considering chest wall compliance, lung compliance, and pulmonary mechanics.

#### How to Perform a SBT
- Oxygen delivered at a concentration of no more than 40%
- Pressure support ventilation (CPAP/PSV mode)
- PEEP of 5 cmH2O
- Pressure support set at 8 cmH2O
- Pressure support expiratory flow cycle set to less than 10% (set in advanced settings)
- The SBT should continue for a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of 2 hours.
- Perform an ABG after the SBT; if acceptable and other extubation criteria are met, proceed with extubation.

#### When to Stop a SBT

If the patient develops any of the following, they are deemed to have failed the SBT and should be recommenced on full ventilation:

- Tachypnea (>30 breaths per minute)
- Apnea or bradypnea
- PaO2 <60 mm Hg (8 kPa)
- PaCO2 >7.3 kPa
- RSBI >105

#### Equipment Required to Safely Extubate
- Monitoring with an ECG and pulse oximeter
- AMBU-bag/self-inflating resuscitation bag with valve and mask, connected to an oxygen source
- High vacuum suction equipment, suction tubing, Yankauer suction device, and sterile suction catheters
- Resuscitation trolley with laryngoscope, stylette/bougie, and a selection of differently sized endotracheal tubes
- Non-sterile gloves
- Scissors
- Source of humidified oxygen, an entrainment oxygen mask (capable of delivering 40% oxygen), and tubing
- Syringe for deflation of the cuff of the endotracheal tube
- Drugs for reintubation (e.g., propofol or etomidate AND suxamethonium, cisatracurium, or rocuronium)

### How to Extubate
1. Sit the patient in a semi-Fowler's position (head of the bed elevated to 45-60°).
2. Pre-oxygenate the patient for 3 minutes with 100% oxygen.
3. Suction the patient’s mouth, oropharynx, nasogastric, and endotracheal tube prior to extubation.
4. Cut the tape holding the endotracheal tube.
5. Deflate the cuff slowly.
6. Remove the tube at the end of a positive pressure breath (if an AMBU bag is applied) or, if the patient is on CPAP, ask them to take a deep breath; extubation is performed at the end of inspiration to maximize cough effectiveness.
7. Apply 40% humidified oxygen by face mask.
8. Monitor the patient continuously for 10 minutes by competent medical personnel and evaluate every 30 minutes for 4 hours following extubation. Assess:
	- Respiratory rate
	- Heart rate
	- Blood pressure
	- Color
	- Evidence of use of accessory muscles
	- Presence of diaphoresis (sweating)
	- Evidence of agitation/distress
	- Oxygen saturation must be measured continuously with a pulse oximeter for at least 30 minutes following extubation.
9. Perform an arterial blood gas 30 minutes after extubation.

### The “Cuff Leak Test”
1. Suction the mouth and pharynx.
2. Disconnect the patient from the ventilator and allow spontaneous ventilation through the endotracheal tube.
3. Deflate the cuff of the endotracheal tube and occlude the end with your thumb (wear sterile gloves).
4. Presence of a leak around the tube may indicate resolution of swelling.
5. Patients at high risk of post-extubation stridor are identified with a low level of leak.
6. Passing if >110 ml or audible leak or if 25% of TV lost.

### Failure to Wean Differential
- Primary process not resolved: Sepsis, GCS, etc.
- Neurological: Resp drive blunted due to narcotics, midazolam, CO2 narcosis.
- Muscle weakness: Diaphragm atrophy, nutrition, electrolytes, critical illness myopathy, NMB, hypothyroidism.
- Poor compliance: Pulmonary edema, ARDS, pleural effusion, abdominal compartment syndrome, autoPEEP, demand, fever, metabolic acidosis.
- Increased demand: Fever, hyperthermia, etc.
