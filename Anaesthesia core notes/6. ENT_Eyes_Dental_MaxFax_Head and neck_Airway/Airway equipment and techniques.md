# Equipment for Airway Management

## Introduction

- Safe, effective, and reliable equipment is essential for:
  - Provision of gas exchange (oxygen delivery to and carbon dioxide removal from the lungs).
  - Protection of the lungs from aspiration injury.
- Equipment is used as part of an ‘airway management strategy,’ a coordinated, logical sequence of plans emphasized by the 4th National Audit Project (NAP4) on emergency airway management.
- Airway plans form the core of the Difficult Airway Society (DAS) guidelines for managing unanticipated difficult tracheal intubation.
- Functional compatibility is crucial (e.g., a tracheal introducer or stylet must fit the chosen tracheal tube).
- All equipment must have standard dimensions when matching is needed (e.g., standard 15/22 mm connectors for connection to breathing systems).
- All equipment must be biologically compatible and supplied sterile.
- Capnography should be used in all situations where airway equipment is in use.
- Occasionally, airway equipment is used alongside other devices for a safer outcome:
  - Use of nasal cannulae to deliver oxygen to an apnoeic patient to extend safe apnoea time during airway management.
  - Recent application: nasal high-flow oxygen from a humidifier (THRIVE) to extend apnoea time.
- DAS has introduced the ‘ADEPT’ scheme for device evaluation, recommending device consideration for purchase following evaluation of evidence at ‘level 3’, a case series.

### The Five Approaches to Airway Management

1. Facemask ventilation (FMV) using adjuncts.
2. Airway clearance.
3. Supraglottic airway device use.
4. Tracheal access above the vocal cords.
5. Tracheal access below the vocal cords (tracheostomy or cricothyroidotomy).

- These approaches may be used alone or in sequence. There is sometimes overlap (e.g., a supraglottic airway can be used for intubation).

### Facemask Ventilation (FMV) Using Adjuncts

- FMV involves close and continual contact with the patient. A facemask consists of a mount (connected to a breathing system via an angle piece), body, and edge (preformed or inflatable cuff).
- Optimal positioning of the patient’s head and neck and maintaining a mask seal is necessary.
- Adjuncts:
  - Oropharyngeal (Guedel) airways.
  - Nasopharyngeal airways.
- **Han Grading of FMV**:
  - 0: Not attempted
  - 1: Ventilated by mask
  - 2: Ventilated, adjuncts needed
  - 3: Ventilated, difficult (two-handed, adjuncts needed)
  - 4: Impossible

### Airway Clearance

- Blood, secretions, or debris are cleared with suction apparatus.
- Oropharyngeal suction is performed with a Yankauer sucker, which can have a side port to digitally control flow.
- Softer tracheal catheters are used for tracheal and nasopharyngeal suction.
- Debris and foreign bodies can be removed with forceps, using a laryngoscope for illumination.
- Care must be taken to prevent pushing debris further inwards.

### Supraglottic Airway Devices

- Supraglottic airway devices (SADs) serve as a middle ground between FMV and intubation concerning anatomy, security, and invasiveness.
- All are inserted blindly, with over 15 devices available, both single-use and reusable. It is currently uncertain which is clinically superior.
- **Classification**:
  - **First-generation devices**: Provide an airway with a low-pressure (<20 cm H₂O) seal.
  - **Second-generation devices**: Modified to provide a greater seal pressure, drainage of gastric content, and reduce dental damage.
- **LMA Classic (cLMA)**:
  - Unrivalled clinical use in over 500 million patients.
  - Made of silicone, consists of an airway tube with connector, an inflatable cuff (mask), and a tube for cuff inflation.
  - The bowl of the mask has a grille to prevent intrusion of tongue or epiglottis.
  - The cuff extends inferiorly to the upper oesophagus, bilaterally to the pyriform fossae, and superiorly to the tongue base, forming a seal by inflation to <60 cm H₂O.
  - Available in 8 sizes based on patient weight (sizes 1-6 with 1.5 and 2.5) and may be reused 40 times.
  - Limitations include aspiration risk, low compliance chest, and periglottic pathology.
  - Applications: elective anaesthesia, rescue airway device, intubating conduit, tracheal tube exchange (Bailey manoeuvre).
- **Flexible LMA (FLMA)**:
  - Reusable device similar to the cLMA available in sizes 2-5.
  - The airway tube is narrower, longer, and wound with spiral wire.
  - Useful for head, neck, and dental surgery due to its flexibility.
  - Limitations are the same as for the cLMA.
- **ProSeal LMA (PLMA)**:
  - Second-generation device with modifications for higher seal pressures and gastric drainage.
  - Made of silicone and reusable (40 times).
  - Indications for use similar to the cLMA.
  - Techniques for insertion include using the index finger, spatula, or introducer.
- **Single-use SADs**:
  - Avoid technical and logistical issues of decontamination and sterilization.
  - Driven by concerns over transmissible prion disease.
  - Both first- (e.g., LMA Unique) and second-generation (e.g., LMA Supreme, I-gel) devices are available.
- **Intubating LMA (ILMA)**:
  - A SAD and conduit for tracheal tube passage.
  - Sizes 3-5 are available, reusable (40 times) or single-use.
  - The design includes an airway tube, bowl with a moulded tube guide, and epiglottic elevator bar.
  - The ILMA is designed for use with a dedicated tracheal tube, either reusable (silicone) or single-use (Fastrach).
  - ILMA insertion is blind, useful for patients at risk of cervical cord damage.
  - To remove the ILMA, a stabilizing rod is used to offset frictional forces while pulling out the ILMA over the tube.

### Tracheal Access Above the Vocal Cords

- Tracheal access above the glottis involves passing a tracheal tube through the vocal cords using a visual technique, with a laryngoscope to view the larynx.
- Intubation below the glottis includes tracheostomy or cricothyroidotomy.

#### Laryngoscopes

- Laryngoscopes allow visually guided tracheal intubation by viewing the laryngeal inlet.
- Three criteria for successful intubation:
  - View of the larynx.
  - Alignment of the airway axes.
  - Space for tube passage.
- Limitations of all laryngoscopes:
  - Blood or secretions degrade or obscure the view.
  - Trismus: The mouth must open sufficiently to accept the device blade and tracheal tube.
  - Training: Effective use requires sufficient practice.

#### Main Types of Laryngoscopes

1. **Rigid Direct Bladed Laryngoscopes**:
   - Standard: Straight (Miller), Curved (Macintosh).
   - Modified: McCoy.
   
2. **Rigid Indirect Bladed Laryngoscopes**:
   - Using a prism (Belscope), mirror (McMorrow), fibreoptics (Bullard), or video camera (MacGrath).
   
3. **Intubating Conduits**:
   - Optical (Airtraq) or video camera (CTrach).

4. **Optical Stylets**:
   - Rigid (Bonfils), malleable (Shikani).

5. **Flexible Fibreoptic Devices**:
   - Fibreoptic laryngoscopes for ENT practice; longer flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope (FFOB) for intubation and laryngoscopy.

#### Rigid Direct Bladed Laryngoscopes

- Consist of a handle containing batteries joined to a blade, either straight or curved.
- Illumination is provided by a light source in the blade or a fibreoptic bundle transmitting light from the handle.
- Blade features include spatula, flange, and beak of varying geometry. Some have modifications, such as a movable tip (McCoy).
- **Success Factors**:
  - Patient Factors:
	- Mouth opening.
	- Dentition.
	- Neck mobility.
	- Airway swellings.
	- Contamination with blood, secretions, or debris.
  - Practitioner Factors:
	- Correct device choice.
	- Technique.

##### Standard Blades

- Designed to lift the epiglottis, either straight or curved.
- **Miller Blade** (Standard Straight Blade):
  - Achieves a line of sight (LoS) by passing the beak posterior to the epiglottis, lifting it directly to expose the larynx.
  
- **Macintosh Blade** (Standard Curved Blade):
  - Beak placed in the vallecula, applying antero-inferior traction to the tongue base, tensioning the hyo-epiglottic ligament, and lifting the epiglottis indirectly to expose the larynx.
  - The Cormack and Lehane grading for the laryngeal view is based on Macintosh blade use.
- Limitations:
  - Prominent upper teeth interfering with LoS and risking dental damage.
  - Tongue base pathology preventing the beak from entering the vallecula.
  - Anterior larynx: small mandibular space causing tongue protrusion, obscuring the view.
  - Floppy epiglottis, especially in infants, limits curved blade use.

##### Modified Blades for Rigid Direct Laryngoscopy

- **Polio Blade**:
  - Curved blade forming an obtuse (120°) angle with the handle.
  - Originally used for patients in ‘iron lung’ ventilators; now used for patients with small ‘sternal space’ (e.g., large breasts).
  
- **Reversed Blade**:
  - Curved blade, a ‘mirror image’ version of the Macintosh, designed to displace the tongue rightwards.
  - Useful for patients in the right lateral position or with right-sided pyriform fossa masses.
  
- **McCoy Blade**:
  - A Macintosh variant with a lever-operated movable blade tip to enhance epiglottic displacement.
  - Useful when neck movement is limited by injury.
  
- **Flexiblade**:
  - Another curved blade with a lever flexing the distal half of the blade.
  
- **Other Direct Laryngoscopes**:
  - Many eponymous blades available, usually variations on straight or curved blades. They have not shown convincing improvements over standard blades in general use.
  
- **Single-Use Blades**:
  - Introduced to reduce cross-infection. Plastic curved blades were prone to failure in use. Metal blades are available.

#### CTrach

- An ILMA development with a detachable camera and screen, allowing visualization of the larynx.
- Technically a form of laryngoscope, but currently not available.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240408160348.png)
### Rigid Indirect Bladed Laryngoscopes

- These devices achieve a view using:
  - Reflection (using a prism, mirror, or fibreoptics).
  - Electronic (video) imaging (videolaryngoscopes).

#### Reflection with Prism

- **Belscope**:
  - Curved blade with a Perspex prism in the blade achieving an indirect line of sight (LoS).

#### Reflection with Mirror

- **McMorrow Blade**:
  - Curved, hinged blade with a dental mirror, actuated by levers, giving an upside-down view.

#### Reflection with Fibreoptics

- Introduced in the 1990s, these devices have a rigid, usually curved blade with fibreoptic illumination and image transmission.
- Examples include Bullard and Upsher scopes.
- Not in common use.

#### Electronic (Video) Imaging

- Videolaryngoscopes are increasingly common in clinical practice.
- A digital camera is housed near the beak of a blade with image transmission to a screen.
- Examples include Glidescope, McGrath Series 5, McGrath MAC, CMAC, and AP Advance.
- These devices provide a laryngeal view and can ‘see around the corner’.
- Reduced airway alignment and space for tube passage compared to direct laryngoscopy.
- The blade is usually protected by a single-use sheath.

#### Classification of Videolaryngoscopes

1. **Obligate Videolaryngoscopy**:
   - No direct view achievable; the user must view the screen (e.g., Glidescope, McGrath Series 5).
   - A stylet to curve the tube into a ‘hockey stick’ configuration is needed.
   - Care must be taken to avoid palatal injury due to the ‘blind spot’ during insertion.

2. **Optional Videolaryngoscopy**:
   - Less acute; the user may choose to view the larynx either directly or indirectly (e.g., McGrath MAC with MAC blade).
   - Allows transition from direct to indirect techniques.
   - Useful for teaching airway anatomy.

3. **Orienting Videolaryngoscopy**:
   - Guiding channel for the tracheal tube in the airway blade (e.g., Pentax Airway Scope).
   - By selecting a blade sheath with a channel, videoscopes from the other two groups can join this set (e.g., McGrath MAC with X blade).
- Currently, no strong data recommend which device is generally superior.

### Intubating Conduits

#### Optical Imaging

- **Airtraq**:
  - Single-use device using illuminated lenses and prisms to display the larynx with an intubating channel.

#### Electronic Imaging

- **CTrach**:
  - Modified ILMA with illumination and camera within the bowl.
  - Image transmitted to a detachable screen.
  - Allows simultaneous visualization, ventilation, and intubation.
  - Currently unavailable.

### Optical Stylets

1. **Rigid Stylet**:
   - **Bonfils**:
	 - Fibreoptic illumination and imaging within a 5 mm straight (but distally curved) stylet, over which a tracheal tube is loaded.
	 - Allows intubation with minimal neck movement.

2. **Malleable Stylet**:
   - **Shikani**:
	 - Similar to Bonfils but with a malleable tip.
	 - The malleable tip risks damage to the fibreoptic components.

### Intubation with a Flexible Fibreoptic Bronchoscope (FFOB)

- Used for airway inspection, biopsy, toilet, and tracheal intubation by oral or nasal routes, under local or general anaesthesia.
- **Components**:
  - **Insertion Cord**:
	- Fibreoptic light and viewing bundles.
	- Tip control elements.
	- Working (suction) channels.
  - **Control Body**:
	- Handle, control lever, eyepiece.
	- Light-guide from battery or umbilical (cable).
- FFOB is expensive, delicate, and requires intense decontamination.
- Training is needed to master patient preparation and device use.
- **Limitations**:
  - Image loss with blood or secretions.
  - Inability of some patients to tolerate an awake approach.
  - Deficits in practitioner skill.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240408160500.png)
### Light-Guided Intubation

- Intubation using transillumination is successful with training.
  - Devices such as the Trachlight, loaded with a tube, are inserted blindly into the airway.
  - The quality of light transmitted through the neck indicates tube placement.
  - Useful with blood in the airway.

### Supraglottic Airway Device (SAD) Guided Intubation

- Previously described (ILMA).

### Tracheal Tubes

- The tube provides airway patency and protection.
- Most single-use tubes are polyvinyl chloride and reusable tubes are silicone.

#### Standard Tracheal Tube Components

- **Connector**: 15 mm external diameter.
- **Tube**:
  - Marked with radio-opaque line, cm distance markers from the tip, depth marker 3 cm from the tip.
  - Information on internal (ID) and external diameters.
- **Tip**:
  - Left-facing beveled opening.
  - Some have an additional opening, a Murphy eye, to allow ventilation if the main opening is blocked.

#### Cuffed and Uncuffed Tubes

- The cuff is inflated with air via a pilot tube, balloon, and self-sealing valve.
- Cuff pressure should be <30 cm water, measured with a manometer.
- Nitrous oxide increases pressure by diffusion.

#### Specialized Tracheal Tubes

- **Reinforced Tubes**: Have spiral wire to resist kinking, used for neurosurgery and maxillofacial surgery.
- **ILMA Tubes**: Described above.
- **Preformed Tubes**: Molded to direct the tube away from the operative site for ENT surgery (e.g., Polar and RAE tubes).
- **Microlaryngeal Tubes**: 5 mm ID, soft-walled, cuffed tube used for laryngeal procedures.
- **Laser Tubes**: Ignition resistant, either metal or silicone/metal wrapped, used for laser airway surgery.
  - Some have two cuffs; inflation with saline is advised.
- **Thoracic Surgery Tubes**:
  - Double-lumen tubes: One lumen enters one mainstem bronchus, the other lies in the trachea (e.g., Robertshaw tube).
  - Single lumen Bronchial blocking tubes: Balloon-tipped guidewires designed as endobronchial blockers (e.g., Univent, Arndt, Cohen tubes).
- **Subglottic Tubes**: Narrow catheters for laryngeal surgery (e.g., Hunsaker, Jet Catheter).
  - Require high-pressure source ventilation (HPSV).
  - Second lumen may measure respiratory pressures or gas composition.
- **Tracheostomy Tubes**: Short and curved.
  - Some have an inner cannula for cleaning.
  - Others have an adjustable flange to alter the depth of insertion into the neck.

### Aids to Tracheal Intubation

- **Stylet**: A malleable, coated wire rod inserted into a tracheal tube to bend it.
  - When a tight distal curve is formed, it is called a ‘hockey stick’.
  - The stylet should not protrude beyond the tube orifice.
- **Tracheal Introducer**:
  - A guide for intubation when the laryngeal view is incomplete or tube passage is problematic.
  - The standard device is the Portex Venn (previously the Eschmann introducer), called a ‘bougie’.
	- A 60 cm flexible rod with an angled ‘coude’ tip made of braided polyester with resin coatings.
	- Can be reused six times.
  - Single-use devices (e.g., Frova) have higher risks of trauma.
	- Adaptors permit HPSV but barotrauma is a risk.
- **Aintree Intubating Catheter**:
  - A 56 cm long hollow tube with adaptors for breathing systems and HPSV.
  - Threaded over a 4.0 mm FFOB or through a SAD into the trachea allowing a tracheal tube (>7.0 mm ID) to be guided over it.
- **Airway Exchange Catheters**:
  - Long (83 cm) hollow catheters for tracheal tube exchange.
  - Adaptors allow for oxygen insufflation or HPSV.
  - The catheter tip must remain in the tracheal lumen; distal placement risks lung injury or barotrauma with administered oxygen.
- **Retrograde Intubation Equipment**:
  - A cannula or epidural needle accesses the trachea via the cricothyroid membrane (CTM).
  - An epidural catheter or guidewire is threaded rostrally, exiting the mouth, passed through a tracheal tube or working channel of an FFOB acting as an intubation guide.

### Airway Management Below the Glottis: Cricothyroidotomy and Tracheostomy

#### Tracheostomy

- Performed when airway patency or protection via the upper airway is not assured.
- Surgical approach is called ‘open’.
- Percutaneous dilational techniques are often done within critical care.

#### Cricothyroidotomy

- Involves airway access through the cricothyroid membrane.
- Temporary technique with conversion to another form of airway control advised, usually within a day.
- Two groups; both approaches should be learned.

1. **Narrow Bore (<4 mm ID)**:
   - Catheter-over-needle (e.g., Ravussin, Cricath).
   - High flow resistance, HPSV needed for efficient gas exchange; expiratory pathway is via the patient’s own upper airway.
   - Risks include catheter misplacement, kinking, and barotrauma.
   - Oxygenation by insufflation possible by connecting the cannula via tubing to flow-metered oxygen, but carbon dioxide is not cleared.
   - Enk Flow Modulator: A single-use device improving oxygen delivery from flow-metered oxygen.
   - Ventrain: Single-use jet ventilator driven from flow-metered oxygen using the venturi principle to extract expiratory gas from the narrow-bore cannula.
	 - Expiration is independent of the patient’s upper airway patency, potentially increasing safety in rescue from upper airway obstruction.
	 - Limited clinical data available.

2. **Wider Bore (>4 mm ID)**:
   - Lower resistance; gas exchange achievable with standard breathing systems.
   - Uncuffed Quicktrach 1 available in three diameters (1.5, 2.0, and 4.0 mm).
   - 4.0 mm ID Quicktrach 2 is cuffed.
   - Designed for direct percutaneous insertion with a cutting needle, removable guard to reduce risk of posterior laryngeal wall damage.
   - Other examples include the Portex PTK and the Melker:
	 - Available in uncuffed or 5.0 mm ID cuffed versions. The latter is part of the Melker Universal kit.
	 - May be inserted using a wire-guided and dilational technique (‘Seldinger’) or using a scalpel (‘Surgical’) incision, controlled with a tracheal hook followed by tracheal dilation with forceps to allow tube insertion.
   - Surgicric: A kit with scalpel, tracheal hook, and a 7.0 mm ID cuffed tube with a movable flange.
   - Surgical approach can be used with any suitable size tracheal tube.
   - Care must be taken to avoid excessive insertion, which could lead to endobronchial intubation.
   - Minitrach: Designed for tracheobronchial toilet, not gas exchange provision.
- Cricothyroidotomy is performed in three clinical situations:
  - **Procedural**: Allows surgical access in laryngeal surgery.
  - **Precautionary**: When airway management is predicted to be difficult, serving as an ‘insurance policy’.
  - **Perimortem**: When all forms of airway control have failed, performed as a final rescue effort in the ‘Can’t Intubate, Can’t Ventilate’ scenario (better termed ‘Can’t Intubate, Can’t Oxygenate’).
	- This is Plan D of the DAS guidelines.
	- NAP4 shows failure rates for narrow bore devices at about 70% and about 45% for wider bore devices.
	- Lack of training and performance anxiety are likely major factors.
	- Emphasizes the need for a safe and effective strategy to reduce the risk of reaching this dangerous situation.

## Flexible Intubation Scopes
- **a. Fibreoptic Scopes**
  - Sophisticated devices that allow visualisation from the scope tip, which is steerable. Ideally, a scope should be available with a video output allowing magnification and viewing of the image by all members of the anaesthesia and surgical teams rather than just the endoscopist.
  - **Suppliers:**
	- Karl Storz
	- Olympus
	- Pentax
- **b. Flexible Scope**
  - A single-use flexible scope utilising LED light and CMOS image capture without fibreoptics, the aScope is available from SSEM-Ambu with an accompanying portable monitor (aView).

## Techniques for Rigid Bronchoscopy

### Technique–Finding The Larynx and Vocal Cords (VCs)

1. **Preparation**
   - Select the largest suitable bronchoscope.
   - Positioning: Intubation/sniffing the air.
   - Introduce the scope in midline in a vertical position, with the long bevel anteriorly.

2. **Procedure**
   - Slide the scope over the thumb/dental guard.
   - Identify the uvula.
   - Advance the scope in midline and identify the epiglottis.

### Technique – Finding the Larynx and VCs (Continued)

1. **Further Steps**
   - Lift the epiglottis anteriorly with the long beveled tip of the scope.
   - Identify the posterior laryngeal inlet: arytenoids and posterior VCs.

2. **Tips**
   - Use a Hopkins rod inside the bronchoscope.
   - Elevate the epiglottis with a laryngoscope.

### Technique – Passing Between the VCs

1. **Preparation**
   - Remove the pillow and extend the patient’s head.
   - Rotate the scope through 90° keeping the longer beveled edge to the right.

2. **Procedure**
   - Advance the scope with the tip of the bevel directed between the VCs.
   - Slide the shorter edge along the left VC.
   - Rotate the scope back through 90° when into the trachea.

### Technique – Passing Between the VCs (Continued)

1. **Tips**
   - Sit down on a mobile chair.
   - Avoid traumatizing the right VC with the long bevel.
   - Long bevel can be used to “core” through a tumour.
   - Identify the carina.
   - Ventilate through the bronchoscope.
   - Pass a bougie through the scope, remove the scope and pass ET tube over the bougie.
# Regional Anaesthesia for the Airway

## Main Nerves to Be Blocked

1. Trigeminal Nerve
2. Glossopharyngeal Nerve
3. Vagus Nerve Branches
   - Superior Laryngeal Nerve
   - Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve

### Trigeminal Nerve Block

- **Branches to be blocked:**
  - Anterior ethmoidal nerve
  - Greater palatine nerve
  - Lesser palatine nerve
- **Indication:** Only if nasal intubation is intended.
- **Recommendation:** Topical vasoconstriction is highly recommended.
- **Methods:**
  - Cotton-tipped swabs with lignocaine or cocaine
	- Phenylephrine can be used.
	- Swabs should be left in place for 10 minutes.

### Glossopharyngeal Nerve Block

- **Sensory Innervation:**
  - Posterior third of the tongue
  - Vallecula
  - Anterior epiglottis
  - Wall of the pharynx
  - Tonsil
- **Topical Application:** Blocks tactile receptors of the mucosa, but inadequate for blocking submucosal deep pressure receptors.
- **Approaches:**
  - **Intraoral:**
	- Procedure: Open mouth, visualize base of posterior tonsil.
	- **Indications:** Long-lasting, used for treatment of neuralgia and obliteration of the gag reflex.
  - **Extraoral:**
	- **Peristyloid approach**
	- **Risks:** Increased risk of upper airway obstruction, concomitant block of hypoglossal and vagus nerves.

### Superior Laryngeal Nerve Block

- **Components:**
  - **Internal:**
	- Sensory Innervation: Base of tongue, posterior epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids.
	- Effects: Abolish glottic closure reflex.
	- Motor Innervation: None.
	- Procedure: Identify hyoid bone, pierce thyrohyoid membrane.
	- Risks: Vessel puncture, hematoma, local anaesthetic toxicity.
  - **External:**
	- Sensory Innervation: Anterior subglottic mucosa.
	- Motor Innervation: Cricothyroid muscle.
	- Procedure: Remain superficial to thyrohyoid membrane.

### Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve

- **Function:**
  - Supplies all muscles of the larynx except cricothyroid.
  - Provides visceral sensation to vocal cords and infraglottic area.
  - Anesthesia for the infraglottic larynx and upper trachea.

## Topical Agents

### Lignocaine

- **Advantages:**
  - Readily available
  - Low CNS and CVS toxicity
  - Quick onset
  - Clinically useful duration
- **Concentration:**
  - 1-2% for nerve blocks
  - 2-4% for topical application
- **Maximum Dose:**
  - 9 mg/kg

### Vasoconstrictors

- Adrenaline
- Phenylephrine
- Oxymetazoline

## Methods of Topicalization

- **Gargling:**
  - Use 2-4% lignocaine.
  
- **Aspiration:**
  - Pull tongue forward to avoid swallowing.
- **Nebulisation:**
  - Use 2-4% lignocaine for 15-30 minutes.
- **Atomisation:**
  - Atomize lignocaine for effective topicalization.

# Awake Fibre-optic Intubation

## Introduction
- **Gold Standard:** AFOI is the gold standard for managing anticipated difficult airways without airway obstruction.
- **Indications:** Used for supraglottic airway obstruction; caution required at the laryngeal level to avoid "cork in a bottle" effect.
- **Perioperative Strategy:** Ensure strategies that maintain patient oxygenation and ventilation.

### ASA Guidelines
- **Algorithm Position:** Note the specific position of AFOI in the ASA guidelines for difficult airway management.
- **Role Limitation:** No role for fibre-optic bronchoscope if laryngoscopy and mask ventilation are impossible after induction.
- **Data Limitation:** Recommendations are sometimes based on expert opinion and consensus due to lack of hard evidence.

### NAP4 Findings
- **Underuse of AFOI:** Highlighted in the Fourth National Audit Project of the Royal College of Anaesthetists.
- **Failure Factors:**
  - Lack of experience
  - Inappropriate sedation
  - Inability to view landmarks
  - Endotracheal tube impingement during railroading
- **Poor Planning:** Contributes to poor outcomes; plan for failure of the primary airway strategy.

### Advantages of Awake State for AFOI
- **Spontaneous Ventilation:** Maintained
- **Oxygenation and Ventilation:** Preserved
- **Anatomy and Muscle Tone:** Maintained, facilitating intubation
- **Airway Protection:** Preserved
- **Safety and Options:** Enhanced

## Definition of a Difficult Airway
- **ASA Definition:** Difficulty with facemask ventilation, supraglottic device ventilation, tracheal intubation, or all three.
- **Difficult Intubation:**
  - Outright failure
  - Cormack and Lehane grade 3 or 4 laryngoscopy
  - Need for specialist equipment or more than 2 intubation attempts

## Indications for AFOI
- **Primary Indication:** Suspected or known difficult airway.
- **Isolated Difficulty:** Asleep technique may be appropriate if mask ventilation is easy but tracheal intubation is difficult.
- **Partially Obstructed Airway:** Debate exists regarding the role of AFOI.
- **Avoid Iatrogenic Injury:** E.g., unstable C-spine.
  - Incidence of secondary cervical injury due to intubation is very small.
  - High use of AFOI in patients with cervical spine disease, especially with myelopathy or unstable vertebrae.
  - No data suggesting AFOI improves outcomes in cervical spine injury compared to other methods.

### Specific Indications
- Suspected or known difficult airway
- Anticipated difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation
- Anticipated difficult mask ventilation
- Anticipated difficult rescue technique
- Avoidance of iatrogenic injury (e.g., unstable C-spine)

## Contra-indications
### Absolute
- Patient refusal or non-compliance

### Relative
- Lack of skill/equipment
- Critical airway obstruction
- Contamination of upper airway
- Grossly distorted anatomy
- Local anaesthetic allergy
- Penetrating eye injury
- Aspiration risk
- Nasal route: Fractured base of skull
- Coagulopathy

## Difficult Airway with Impending Obstruction
- **Risk:** AFOI can precipitate complete obstruction.
- **Success Factors:** Skill, understanding of obstruction level, recognition of advanced glottic obstruction failure.

## Patients at Risk of Aspiration
- **Debate:** Exists regarding airway topicalisation and AFOI use.
- **Success Reports:** With precautions (e.g., aspiration prophylaxis, semi-sitting position).
- **Avoid Blocks:** Transtracheal and possibly superior laryngeal nerve blocks.
- **Safer Techniques:** Spray-as-you-go may be safer.
- **Postoperative Care:** Oral intake only after return of cough and swallowing reflexes.

## The Flexible Bronchoscope
### Types
- Fibre-optic bronchoscope
- Video bronchoscope

### Fibre-optic Bronchoscope
- **Components:** Bundles of optical fibres (8-25μm diameter) for image transmission, light transmission fibres, control lever cables.
- **Functions:** Aspiration of secretions, local anaesthetic installation.
- **Display:** Image can be shown on a monitor via camera attachment.

### Video Bronchoscope
- **Video Chip:** Distal video chip transmits image electronically to a display.

### Maneuvering the Scope
- **Planes:**
  - Tip flexion-extension
  - Rotation of entire scope
  - Advance-withdrawal of entire scope
- **Handling:** Keep the scope's external portion straight; use the dominant hand for finer movements and the non-dominant hand for control lever and suction valve.

### Common Problems
- **ETT Hold Up:**
  - Most common sites: Inter-arytenoid notch, right arytenoid cartilage, and epiglottis.
  - Hold up more likely with significant size discrepancy between scope and ETT.
  - **Technique:** Advance ETT with bevel facing posteriorly; if hold up occurs, withdraw 1-2 cm, rotate 90 degrees anticlockwise, and advance.
  - **Caution:** Never force the ETT; consider special ETT with soft tapered end if necessary.

### Nasal Vs Oral Intubation

- **Surgical Considerations:** The type of surgery may dictate the route of intubation.
  - **Nasal Route:**
	- Technically easier with a less acute angle for the bronchoscope.
	- Better tolerated and can function as a nasopharyngeal airway post-extubation.
  - **Oral Route:**
	- Berman and Ovassapian airways facilitate passage of fibre-optic scope and endotracheal tube through the mouth.
	- Measure the distance from the corner of the mouth to the ear, equivalent to the distance from mouth opening to glottis.

### Airway Innervation

- **Nasal Cavity:**
  - Anterior third of the nasal septum and flares: Ethmoidal nerve (branch of CN 1).
  - Posterior cavity: Branches of the maxillary nerve (trigeminal nerve).
  - Greater and lesser palatine nerves from the pterygopalatine ganglion innervate the turbinates and nasal septum.
  - Pterygopalatine ganglion located posterior to the middle turbinate in the pterygopalatine fossa.
- **Oropharynx:**
  - Innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve with motor and sensory fibers.
  - Sensory innervation to the posterior third of the tongue, vallecula, anterior epiglottis, pharyngeal walls, and tonsils.
- **Larynx:**
  - Branches of the vagus nerve innervate the larynx and trachea.
  - Internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve provides sensation above the vocal cords.
  - Recurrent laryngeal nerve provides sensory supply to the vocal cords and below, and motor supply to intrinsic laryngeal muscles (except cricothyroid, innervated by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve).

### Anaesthetising the Airway

- **Aim:** Reduce sensation to mitigate undesirable autonomic responses and improve operator success.

### Techniques of Airway Anaesthesia

- **Nebulizers:** Entire airway
- **Topical Sprays and Gels:** Upper airway
- **Spray-as-you-go:** Larynx and trachea
- **Transtracheal Injection:** Larynx and trachea
- **Nerve Blocks:** Distribution of nerve supply
- **Combinations of the above**

**Topical Anaesthesia:**

- **Topicalisation:** Spreading local anaesthetic over the mucosa for local uptake and neural block.
  - Requires adequate time for optimal conditions.
  - Can reduce airway calibre, risking obstruction in critically narrowed airways. Only experts should perform this with a ready surgical team.
- **Agents:**
  - **Lignocaine:** Most widely used, favorable safety profile. Can be combined with vasoconstrictors (e.g., adrenaline, phenylephrine) to prolong effect.
  - **Cocaine:** Less favored due to sympathomimetic activity and risk of cardiac issues.
- **Dosage:** Maximum 9 mg/kg lean body mass for lignocaine in adults.
  - Monitor cumulative local anaesthetic dose, especially if the surgeon may use more.
  - Therapeutic range is narrow; toxicity is dose-related, with a plasma threshold of 5 mg/L.
  - Hyperaemia, oedema, hypercarbia, and hepatic dysfunction can enhance systemic absorption and toxicity.
- **Administration:**
  - Nebulised, spray-as-you-go, gargled, soaked pledgets, airway blocks.
  - Nebulised lignocaine may need spray-as-you-go supplementation for consistent anaesthesia.
  - Spray-as-you-go technique useful at vocal cords and below, but causes coughing, requiring recovery time.
  - Lignocaine-soaked swabs or pledgets, used with vasoconstrictors, can provide targeted anaesthesia.

**Airway Nerve Blocks:**

- Provide profound, longer-lasting anaesthesia but are invasive and potentially uncomfortable.
- **Nose:** Lignocaine-soaked swabs.
- **Oropharynx:** Glossopharyngeal nerve block for gag reflex suppression.
  - **Intraoral Approach:** Anaesthetise tongue, inject lignocaine at posterior tonsillar pillar.
  - **Extraoral (Peristyloid) Approach:** Identify styloid process, inject lignocaine after aspiration.
  - Risks include vascular injection and significant absorption, contraindicated in coagulopathy or anticoagulant use.
- **Larynx:** Superior laryngeal nerve block and recurrent laryngeal nerve block (transtracheal).
  - **Superior Laryngeal Nerve Block:**
	- Bilateral injections at the greater cornu of the hyoid bone.
	- Supine patient, head extended, palpate and inject lignocaine after aspiration.
	- Alternative: Soaked pledgets in pyriform fossa.
  - **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Block (Transtracheal):**
	- Locate cricothyroid membrane, inject lignocaine after aspirating air.
	- Cough disperses the anaesthetic, blocking sensory branches.

| **Larynx**     | Superior laryngeal nerve (internal branch), Recurrent laryngeal nerve | Greater cornu hyoid bone, Transtracheal injection               |

### Antisialogogue

Oral secretions can obstruct visualization and hinder the effective penetration of local anaesthetic into the mucosa. Recommended antisialogogues:

- Glycopyrrolate: 3-4 µg/kg IV, administered 30 minutes preoperatively.
- Atropine: 0.5-1 mg IM/IV.

### Sedation

- **Safety:** The primary safety of AFOI is the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation and the ability to switch techniques if intubation fails.
- **Sedation Use:** Generally accepted in non-obstructed airways.
  - Pros: Assists with patient compliance, enhancing intubation success.
  - Cons: Risk of airway obstruction, respiratory depression, or apnea, which can lead to significant morbidity or mortality (NAP4).

#### Guidelines for Safe Sedation
- **Patient Selection:** Avoid sedation in patients with airway obstruction or respiratory failure.
- **Drug Selection:** Choose appropriate drugs based on patient and pathology.
- **Sedationist:** A second anaesthetist should administer and monitor sedation effects.

#### Goals of Sedation
- Cooperative patient
- Maintenance of patient's own airway
- Minimal respiratory depression

#### Evidence and Drug Selection
- **Review:** A recent review (Can J Anaesth 2013) examined the efficacy, doses, techniques, and limitations of sedatives for AFOI, including benzodiazepines, opioids, propofol, alpha-2 agonists, and ketamine.
- **Recommended Agents:** Remifentanil and dexmedetomidine have strong evidence supporting their use.

#### Sedative Characteristics
- Ideal sedative for AFOI should:
  - Provide anxiolysis
  - Have analgesic properties
  - Suppress cough and gag reflex
  - Be safe and easy to titrate
  - Have minimal respiratory and cardiovascular side effects
  - Have an antidote

#### Common Sedatives
- **Benzodiazepines:**
  - Commonly used (e.g., Midazolam) with an opioid.
  - Advantages: Wide availability, user experience, and antidote (flumazenil).
  - Disadvantages: Risk of oversedation with bolus injection, wide inter-patient variability.
- **Propofol:**
  - Often used in TCI technique with/without remifentanil.
  - Studies: Remifentanil and dexmedetomidine superior in intubating conditions; propofol has lower recall but higher oversedation risk.
  - Dose range: Risk increases with concentrations >3 µg/mL.
- **Opioids:**
  - Useful for intense nociceptive stimulation during intubation.
  - **Remifentanil:** Preferred for AFOI.
	- Ultra-short acting, easy to titrate.
	- Dose range for TCI: Cet 3-5 ng/mL with midazolam or propofol.
	- Can be used alone at <3 ng/mL with adequate topicalization.
- **Dexmedetomidine:**
  - Alpha-2 agonist with sedative, antisialogogue, anxiolytic, and moderate analgesic properties.
  - Advantages: No respiratory depressant effect, high patient tolerance.
  - Dose: 1 µg/kg bolus over 10 minutes, followed by 0.3-0.7 µg/kg/hr infusion.
  - Adverse Effects: Hypotension, bradycardia, transient hypertensive response.

### Properties and Adverse Effects of Remifentanil, Dexmedetomidine, and Propofol for Conscious Sedation for AFOI

| **Property**              | **Remifentanil** | **Dexmedetomidine** | **Propofol** |
|---------------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Patient satisfaction**  | High             | High                | High         |
| **Recall of events**      | High             | Variable            | High         |
| **Risk of oversedation**  | Low              | Low                 | High         |
| **Airway obstruction**    | No               | No                  | Yes          |
| **Bradycardia**           | No               | Yes                 | No           |
| **Hypotension**           | No               | Yes                 | Yes          |
| **Respiratory depression**| Yes              | No                  | Yes          |
| **Coughing**              | No               | Variable            | Yes          |

### Supplemental Oxygen
- **Administration:** Via nasal prongs or an upside-down face mask to provide a safety barrier against airway obstruction.
  - Caution: Avoid using supplemental oxygen with sedatives that suppress respiration (e.g., remifentanil) as it may mask hypoventilation and hypercapnia.
  - Preference: Some prefer relying on patient oxygen saturation as a prompt to encourage breathing rather than supplemental oxygen.

### Complications of AFOI
- Failure
- Bleeding
- Complete airway obstruction
- Oversedation
- Laryngeal trauma and arytenoid dislocation
- Local anaesthetic toxicity

### Training
- **Importance:** Complications from airway management are a significant cause of anaesthesia-related morbidity and mortality.
  - Severe outcomes: Hypoxic brain injury, death.
- **Training Programs:** Many lack structured airway management programs.
  - Survey: Majority of final-year trainees fail to reach competency targets for AFOI.
- **Stepwise Approach to Training:**
  - Mannequins: Provide a safe introduction; 2-4 hours of training can prepare for patient intubation.
  - Asleep fibre-optic intubation with predicted normal anatomy.
  - Awake fibre-optic intubation with predicted normal anatomy.
  - Awake fibre-optic intubation with predicted abnormal anatomy.
