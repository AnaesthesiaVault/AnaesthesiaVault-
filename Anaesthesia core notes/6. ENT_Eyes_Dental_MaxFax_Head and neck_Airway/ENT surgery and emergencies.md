# Update on ENT Anaesthesia (Paediatrics)

## Introduction
- Majority of ENT surgeries in paediatrics performed as day case procedures.
  - High-turnover list
  - Shared airway
  - Co-morbidities with anesthetic significance
  - Including associated syndromes
  - Increasing incidence of obesity and its clinical sequelae
  - Increased risk of perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAE) and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)

## Preoperative Assessment

### 1) Recent Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)
- Active or recent infection within the last 4 weeks with moist cough, green runny nose, and fever increases risk of PRAE:
  - Oxygen desaturation
  - Bronchospasm
  - Cough
  - Laryngospasm
  - Airway obstruction
- Consider proceeding with surgery if:
  - Less severe symptoms of active URTI
  - Non-body cavity and non-airway surgery
  - Strategies to mitigate risks of PRAE:
	- Salbutamol premedication
	- Avoidance of airway instrumentation
	- Minimization or avoidance of irritant volatile anesthetic
- PRAE associated with URTI particularly common with airway surgery if child intubated
  - Decision to proceed guided by:
	- Child’s symptoms
	- Co-morbidities
	- Comfort of anaesthetist in managing children with URTI
	- Type of surgery planned

### 2) Obesity
#### WHO Reference 2007 for Definitions of Overweight and Obesity in Children
**2–5 years (Use weight-for-age)**  
- Overweight: >97th percentile  
- Obesity: >99.9th percentile  
- Severe obesity: Not applicable  

**5–10 years (Use weight-for-age)**  
- Overweight: >85th percentile  
- Obesity: >97th percentile  
- Severe obesity: >99.9th percentile  

**10–19 years (Use BMI-for-age)**  
- Overweight: >85th percentile  
- Obesity: >97th percentile  
- Severe obesity: >99.9th percentile  
- 35% of children in the USA are overweight
  - Associated with specific comorbidities:
	- Asthma
	- Hypertension
	- Sleep-disordered breathing
	  - In an obese child, usually a mixed picture of obstructive sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoventilation.

### 3) Diabetes
- Higher incidence of difficult bag-mask ventilation
- PRAE more likely to be severe and require intervention such as reintubation for airway obstruction
- Calculation of ideal body weight for drug dosing when using TIVA and opioids
- May require continued post-op monitoring
- May not be suitable for day case surgery

### 4) Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)
- OSA: Most common indication for adenotonsillectomy in children
- Severity of SDB dictates suitability for day case surgery
- 1 in 5 children have been diagnosed with primary snoring
- OSA affects ~1-3% of children with peak incidence between 3 and 6 years old

#### Consequences of OSA
- **Cardiovascular**
  - Right ventricular dysfunction causing pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale
  - Left ventricular dysfunction and systemic hypertension
  - Cardiac changes can occur in even mild OSA
- **Increased risk of postoperative respiratory complications:**
  - Reduced ventilatory response to arterial carbon dioxide tensions (exacerbated by general anaesthesia). These children are less able to “rescue” themselves from obstructive episode postoperatively.
  - Increased sensitivity to opioids. They require half the standard opioid dose to achieve adequate analgesia.
- **Neurological complications**
  - Behavioural problems and learning difficulties
- Severity of OSA often underestimated:
  - Polysomnography is the gold standard investigation: resource-intensive and requires overnight stay in hospital

#### Signs and Symptoms Suggestive of Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Children

**Night-time symptoms**
- Snoring
- Apnoea
- Arousals or wakening
- Restless sleep
- Night sweats
- Difficult to rouse in the morning

**Day-time symptoms**
- Day-time sleepiness (rare in children with OSA)
- Hyperactivity
- Poor concentration
- Lethargy
- Social withdrawal
- Poor school performance

**Signs**
- Obesity
- Tonsillar hypertrophy
- Mouth-breathing
- Failure to thrive

Diagnosed clinically from history and examination

- Questionnaires to screen for OSA have poor specificity
- Anaesthetist has to make decision whether child can be anaesthetised safely as a day case and whether further cardio-respiratory evaluation is required preoperatively.

### Key Points for Anaesthetizing a Child with Possible OSA

**Preoperative management:**
- Assess in preoperative assessment clinic
- Identify OSA on history and examination, assess severity
- Decide if child requires further investigation or cardiorespiratory assessment
- Consideration of suitability for day case procedure

**Intraoperative management:**
- Indications for the use, or avoidance, of sedative premedication
- Inhalational induction may be more problematic with risk of upper airway obstruction
- Indication for use of laryngeal mask airway rather than endotracheal tube
- Awake extubation, possibly using a nasal airway
- Reduced dose of intraoperative opioids as sensitive, due to chronic hypoxia

**Postoperative management:**
- Increased risk of postoperative respiratory complication

### 4) Congenital Syndromes
- Commonly encountered:
  - Down syndrome
	- Often require middle ear surgery which is more challenging due to narrow external auditory canals
	- T and A for OSA
  - Branchial arch abnormalities
	- Present for reconstructive ear surgery and may be difficult to intubate
  - Cleft lip/palate
	- May be isolated or part of a syndrome
- Cardiac associations
# Common ENT Procedures

## Myringotomy and Tympanoplasty Tubes

#### Anaesthetic Considerations
- Quick procedure performed as a day case
- Emphasis on appropriate analgesia and quick recovery

#### Preoperatively
- Many children have had procedure before: anxiety around repeat anaesthetics
- Analgesia with oral paracetamol with or without NSAID is appropriate
- Identify children with recent or active URTI

#### Intraoperatively
- Airway maintained with facemask or LMA with spontaneous breathing
- Anti-emesis: ondansetron 0.15mg/kg IV
- Intra-operative opioid for children with repeat procedure: fentanyl 1mcg/kg

#### Postoperatively
- IV opioids rarely required
- Analgesia requirements variable between children

## Adenotonsillectomy

### Introduction
- Most commonly performed operation in children.
  - Primary indication is to treat OSA in younger children and recurrent infection in older children.
  - Surgery is often as a day case.

### Anaesthetic Considerations
- OSA and its complications
- Shared airway
- Potential difficult airway (obstruction, bleeding)
- Balancing management of post-operative pain and risk of postoperative airway complications
- PONV
- Post-operative bleeding

#### Preoperatively
- Identify patients at high risk for postoperative respiratory complications (should be considered for overnight admission for monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry):
  - Age younger than 3 years
  - Failure to thrive
  - Obesity
  - History of prematurity
  - Recent URTI within last 4 weeks
  - Craniofacial anomalies
  - Neuromuscular disorders
  - Cor pulmonale
  - Systemic hypertension
- Enquire about bleeding diatheses
- Identify risk factors for PONV
- Premedication should include paracetamol and NSAID unless contraindicated.
  - Cochrane report in 2010: No increase in postoperative bleeding when using NSAIDs.
  - NSAIDs have added benefit of reducing PONV: either due to improved pain control or reduced opioid use.

#### Intraoperative Management
- Opioids usually required
  - Avoid opioid-induced respiratory complications in children with OSA
  - Use adjuncts: ketamine, dexmedetomidine, dexamethasone, and bathing tonsil bed in local anesthetic.
	- Dexmedetomidine is a potent and highly selective α2-adrenergic receptor agonist with sedative and analgesic properties.
	- Useful adjunct in obese children: it does not decrease pharyngeal tone or cause respiratory depression.
	- A meta-analysis showed relative risk reduction in postoperative pain and opioid requirements.
	- Reduced incidence of emergence delirium.
	- Bolus dose of 0.5-1 mcg/kg slowly post-induction.
	- A study in OSA patients showed improved analgesia, lower incidence of emergence delirium, and fewer episodes of desaturation in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) when treated with dexmedetomidine compared to fentanyl.
	- Clonidine is an effective alternative to dexmedetomidine.
- Use of reinforced LMA has been shown to decrease postoperative pain requirements
- PONV prophylaxis: IV ondansetron 50mcg/kg (max 4mg) and IV dexamethasone 150mcg/kg (max 8 mg)

#### Postoperative
- Reduced opioid use with regular paracetamol and NSAIDs.
- Eating and drinking should be voluntary to reduce the incidence of vomiting
- 9% of children less than 4 have an unplanned admission following adenotonsillectomy
  - Commonly as a consequence of vomiting (5.2%)
  - Surgical reasons (1.7%)
- Primary haemorrhage (within 6 hours) is a serious complication, but it’s uncommon.
- Any child who has a respiratory complication in the immediate postoperative period is at greater risk of having a further event within the following 24 hour period.
- Codeine:
  - Use is decreasing due to a handful of deaths reported in children discharged on codeineblack box warning.
  - Highest risk in children who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine.

## Removal of Inhaled Foreign Body

### Introduction
- Common in children under 3 years.
- Diagnosis made from history, examination, and radiography.
- Organic materials are the most common culprits: nuts and seeds.
- Rigid bronchoscopy is needed to retrieve the foreign body.

### Anaesthetic Considerations
- Emergency: expedite if child symptomatic.
- If child is stable, many centres will wait until normal working hours.

### Preoperatively
- History to determine the likely object.
- Fasting is important but may be impractical if child is deteriorating.
- Physical examination:
  - Wheeze
  - Stridor
  - Decreased air entry
- Interventions that distress the child should be avoided as it may worsen respiratory status.
- Radiography:
  - Determine the likely position of FB.
  - In a review of 13000 patients, 11% of foreign bodies were radio-opaque and only 17% of patients had a normal CXR.

### Intraoperatively
- Spontaneous breathing vs PPV:
  - Advantage of spontaneous breathing is improved ventilation/perfusion matching and decreased risk of barotrauma. Disadvantages: frequent desaturations and respiratory acidosis.
  - PPV:
	- Better oxygenation and ventilation
	- Better operating conditions
	- Decreased recovery time
	- Requires fewer opioids
  - Ventilation performed through port on rigid bronchoscope or with jet ventilation via tracheal catheter.
- Traditionally performed with sevoflurane based anaesthetic.
- Alternative is propofol and remifentanil TIVA.
  - Better control over depth of anaesthesia
  - Less pollution of operating theatre
- Propofol and dexmedetomidine TIVA: more stable respiratory and haemodynamic profiles compared to propofol and remi.
- Recipe example:
  - Propofol and Remi TIVA combined with dexmedetomidine.
  - Spontaneous ventilation
  - Increase level of anaesthesia till respiratory rate halves
  - Spray vocal cords with lignocaine to depress laryngeal reflexes and reduce risk of coughing with scope

### Postoperatively
- Incidence of adverse events 9.5%:
  - Desaturation
  - Haemorrhage
  - Laryngospasm
  - Pneumothorax
- If the patient was symptomatic, complication rate was almost 4 times higher (36.5%)
- Postoperative destination decided on a case-by-case basis.
## Middle Ear Surgery
### Mastoidectomy, Myringoplasty, and Cochlear Implantation

#### Anaesthetic Considerations
- Presence of co-existing syndrome
- Long procedure with minimal stimulation
- "Bloodless" surgical field
- PONV prophylaxis
- Difficult airway access
- Facial nerve monitoring
- Potentially a day case procedure

#### Preoperatively
- Premedication with paracetamol with or without NSAID
- Assess for bleeding diatheses and risk factors for PONV
- Assess for URTI and Otitis media: children at risk for bacterial meningitis
- Children with sensorineural hearing deficit should have ECG to exclude long QT syndrome (part of Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome)

#### Intraoperatively
- Operations can be prolonged, non-stimulating and access to airway can be difficult.
- Topicalising vocal cords with local anaesthetic may help to prevent coughing on extubation.
- TIVA is an option to improve tolerance of endotracheal tube, decrease risk of PONV and avoid fluctuations in BP.
- Avoiding hypertension and hypercarbia can assist in decreasing bleeding in operative field.
- High risk of PONV: single agent prophylaxis with ondansetron 150mcg/kg and dual therapy (add dexamethasone 150mcg/kg) if other risk factors for PONV present.
  - TIVA, IV hydration and avoiding long acting opioids decrease risk of PONV.
- Intra-operative facial nerve monitoring: avoid muscle relaxants.
  - If muscle relaxant required for intubation, choose agent and dose that ensures rapid return of function.

#### Postoperatively
- Pain and PONV most common problems: pre-emptive analgesia and anti-emesis
- Bleeding is a rare occurrence
- PACU staff require skills to manage children with a hearing deficit
- Cochlear implants are only activated after a couple of weeks: hearing deficit will be unchanged in PACU.

### Surgery for Congenital Ear Defects

#### Anaesthetic Considerations
- Microtia (external ear deformity) or atresia (absent ear canal)
- Often associated with severe hearing loss in affected ear.
- Can be idiopathic or associated with syndrome involving first or second branchial arch.
  - Assess for comorbidities and likelihood of difficult intubation.
- Single or multi-stage reconstructive surgery or insertion of temporal screws to enable attachment of bone-anchored hearing aids.

#### Preoperatively
- Standard airway assessment: potential for difficult bag-mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, and LMA insertion.
  - Mandibular hypoplasia can make this difficult.
- Review previous anaesthetic records.
- Anticholinergic agents to reduce airway secretions.

#### Intraoperatively
- ETT first choice for securing airway in long cases
  - LMA in shorter cases (bear in mind difficult access to airway in the case of a problem)
- Longer cases:
  - Normothermia
  - Pressure care
  - Fluid management
  - Invasive monitoring at own discretion

#### Postoperatively
- Pain difficult to assess in children with deafness/learning difficulties associated with syndromes.
## Laser Surgery of the Larynx

### Laser is Used For
- **Laryngeal Papillomata Treatment**
  - Caused by human papilloma virus
  - Commonly affects children younger than 10, peak incidence at 4 years
  - Severe laryngeal obstruction can occur
  - No curative treatment: repeated surgical removal of recurrent tumor is necessary every 6-12 weeks
  - Laser or endoscopic micro-debridement
  - Interval between treatments lengthens, and children often grow out of disease in adolescence.
- **Supraglottoplasty or Epiglottopexy for Laryngomalacia**
- **Tracheo-oesophageal Fistula Remnant Marsupialization**
- **Haemangiomata**
- **Oral Lesions**

### Anaesthetic Considerations
- Complete airway obstruction is a possibility
- Standard laser safety protocol should be followed
- Arrange post-operative care

#### Preoperatively
- History and examination:
  - Surgical and radiological input to assess anatomical location of the lesion, degree of airway obstruction and its nature (fixed, dynamic or both).
  - Review anaesthetic records from previous surgery
  - Avoid sedative premedication

#### Intraoperatively
- Method of anaesthesia depends on:
  - The child
  - Degree of airway obstruction
  - Surgical and anesthetic preference
  - Surgeon should be in theatre prior to induction
  - Equipment ready (surgical tracheostomy or rigid bronchoscope) in case airway gets compromised.
- Inhalational induction or TIVA technique with propofol and remifentanil ± dexmedetomidine
- Anaesthetise airway with topical local anaesthetic and maintain adequate depth of anaesthesia.
- Laser-resistant ETT not available in smaller sizes
  - Risk for airway fire with standard tube
  - Standard ETT can be removed prior to laser use and re-inserted
  - Alternative technique: suspension laryngoscopy with insufflation of oxygen via surgical laryngoscope.
- Spontaneous ventilation preferred:
  - High frequency jet ventilation may cause seeding of papillomata within the airway or barotrauma.
- Extubation only when child is awake, obeying commands, and spontaneously ventilating
  - Examine oropharynx for bleeding or secretions before extubation.

#### Postoperatively
- Location and level of care determined preoperatively.
- Bleeding and oedema typically minimal after laser surgery
- Obstructive symptoms often show immediate improvement.
- If topical anesthesia used, keep NPO for 2 hours postoperatively.
# ENT Emergencies

## Stridor

### Definition
- Harsh, predominantly inspiratory noise, caused by partial upper airway obstruction.
- Medical emergency that requires urgent intubation or tracheostomy.

### Causes of Stridor
#### Acute
- Infection: Epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess, croup
- Foreign bodies: Aspiration of coin, peanut, etc.
- Airway oedema: Anaphylaxis, following instrumentation of the airway, drug reaction (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors)
- Acute exacerbation of chronic condition

#### Chronic
- Malignancy: Supraglottic tumours, base of tongue tumours, laryngeal papillomatosis
- Subglottic stenosis: Following prolonged intubation
- Laryngomalacia

### Management
- Administer 100% oxygen via a face-mask, with the patient sitting upright.
- Nebulized adrenaline 1 mg (1 ml) of 1:1000 made up to 5 ml with 0.9% saline (repeated every 30 min, with ECG monitoring).
- Intravenous dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg, 6-hourly. This will help reduce airway oedema, but may take 4-6 hours to work.
- Consider inhaled heliox (70% helium, 30% oxygen). Its density is less than that of air, promoting laminar flow within the airway.
- Fibre-optic nasendoscopy helpful in assessing airway.
- CT of neck/thorax may be indicated to locate site and extent of obstruction.
- Communication/planning with ENT surgeons.

### Clinical Presentation
- **Larynx and Trachea:** Acute respiratory distress, hoarseness, stridor, and SOB.
- **Bronchi:** Wheeze, cough, haemoptysis, SOB, and respiratory distress.
- **Lower Airway:** Usually asymptomatic unless secondary infection.

### Clinical Grades of Stridor
- **Grade 1 (Exertional stridor):** Stridor appears during crying or exercise.
- **Grade 2 (Continuous stridor or stridor at rest):** Stridor is present at rest and becomes worse with exertion. Infants < 1 yr of age should be hospitalized.
- **Grade 3 (Stridor with retractions):** Stridor is continuous and accompanied with suprasternal and supraclavicular retractions. The patient looks anxious, irritable, and struggling for breathing. Hospitalization is indicated for all cases.
- **Grade 4 (Stridor with cyanosis):** In addition to continuous stridor and retractions, cyanosis and altered consciousness occur, denoting severe respiratory failure. Urgent hospitalization and ET intubation, or tracheostomy indicated.

### Factors Associated with Postintubation Laryngeal Edema
- Age <4 yr
- Tight-fitting endotracheal tube, no audible leak at or below 25 cm H₂O pressure
- Traumatic or repeated intubation
- Prolonged intubation
- Overinflation of endotracheal tube cuff
- Inadequate anesthesia during intubation
- Head repositioning while intubated
- History of infectious or postintubation croup
- Neck or airway surgery
- Upper respiratory tract infection
- Trisomy 21

## Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis)

### General
- Most common cause of stridor in children
- Presents between 6 months and 2 years of age
- Due to viral infection of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi
  - Caused by parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial, and influenza viruses

### Clinical Presentation
- Gradual onset of a ‘barking’ cough.
- Children rarely appear toxic (as with epiglottitis).

### Management
- As for ‘Stridor’.
- Nebulized budesonide 2 mg may also help.
- Monitor after treatment, as mucosal swelling may recur.
- Intubation is only required for severe cases and should be managed as for ‘epiglottitis’.

## Acute Epiglottitis

### General
- Acute inflammation and swelling of epiglottis and other supraglottic structures which cause obstruction of laryngeal inlet.
- Can precipitate complete occlusion of the upper airway
- Cause usually bacterial:
  - Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), group A Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus aureus, and β-haemolytic streptococci.
- Rare in children due to Hib vaccine
  - Streptococci responsible for epiglottitis in vaccinated children
- Incidence in adults increased because of frequent use of antibiotics in childhood

### Clinical Presentation
- Most commonly children aged 2-5 years (may occur in adults)
- Acute onset of fever, sore throat, and rapid deterioration of the airway.
- The child is unwell, with drooling, dysphagia, and stridor. Laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) is the main differential diagnosis.

### Initial Management
- Seek senior anaesthetic, paediatric, and ENT input.
- Try to keep the child and parents calm.
- Complete airway obstruction may be provoked by: pharyngeal examination, intravenous cannulation, or excessive excitement.

### Anaesthetic Management
- Urgent transfer to the operating theatre/anaesthetic room.
- A senior surgeon competent at performing paediatric tracheostomy should be present.
- Inhalational induction with 100% oxygen and either sevoflurane or halothane, with the child in a sitting position (this may be slow and challenging).
- Intravenous cannulation once the child is anesthetized.
- Intubation is difficultanatomy of the airway is distorted due to oedema.
- Glottic opening may be identified by the presence of air bubbles emerging from the laryngeal inlet.
- Oral tracheal tubes that are 0.5-1.5 mm (ID) smaller than normal should be available.

### Further Management
- Laryngeal and blood cultures before commencing antibiotics.
- Intravenous cefotaxime 50 mg/kg every 8-12 hours.
- Normal visualization of the glottis and presence of a leak around the tube indicates oedema has settled.
- Extubation is normally within 36 hours.

### Adults with Epiglottitis
- Initial management as for stridor
  - Should include IV antibiotics and plan for securing airway
- Anaesthetic management:
  - Inhalation induction is slow and may be difficult, resulting in worsening obstruction and breath-holding.
  - Rapid-sequence induction using intravenous induction agents and muscle relaxants can be used.
  - Tracheostomy under local anaesthesia may be difficult to perform in a patient with severe respiratory distress.
  - Awake fibreoptic intubation may precipitate complete airway obstruction.
## Inhaled Foreign Body

### Types of Obstruction

1. **Bypass Valve Effect**
	- Partial obstruction on inspiration and expiration
2. **Check Valve Effect**
	- Obstruction on exhalation but allows air in
	- CXR: Hyperinflation of ipsilateral lung
3. **Stop Valve Effect**
	- Complete obstruction
	- CXR: Segmental collapse of lung
4. **Ball Valve Effect**
	- Obstruction on inhalation but allows air out
	- CXR: Atelectasis

### General Information

- **Prevalence**: Most common indication for bronchoscopy in children aged 1-3 years.
- **Effects of Aspiration**: Depend on nature, duration, degree, and site of the foreign body (FB).
	- **Larynx and Trachea**: Acute dyspnoea, stridor, coughing, and cyanosis
		- Heimlich maneuver may be required to dislodge the obstruction
	- **Bronchus**: Wheeze, cough, and dyspnoea with decreased air entry on the obstructed side
- **Diagnostic Challenges**: CXR may not show FB as most are radiolucent
	- Positive history and symptoms of aspiration guide diagnosis
	- Non-problematic obstructions may present later with mucosal irritation, oedema, and pneumonitis distal to the obstruction
	- Peanuts may cause intense bronchial inflammatory reactions

### Management

- **Pre-Induction**:
	- Ensure the child is adequately fasted
	- Avoid premedication with sedative agents
	- Intravenous cannulation
	- Administer atropine 20 mg/kg (max 600 mg) to reduce secretions and reflex bradycardia
- **Induction and Maintenance**:
	- Use 100% oxygen and either sevoflurane or halothane (induction may be slow)
	- Apply lidocaine spray to the vocal cords to reduce the risk of laryngospasm
	- Insert a ventilating bronchoscope with the child breathing spontaneously
	- Connect Ayre’s T-piece to the bronchoscope side-arm for oxygen and sevoflurane passage
	- Maintain spontaneous ventilation to minimize the risk of distal FB displacement; if needed, use intermittent positive pressure ventilation
	- Ensure sufficient anesthesia to prevent movement, coughing, and laryngospasm. Sevoflurane can be switched to isoflurane or maintained with propofol infusion.
- **Postoperative Care**:
	- Administer IV dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg every 6 hours
	- Provide antibiotics if an infection is suspected

### Complications

- Hypoxia
- Hypercapnia
- Laryngospasm
- Disintegration or dislodgement of FB
- Haemorrhage
- Pneumothorax
- Pneumomediastinum
- Hypoxic brain injury
- Cardiac arrest
- Tracheal obstruction (advance FB back into the bronchus if removal is not possible)
- Administer dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg

## Bleeding Tonsil

### General Information

- Postoperative tonsillar haemorrhage occurs in approximately 1% of children and 3% of adults.
	- Less than 25% require surgical intervention

### Clinical Presentation

- Large volumes of swallowed blood may lead to hypovolemia
- The extent of blood loss is revealed when haemoglobin levels are measured
- Usually involves venous or capillary zone bleeding rather than arterial

### Management

- **General Management**:
	- Obtain wide-bore intravenous access
	- Perform adequate fluid resuscitation and administer blood if indicated
	- Conduct a coagulation screen to rule out undiagnosed bleeding diathesis
- **Anaesthetic Management**:
	- Use intravenous or gaseous induction for bleeding tonsils
	- For rapid-sequence induction:
		- Check previous chart for airway difficulties and appropriate endotracheal tube (ETT) size
		- Consider using an ETT size 1.0 mm smaller due to airway oedema
		- Note that the patient may not tolerate lying supine
		- Preoxygenation, induction, and cricoid pressure may be applied with the patient sitting
		- Direct laryngoscopy may be challenging due to blood pooling in the pharynx; ensure adequate suction is available
		- Insert a wide-bore oral-gastric tube at the beginning and end of the procedure to decompress the stomach and evacuate swallowed blood
		- Extubate the patient when fully awake

### Inhalational vs. Rapid-Sequence Induction (RSI)

| Technique         | Inhalational in Lateral Position                         | IV Rapid-Sequence Induction (RSI)                                                         |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Advantages**    | Maintain spontaneous ventilation and oxygenation         | Decreased risk of aspiration                                                              |
|                   | Clots drain by gravity                                   | Muscle relaxation improves intubating conditions                                          |
|                   | Aim for the bubble for intubation                        | Less stressful for child                                                                  |
| **Disadvantages** | Difficult in anxious, bleeding patients                  | Adequate preoxygenation difficult to achieve                                              |
|                   | CV instability with hypovolaemia (worsened by volatiles) | No bubble in blood to indicate larynx                                                     |
|                   | Difficulty intubating in lateral position                |                                                                                           |
| **Notes**         | Do not use halothane with hypovolaemia                   | Use ketamine or etomidate for induction if CV unstable                                    |
|                   |                                                          | Succinylcholine is the muscle relaxant of choice (unless sugammadex is readily available) |

# Anaesthesia for Direct Laryngoscopy and Microlaryngeal Surgery

## General Considerations
- **Microlaryngeal surgery** involves operating on the larynx with the aid of a microscope.
- **Direct laryngoscopy (DL)** is used for:
  - Assessing laryngeal pathology
  - Performing laryngeal procedures such as laser ablation of localized lesions, nodules, or papillomatosis
- **Anesthesia requirements** include:
  - Adequate depth of anesthesia/sedation
  - An unobstructed and immobile operative field
  - Adequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal
  - Rapid return of airway reflexes post-surgery
- **Cooperation between anesthetist and surgeon** is crucial due to the shared airway.

### Pre-operative Assessment
- **History**:
  - Previous radiotherapy
- **Cardiac and respiratory assessment**
- **Examination**:
  - Presence/absence of stridor
  - Hoarseness/shortness of breath
  - Mallampati score, neck mobility, and dental examination
  - Note poor dentition/gingivitis: may require a gum guard
  - Patients should be warned about potential tooth damage during the procedure
- **Special Investigations**:
  - Recent indirect/nasal fibreoptic endoscopy notes of the larynx
  - Chest X-ray (CXR)
  - CT scans/MRI for assessing subglottic lesions
  - Previous anesthetic notes and latest nasopharyngeal examination report
- **Surgeon's input**:
  - Whether intubation with a microlaryngeal tube (MLT) will provide satisfactory surgical conditions
  - Use of laser

#### If Difficult Intubation is Likely
- Ensure the presence of a difficult airway trolley and Sanders injector or high-frequency jet ventilator in the theatre
- For critical airway stenosis, an experienced surgeon should be present:
  - Tracheostomy under local anesthesia
  - Emergency tracheostomy if needed during induction of anesthesia

#### Anesthetic Technique for Patients with Stridor
- Technique depends on experience and facilities
- Position patient to facilitate intubation
- Commonly preferred approach:
  - Spontaneous ventilation with sevoflurane induction
  - Intermittent spraying of cords with 4% lignocaine
  - Examination of the larynx to decide on muscle relaxant use for intubation
  - Preferable use of suxamethonium
- Alternative approach:
  - Preoxygenation, followed by propofol and suxamethonium (if the previous technique fails, propofol and suxamethonium are used after desaturation)

## Anaesthetic Techniques

### 1. Intubation with Microlaryngeal Tube (MLT) and Inhalational or TIVA Anesthetic
- **Characteristics**:
  - MLTs are longer (30 cm) than conventional endotracheal tubes (ETTs)
  - Sizes range from 4.0 to 6.0 inner diameter (ID)
- **Advantages**:
  - Secure airway with airway protection
  - Ability to monitor airway pressures, FiO₂, and ETCO₂
  - Use of muscle relaxants provides good operating conditions with immobile vocal cords
- **Disadvantages**:
  - The posterior region of the larynx is obscured by the ETT
- **Anesthetic Options**:
  - Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) or inhalational anesthesia
  - Remifentanil infusion is helpful to blunt airway stimulation

### 2. Techniques with No Endotracheal Tube (ETT) and TIVA

#### a) Spontaneous Ventilation with Topicalization of Airway and Sedation
- **Advantages**:
  - Rapid mobilization and discharge
  - Less potential for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)
  - Avoidance of airway instrumentation
  - Increased likelihood of optimal voice outcome during vocal cord surgery
- **Topicalization**:
  - Adequate topicalization of the upper and lower airways takes 10-20 minutes
  - Achieved using 2% or 4% nebulized lignocaine
  - Additional gargling of local anesthesia without swallowing may be useful
- **Sedation**:
  - Conscious sedation with dexmedetomidine, midazolam, or ketamine, supplemented with titrations of remifentanil
  - Capnometry with nasal specs should be used when using remifentanil

#### b) Jet Ventilation (HFJV or LFJV) (Supraglottic, Infraglottic, or Transtracheal)
- **Low Frequency Jet Ventilation (LFJV)**:
  - 6-30 breaths per minute (bpm)
  - Oxygen applied by hand-triggered device (e.g., Sanders injector)
  - Oxygen from pipeline (400 kPa) passes through a pressure-reducing valve, regulated by a control near the handset to a pressure that produces desired chest-wall excursion
  - Gas exchange by convective ventilation or bulk flow
- **High Frequency Jet Ventilation (HFJV)**:
  - Tidal volumes smaller than dead space (1-2 ml/kg) at a frequency of 1-10 Hz
  - Time-cycled pressure-limited ventilation
  - Important mechanisms include laminar flow, Taylor type dispersion, pendelluft or collateral ventilation, and cardiogenic mixing
  - Requires specialized ventilator (e.g., Acutronic Mistral)

#### Supraglottic HFJV with TIVA
- Jet nozzle located above the vocal cords in the trachea
- Venturi effect: pressure drop as jet exits the catheter tip entrains ambient air through the laryngoscope
- Modified suspension laryngoscopes with a channel for the gas catheter
- Jet ventilation is not possible before the suspension laryngoscope is in place or after its removal
- Surgeon responsible for maintaining the airway
  - Malalignment can cause gastric distension
  - ETCO₂ cannot be measured with the supraglottic approach

![](Pasted%20image%2020240408120939.png)

#### Infraglottic LFJV, HFJV

- Jet nozzle located below the vocal cords in the trachea via a thin jet catheter positioned by laryngoscopy with the tip in the mid-trachea
- Laser-resistant double-lumen tubes:
	- LaserJet catheter (Acutronic MS) or Hunsaker Mon-Jet catheter
	- Allow for jet ventilation through one lumen and sampling of gases from the other or measurement of airway pressures
	- Hunsaker catheter is 33 cm long and ends in a basket-shaped plastic cage that aligns the jet in the middle of the airway
	- Prevents direct trauma to tracheal mucosa

![](Pasted%20image%2020240408120959.png)

#### Transtracheal LFJV, HFJV with TIVA

- Performed using a short, narrow (1 mm ID) catheter inserted via the cricothyroid space or the space between the cricoid cartilage and the first tracheal ring
- Purpose-made catheters include the Ravussin-type catheter
- Can be used to salvage failed intubation scenarios

#### Equipment Necessary for Jet Ventilation

- **High Frequency Jet Ventilators**:
	- Introduced in the 1970s
	- Acutronic Monsoon III ventilator:
		- Humidifies and warms gases at a frequency between 1-10 Hz
		- Driving pressure, frequency, inspiratory time, and composition of jet gas can be adjusted
		- FiO₂ can be altered but depends on the amount of air entrained
		- ETCO₂ requires temporary cessation of HFJV and normal tidal ventilation for measurement
	- Jet ventilation can cause increased airway pressure if gas egress is obstructed during expiration, especially in the case of tight airway stenosis
	- New ventilators display:
		- Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP)
		- Mean airway pressure
		- Plateau pressure (PP)
		- End expiratory pressure
		- Alarm limits can be set for PIP and PP
		- A high-pressure cut-off can be set to reduce complications
- **Jet Ventilation Catheters**:
	- Hunsaker Mon-Jet and LaserJet catheters:
		- Double lumen catheters
		- Made from non-flammable, fluoroplastic materials

### Complications of HFJV

#### Barotrauma

- Pneumothorax
- Pneumomediastinum
- Pneumoperitoneum
- Subcutaneous emphysema
- Air trapping can lead to decreased venous return, increased afterload for the right ventricle, resulting in decreased cardiac output and possible right ventricular failure

#### Exposure to Dry Gases Leading to

- Damage to the tracheobronchial mucosa:
	- Decreased mucociliary clearance, infection, airway plugging, atelectasis
	- Necrotizing tracheobronchitis
- Hypothermia

#### Malposition of Catheters (with Supraglottic Approach)

- Gastric distension or rupture

#### Inadequate Gas Exchange

- Hypercapnia
- Hypoxaemia

### Techniques Specifically Designed for Subglottic HFJV

#### c) Apnoeic Oxygenation with TIVA

- Recommended for the performance of pan-endoscopy
- Patients preoxygenated for 3 minutes with 100% oxygen, anesthetized with propofol and remifentanil, paralyzed with mivacurium, and hand-ventilated to an end-tidal oxygen (ETO₂) of >90%
- An 8 French catheter is introduced into the trachea using a laryngoscope, with the tip lying up to the carina, and oxygen flow of 500 ml/minute is administered through the catheter
- Technique relies on aventilatory mass flow

#### d) Intermittent Apnoea with TIVA or Inhalational Anaesthesia

- Relies on the MLT being removed intermittently for short periods (<5 minutes) to allow surgery to take place
- Patient under TIVA anesthesia
- MLT reinserted if SpO₂ falls below 90%
- Laryngospasm is a major complication
# Laser Surgery

## CO₂ Laser
- **CO₂ laser** is widely used in ENT surgery, particularly for soft tissue ablation in the treatment of laryngeal pathology.
  - It allows the application of a high amount of energy to a precise location, vaporizing cells.
  - **Advantages**:
	- Precision cutting
	- Minimal damage to nearby cells
	- Good haemostasis
  - **Disadvantages**:
	- Potential damage to healthy tissue if misdirected
	- Risk of airway or other fires if combustion occurs
- **Transmission**:
  - CO₂ laser radiation cannot be transmitted through fibreoptic cables and is transmitted via reflecting mirrors.

# Airway Fires

## Components Required for an Airway Fire
- **Fuel**: ETT, drapes, alcohol prep
- **Oxidizer**: O₂ or nitrous oxide
- **Ignition Source**: Laser, diathermy

## Reducing the Risk of Airway Fires
- Administer the lowest possible FiO₂ that maintains satisfactory O₂ saturation and avoid nitrous oxide as it supports combustion.
- For infraglottic jet ventilation, use a polytetrafluoroethylene catheter (LaserJet or Hunsaker Mon-Jet) as they are not flammable, though they can be punctured by CO₂ laser.
- When using a microlaryngeal tube (MLT):
  - Special precautions should be taken as both PVC tubes and red rubber tubes can ignite.
  - **Mallinckrodt™ Laser-Flex Tube**:
	- Has a flexometallic body with an external matte finish that defocuses laser beams
	- Double cuff design for additional safety
  - Use water instead of air to seal the cuff.
  - Add methylene blue to the cuff fluid to facilitate recognition of airway puncture.
  - If a laser-resistant ETT is not used, place wet pledgets around the PVC tube and keep them moist during surgery.
- Units using lasers should have a fire drill included in the WHO checklist.
- Keep a 50 ml syringe filled with saline available in case of an airway fire.

## Protocol for Airway Fire
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Remove the tracheal tube and have another team member extinguish it.
   - Remove pledgets and any ETT pieces left in the airway.
   - Pour saline or water into the airway to cool tissues.
2. **Care for the Patient**:
   - Reestablish the airway and resume ventilation with air until ensuring nothing is left smoldering in the airway, then switch to 100% oxygen.
   - Examine the airway to determine the extent of damage and treat accordingly.

## Prevention of Injury to Staff
- Wear protective eyewear as CO₂ laser is absorbed by glass and plastic, providing protection from eye damage.
- Place a warning notice on theatre doors when laser surgery is in progress.
- Wear masks if papillomata are to be resected.
- Use non-reflective instruments to prevent reflection.

# Postoperative Considerations Following Airway Surgery
- **Potential Problems**:
  - Airway obstruction
  - Bleeding
  - Laryngospasm
  - Laryngeal incompetence
- **Management**:
  - Administer dexamethasone or betamethasone intraoperatively to reduce oedema.
  - Nurse patients in a semi-sitting position and extubate either awake or under deep anesthesia.
  - Humidify oxygen, and in patients with stridor, administer nebulized adrenaline.
  - Consider administering heliox to reduce the work of breathing.
