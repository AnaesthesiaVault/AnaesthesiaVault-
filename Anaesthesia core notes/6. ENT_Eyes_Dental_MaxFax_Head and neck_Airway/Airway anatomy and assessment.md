# Neck Circumference to Inter-Incisor Gap Ratio: A New Predictor of Difficult Laryngoscopy in Cervical Spondylosis Patients

## Background

- Incidence of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation ranges from 1-15%.
- Patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis have impaired cervical mobility. The optimal laryngoscopy view is achieved when the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes are aligned, which is challenging in these patients.
  - Cervical spondylosis patients have a higher incidence of difficult laryngoscopy, leading to unexpected difficult airways and increased morbidity and mortality rates.

### Suggested Predictors for Difficult Laryngoscopy
- Increased neck circumference
- High score on the Mallampati Test (MMT)
- Small inter-incisor gap (IIG)
- Thyromental distance (TMD)
- These techniques are quick bedside tests, easy to perform without special equipment.
- None of these alone has high diagnostic accuracy, especially in cervical spondylosis patients.

### Improved Predictive Values
- Ratio of neck circumference to TMD (RNTMD)
  - When compared with other predictors like the Mallampati test and Wilson score in obese patients, the RNTMD had the best predictive outcome.
- IIG is a significant single predictor for difficult airways.
  - Reflects craniocervical extension, restricted in cervical spondylosis patients.
  - IIG could predict difficult airway better than TMD.

## Methods of Airway Assessment

### Cormack-Lehane Scale

| Classification | Description                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Class I        | Vocal cords completely visible     |
| Class II       | Only the arytenoids visible        |
| Class III      | Only the epiglottis visible        |
| Class IV       | The epiglottis not visible         |

### Modified Mallampati Test (MMT)

| Classification | Description                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class I        | Soft palate, fauces, uvula, and pillars visible         |
| Class II       | Soft palate, fauces, and uvula visible                  |
| Class III      | Soft palate and base of the uvula visible               |
| Class IV       | Soft palate not visible                                 |

- The IIG (distance between upper and lower incisors at the midline) was measured by asking each patient to open their mouth to the maximum extent.
- The TMD (distance from the thyroid notch to the mentum) was measured with the neck extended.
- Neck circumference at the level of the cricoid cartilage was measured.
- The RNIIG and RNTMD were then calculated.
- Oropharyngeal view was assessed using MMT classification.
  - Patients were asked to sit, open their mouth fully, and protrude their tongue without phonation.

## Discussion from Study Results

- Airway assessment includes taking a medical history, performing a physical examination, and reviewing clinical records.
- Bedside airway tests have been criticized for their poor predictive capability, related to the high incidence of unanticipated difficult airways.

- The study found a 16.4% incidence of difficult laryngoscopy in cervical spondylosis patients.
  - RNIIG was the only independent risk factor for difficult laryngoscopy.
  - RNIIG of ≥9.5 yielded moderate to high sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value.
  - Thus, a preoperative value of RNIIG ≥9.5 is a good predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in cervical spondylosis patients.

	- Comprises a body and greater and lesser horns/cornua

## Vocal Cords

- Made from the free upper edges of the cricothyroid membrane (conus elasticus) where it thickens to become the cricovocal ligament
- Covered with mucosa, pearly white, and has no submucosa; thus, it cannot become oedematous
- Posteriorly attached to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage, forming the posterior 40% of the cords
- The cricothyroid membrane is attached circumferentially around the inside of the ring of the cricoid cartilage
  - Has a free upper inner margin attached anteriorly to the back of the thyroid via Broyle’s ligament and posteriorly to the arytenoids
  - This free margin forms the vocal cords themselves
- The mucosa of the vocal cords consists of squamous epithelium, unlike the lining of the rest of the larynx, which is ciliated pseudostratified epithelium

## Muscles

- **Intrinsic Muscles**: Control the vocal cords
- **Extrinsic Muscles**: Further divided into
  - **Suprahyoid Muscles**: Stylohyoid, geniohyoid, mylohyoid, thyrohyoid, digastric, and stylopharyngeus
	- Elevate the larynx
  - **Infrahyoid Muscles**: Omohyoid, sternothyroid, sternohyoid, and thyrohyoid
	- Lower the larynx and alter the laryngeal shape to a minor degree
- All intrinsic muscles of the larynx are supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve except for the cricothyroid, which is supplied by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve
  - The cricothyroid is the only muscle that:
	- Tightens the vocal cords
	- Is supplied by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve
	- Is an intrinsic muscle of the larynx but lies outside the larynx

## Nerve Supply

- Nerves supplying the intrinsic muscles and sensation to the larynx originate from the vagus nerve, via the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves
- The superior laryngeal nerve separates from the vagus just outside the jugular foramen, at the inferior vagus ganglion
  - At the level of the hyoid, it subdivides into internal and external branches
	- **Internal Branch**: Passes through the thyrohyoid membrane, providing sensory innervation up to the vocal cords
	- **External Branch**: Supplies the cricothyroid muscle
- The recurrent laryngeal nerve branches from the vagus in the thorax, looping around the arch of the aorta on the left and the subclavian artery on the right before traveling back up between the oesophagus and the trachea
  - Supplies all intrinsic muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid and provides sensation to the larynx below the vocal cords
  - **Semon’s Law**: Describes the effects of different injuries to the recurrent laryngeal nerve due to the relative strength of the adductor muscles compared to the abductor muscles
	- **Complete Transection**: Causes complete paralysis, leaving the cords in a cadaveric position (half abducted and half adducted), preventing speech or coughing
	- **Trauma without Transection**: Results in partial paralysis, leaving the cords adducted due to the vulnerability of the posterior cricoarytenoid
	  - The subject cannot breathe
	- **Unilateral Damage**: The contralateral cord can partially compensate
	- **Bilateral Damage**: Life-threatening

  - Sympathetic nerves: Innervate blood vessels and smooth muscle
- **Relations**
  - **Anterior**: Inferior thyroid veins, anterior jugular arch, inferior mesenteric artery, thymus, sternum, sternohyoid, sternothyroid, left brachiocephalic veins
  - **Posterior**: Oesophagus, recurrent laryngeal nerves
  - **Lateral**: Carotid sheath, lateral lobes of the thyroid to the sixth ring
- **Cricothyrotomy and Tracheostomy**
  - **Cricothyrotomy**: Involves making a slit or small hole anteriorly in the relatively avascular cricothyroid membrane
  - **Tracheostomy**: Typically performed in the second or third tracheal ring by cutting a hole, often after dividing the thyroid isthmus if done surgically
	- The inferior thyroid veins and brachiocephalic vessels can obstruct the procedure and make it difficult

- **Left Main Bronchus**:
  - Characteristics: Narrower, longer, more horizontal
  - Length: 5 cm

### Clinical Points
- **Inhalation of Foreign Bodies**:
  - More likely to enter the right main bronchus due to its anatomical structure.
- **Double-Lumen Tracheal Tube Placement**:
  - More likely to be successfully placed if the bronchial part is inserted into the left main bronchus.

### Vascular Supply and Drainage
- **Arterial Supply**:
  - Bronchial arteries originating from the aorta.
- **Venous Drainage**:
  - **Right**: Azygos vein
  - **Left**: Hemiazygos vein
  - Additional drainage: Bronchial and pulmonary veins, contributing to physiological shunt.

### Nerve Supply
- **Autonomic Nerve Supply**:
  - Originates from the pulmonary plexus at the hilum.
- **Parasympathetic Supply**:
  - Effects: Vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, increased secretions, and responsible for sensation.
- **Sympathetic Supply**:
  - Effects: Vasoconstriction, bronchodilation via β2-receptors, and suppression of secretions via α-receptors.
# Preoperative Assessment of the Airway

## Introduction

### Definition
- **Varies in literature**:
  - According to the American Society of Anesthesiology's (ASA) Difficult Airway Guidelines, a difficult airway is one in which “a conventionally trained anesthesiologist experiences difficulty with facemask ventilation of the upper airway, difficulty with tracheal intubation, or both”.

### Clinical Importance
- The ASA Closed Claims database revealed that airway events account for 34% of all claims, with difficult intubation being the most common damaging event in anesthesia claims since the 1990s.
- A thorough review of the patient's medical history, comorbid conditions, and prior anesthetics is imperative for creating an airway-management plan.

### Predictors of Difficult Airway

#### Bedside Airway Assessment
- Conduct a targeted history and physical examination of patients.
  - Review anesthesia records; note any prior difficult airway as a risk factor.
  - Evaluate techniques used for previous airway management.
  - Pay attention to medical diagnoses, including laryngeal and mediastinal pathologies, as well as other diagnoses associated with difficult airway.

#### Disease States Associated with Difficult Airway Management

| Congenital                | Acquired                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Pierre–Robin syndrome     | Morbid obesity                                    |
| Treacher–Collins syndrome | Acromegaly                                        |
| Goldenhar's syndrome      | Infections involving the airway (Ludwig's Angina) |
| Mucopolysaccharidoses     | Rheumatoid arthritis                              |
| Achondroplasia            | Ankylosing spondylitis                            |
| Micrognathia              | Tumors involving the airway                       |
| Down's syndrome           | Trauma (airway, cervical spine)                   |

- Several specific tests have been recommended to help predict difficult intubation.

#### Predictors of Difficult Mask Ventilation

| Risk Factor                        |
| ---------------------------------- |
| Increased BMI                      |
| History of snoring/sleep apnea     |
| Lack of teeth                      |
| Age greater than 55 years          |
| Mallampati III or IV               |
| Limited mandibular protrusion test |
| Male gender                        |
| Airway masses/tumors               |

### Detailed Physical Examination

#### Overall Appearance
- Assess for physical signs of difficult mask ventilation and intubation.
  - Begin with a look at the patient's general appearance.
  - Note any abnormal head and neck appearance, including masses and evidence of trauma such as lacerations, fractures, and bleeding.
  - Presence of a cervical collar should be noted, as it may indicate possible difficulty.

#### Mouth Opening
- Evaluate the extent of mouth opening to:
  - Estimate ease of access to the larynx.
  - Assess mobility of the temporomandibular joint.
  - A mouth opening of ≤4 cm is a risk factor for difficult intubation.
  - Examination of the mouth allows for assessment of dentition.
	- Dentures or loose teeth may be at risk for dislodgement during intubation.
	- Prominent teeth may make placement of laryngoscope blades for direct laryngoscopy more challenging.

#### Mallampati Classification
- Examine the size of the tongue relative to the pharyngeal space.
  - This exam focuses on both mouth opening and visibility of the pharyngeal space.
  - In the original description by Dr. Mallampati, three classes were designated for visualization of the uvula, tonsillar pillars, and palate.
	- Samsoon and Young added a fourth class, linking higher Mallampati scores (III and IV) to higher (more difficult) Cormack-Lehane grades of laryngoscopy and difficult intubation.
  - Classifications:
	- **Class I**: Soft palate, uvula, fauces, and tonsillar pillars are visible.
	- **Class II**: Soft palate, uvula, and fauces are visible.
	- **Class III**: Soft palate and base of uvula are visible.
	- **Class IV**: Only the hard palate is visible.
  - A meta-analysis shows the modified Mallampati score has good discriminatory power for difficult direct laryngoscopy (ROC 0.89 ± 0.05) and intubation (0.83 ± 0.03) but poor power for predicting difficult ventilation.

#### Thyromental Distance
- Measure the distance between the chin and the thyroid cartilage (in finger breadths or cm).
  - This assesses mandibular space and compliance and predicts ease of tongue displacement during direct laryngoscopy.
  - Patients with micrognathia or retrognathia will have short thyromental distances.
  - Measurements <6 cm, especially coupled with higher Mallampati classes, are associated with higher odds of difficult intubation.

#### Neck Range of Motion
- Good neck mobility with normal flexion and extension allows manipulation of the neck and enhances view on direct laryngoscopy.
  - Assess the extent of neck mobility, evidence of prior neck surgery, and pain and/or neurologic symptoms upon movement.
  - A retrospective review of >14,000 patients identified decreased cervical spine motion as an independent risk factor for difficult mask ventilation, direct laryngoscopy, and intubation.

### Combining Prediction Assessments
- Physical exam findings alone have poor predictive values.
  - A meta-analysis by Shiga et al. confirmed that individual findings lack good discriminatory power, but prediction improves when findings are combined.
  - Wilson et al. developed a risk score using five risk factors (weight, head and neck movement, jaw movement, receding mandible, buck teeth) that had reasonable sensitivity but high false-positive values.
  - El-Ganzouri et al. identified seven risk factors for difficult intubation (mouth opening, thyromental distance, Mallampati class, neck movement, inability to extend the lower jaw, body weight, and history of difficult intubation) in over 10,000 patients.
  - Langeron et al. developed a comprehensive, computer-based prediction model in adult patients using variables such as Mallampati class, mouth opening, thyromental distance, body mass index, and presence of a receding mandible, predicting airway risk reasonably (ROC 0.86, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91, p < 0.001) with better accuracy than simplified scoring systems.

### Predictors of Difficult Mask Ventilation
- Defined as the inability to provide adequate ventilation due to one or more of the following:
  - Inadequate mask seal
  - Excessive gas leak
  - Excessive resistance to the ingress or egress of gas
- Langeron et al. identified five risk factors predictive of difficulty with mask ventilation:
  - Presence of at least two of the following: history of snoring, age >50, BMI ≥26, beard, and edentulous state predicted difficult mask ventilation with 72% sensitivity and 73% specificity.
  - Anatomical risk factors include Mallampati class III or IV, limited mandibular protrusion, male gender, and presence of an airway mass.

### Preoperative Airway Imaging

#### Perioperative Endoscopic Airway Evaluation
- Used for assessing the airway of patients with suspected or known airway pathology.
  - Determines the extent to which airway lesions, not easily identified on routine examination, will influence the airway management strategy.
  - In a cohort of 138 patients, the use of preoperative endoscopic airway evaluation (PEAE) as an adjunctive assessment caused anesthesiologists to change their airway strategy in 26% of cases.

#### Airway Ultrasound
- Used for airway assessment and confirmation of endotracheal tube placement.
  - Quick and non-invasive.
  - Visualizes multiple structures including the tongue, oropharynx, hypopharynx, hyoid bone, and epiglottis, even if not identifiable by palpation.
  - The larynx is better visualized on ultrasound than on CT or MRI due to its superficial nature.

# Preoperative Assessment of the Airway

## Introduction

### Definition
- **Varies in literature**:
  - According to the American Society of Anesthesiology's (ASA) Difficult Airway Guidelines, a difficult airway is one in which “a conventionally trained anesthesiologist experiences difficulty with facemask ventilation of the upper airway, difficulty with tracheal intubation, or both”.

### Clinical Importance
- The ASA Closed Claims database revealed that airway events account for 34% of all claims, with difficult intubation being the most common damaging event in anesthesia claims since the 1990s.
- A thorough review of the patient's medical history, comorbid conditions, and prior anesthetics is imperative for creating an airway-management plan.

### Predictors of Difficult Airway

#### Bedside Airway Assessment
- Conduct a targeted history and physical examination of patients.
  - Review anesthesia records; note any prior difficult airway as a risk factor.
  - Evaluate techniques used for previous airway management.
  - Pay attention to medical diagnoses, including laryngeal and mediastinal pathologies, as well as other diagnoses associated with difficult airway.

#### Disease States Associated with Difficult Airway Management

| Congenital                | Acquired                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Pierre–Robin syndrome     | Morbid obesity                                    |
| Treacher–Collins syndrome | Acromegaly                                        |
| Goldenhar's syndrome      | Infections involving the airway (Ludwig's Angina) |
| Mucopolysaccharidoses     | Rheumatoid arthritis                              |
| Achondroplasia            | Ankylosing spondylitis                            |
| Micrognathia              | Tumors involving the airway                       |
| Down's syndrome           | Trauma (airway, cervical spine)                   |

- Several specific tests have been recommended to help predict difficult intubation.

#### Predictors of Difficult Mask Ventilation

| Risk Factor                        |
| ---------------------------------- |
| Increased BMI                      |
| History of snoring/sleep apnea     |
| Lack of teeth                      |
| Age greater than 55 years          |
| Mallampati III or IV               |
| Limited mandibular protrusion test |
| Male gender                        |
| Airway masses/tumors               |

### Detailed Physical Examination

#### Overall Appearance
- Assess for physical signs of difficult mask ventilation and intubation.
  - Begin with a look at the patient's general appearance.
  - Note any abnormal head and neck appearance, including masses and evidence of trauma such as lacerations, fractures, and bleeding.
  - Presence of a cervical collar should be noted, as it may indicate possible difficulty.

#### Mouth Opening
- Evaluate the extent of mouth opening to:
  - Estimate ease of access to the larynx.
  - Assess mobility of the temporomandibular joint.
  - A mouth opening of ≤4 cm is a risk factor for difficult intubation.
  - Examination of the mouth allows for assessment of dentition.
	- Dentures or loose teeth may be at risk for dislodgement during intubation.
	- Prominent teeth may make placement of laryngoscope blades for direct laryngoscopy more challenging.

#### Mallampati Classification
- Examine the size of the tongue relative to the pharyngeal space.
  - This exam focuses on both mouth opening and visibility of the pharyngeal space.
  - In the original description by Dr. Mallampati, three classes were designated for visualization of the uvula, tonsillar pillars, and palate.
	- Samsoon and Young added a fourth class, linking higher Mallampati scores (III and IV) to higher (more difficult) Cormack-Lehane grades of laryngoscopy and difficult intubation.
  - Classifications:
	- **Class I**: Soft palate, uvula, fauces, and tonsillar pillars are visible.
	- **Class II**: Soft palate, uvula, and fauces are visible.
	- **Class III**: Soft palate and base of uvula are visible.
	- **Class IV**: Only the hard palate is visible.
  - A meta-analysis shows the modified Mallampati score has good discriminatory power for difficult direct laryngoscopy (ROC 0.89 ± 0.05) and intubation (0.83 ± 0.03) but poor power for predicting difficult ventilation.

#### Thyromental Distance
- Measure the distance between the chin and the thyroid cartilage (in finger breadths or cm).
  - This assesses mandibular space and compliance and predicts ease of tongue displacement during direct laryngoscopy.
  - Patients with micrognathia or retrognathia will have short thyromental distances.
  - Measurements <6 cm, especially coupled with higher Mallampati classes, are associated with higher odds of difficult intubation.

#### Neck Range of Motion
- Good neck mobility with normal flexion and extension allows manipulation of the neck and enhances view on direct laryngoscopy.
  - Assess the extent of neck mobility, evidence of prior neck surgery, and pain and/or neurologic symptoms upon movement.
  - A retrospective review of >14,000 patients identified decreased cervical spine motion as an independent risk factor for difficult mask ventilation, direct laryngoscopy, and intubation.

### Combining Prediction Assessments
- Physical exam findings alone have poor predictive values.
  - A meta-analysis by Shiga et al. confirmed that individual findings lack good discriminatory power, but prediction improves when findings are combined.
  - Wilson et al. developed a risk score using five risk factors (weight, head and neck movement, jaw movement, receding mandible, buck teeth) that had reasonable sensitivity but high false-positive values.
  - El-Ganzouri et al. identified seven risk factors for difficult intubation (mouth opening, thyromental distance, Mallampati class, neck movement, inability to extend the lower jaw, body weight, and history of difficult intubation) in over 10,000 patients.

### Predictors of Difficult Mask Ventilation
- Defined as the inability to provide adequate ventilation due to one or more of the following:
  - Inadequate mask seal
  - Excessive gas leak
  - Excessive resistance to the ingress or egress of gas
- Langeron et al. identified five risk factors predictive of difficulty with mask ventilation:

  - Anatomical risk factors include Mallampati class III or IV, limited mandibular protrusion, male gender, and presence of an airway mass.

### Preoperative Airway Imaging

#### Perioperative Endoscopic Airway Evaluation
- Used for assessing the airway of patients with suspected or known airway pathology.
  - Determines the extent to which airway lesions, not easily identified on routine examination, will influence the airway management strategy.
  - In a cohort of 138 patients, the use of preoperative endoscopic airway evaluation (PEAE) as an adjunctive assessment caused anesthesiologists to change their airway strategy in 26% of cases.

#### Airway Ultrasound
- Used for airway assessment and confirmation of endotracheal tube placement.
  - Quick and non-invasive.
  - Visualizes multiple structures including the tongue, oropharynx, hypopharynx, hyoid bone, and epiglottis, even if not identifiable by palpation.
  - The larynx is better visualized on ultrasound than on CT or MRI due to its superficial nature.
- Preoperative ultrasound can be used to:
  - Identify airway pathology.
  - Identify landmarks for the performance of airway blocks.
  - Identify the location of the cricothyroid membrane prior to airway management in patients with suspected airway difficulty.
- A small study of obese patients compared ultrasonographic measurements of hyomental distance with the head in neutral versus hyperextended positions:
  - Suggested that hyomental distance ratios of <1.1 were more predictive of a difficult airway than those >1.1.
- Ezri et al. predicted difficult laryngoscopy using pretracheal soft tissue measurements in obese patients:
  - The distance from the skin to the trachea, measured at the level of the vocal cords, was greater in obese patients with difficult laryngoscopy.

#### Other Imaging Modalities
- Cervical spine X-ray to look for:
  - Cervical spine fractures
  - Significant spondylosis
  - Inflammatory arthropathies
- CT scan or MRI of the neck to look for pathology that may distort normal airway anatomy:
  - Thyroid masses
  - Vascular rings
  - Congenital stenosis
  - Tracheomalacia

### Special Patient Populations

#### The Obese Patient
- **Definition by WHO**: BMI >30 kg/m².
- Characteristics:
  - Low residual volumes and decreased functional residual capacity.
  - Low respiratory reserves to meet the demands of their increased minute ventilation.
- Evidence suggests that obese patients have an increased incidence of difficult airway management, although this is debated.
  - Langeron et al. found high BMI (>26 kg/m²) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), common in obese patients, to be risk factors for difficult mask ventilation.
  - 30% of those patients were also difficult to intubate

.

- On the validated Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), difficulty with intubation is defined as a score ≥5.
  - Although the literature is equivocal, the presence of obesity along with other findings, such as higher Mallampati scores and OSA, should raise concern for potential difficult airway.
  - Patients with central obesity (higher fat distribution around abdominal and visceral organs) are at higher risk for OSA, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality than patients with peripheral obesity.
  - Patients can be screened for OSA with the STOP BANG questionnaire.
	- A validated tool with high sensitivity and specificity.
	- Chung et al. reported that a score of 3 on the STOP BANG questionnaire can predict OSA with sensitivities of 93% and 100% for moderate and severe OSA, respectively.
- Additional preparation before airway management:
  - **Positioning**:
	- Ramped position (head and shoulders elevated, bringing the external auditory meatus to the same level as the sternum) will facilitate intubation and improve preoxygenation.
  - Additional time for preoxygenation.

#### STOP BANG Assessment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea
- **Snoring**: Do you snore loudly (loud enough to be heard through closed doors)?
- **Tired**: Do you often feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during daytime?
- **Observed**: Has anyone observed you stop breathing during your sleep?
- **Blood Pressure**: Do you have or are you being treated for high blood pressure?
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index >35 kg/m²?
- **Age**: Age over 50 years old?
- **Neck circumference**: Neck circumference >40 cm?
- **Gender**: Male?
  - ≥3 factors are associated with a high likelihood of obstructive sleep apnea.

#### The Pregnant Patient
- Pregnant women are at eight times higher risk of having a difficult airway than patients in the average surgical population.
  - Difficult intubation and esophageal intubation have been reported as leading causes of anesthesia-related obstetric complications.
- Considerations:
  - Pregnant patients are considered to have “full stomachs,” and most general anesthetics in obstetrics are emergent in nature.
  - Factors influencing airway management:
	- Increased airway edema.
	- Larger breasts.
	- Increased oxygen consumption.
	- Decreased functional residual capacity.
  - The Mallampati class has been described to have good predictability during pregnancy.
  - Preparing for obstetric airway:
	- Adequate and functional equipment.
	- Multiple backup airway device options available as alternatives.
	- Additional providers to assist in rapidly and safely securing the airway.
	- Positioning the patient into a sniffing position improves the alignment of the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes and thus visualization of the airway.
	- Ramping position can also be beneficial.
![](Pasted%20image%2020240408134718.png)
·       #### The Trauma Patient

- **Challenges**:
	- Emergent nature of the procedure.
	- Presence of a full stomach.
	- Possibility of active oropharyngeal bleeding.
	- Difficulty in airway assessment due to:
		- Depressed level of consciousness.
		- Intoxication.
		- Combative state.
	- Many trauma patients are assumed to have unstable cervical spines prior to radiologic assessment and present in a cervical collar.
- **LEMON Airway Assessment**:
	- Recommended as a tool to assess trauma patients.
	- Quick and simple to use.
	- A study by Reed et al. demonstrated that this tool can successfully stratify patients at high risk for difficult intubation in the emergency department.
	- Patients with a LEMON score of 3 or higher had a higher incidence of difficult intubation.
	- Presence of large incisors, a reduced inter-incisor distance, and a reduced thyroid-to-floor-of-mouth distance were correlated with difficulty (p < 0.005).

|Assessment|Description|
|---|---|
|Look|Examine for gross abnormalities or lesions, trauma, large tongue|
|Evaluate 3–3–2 rule|- Inter-incisor distance (<3 finger breaths)|
||- Hyoid-mental distance (<3 finger breaths)|
||- Thyroid-floor-of-the-mouth distance (<2 finger breaths)|
|Mouth opening|Assess Mallampati class (>3)|
|Obstruction|Conditions that can cause obstructions such as epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscesses|
|Neck mobility|Presence of hard collar, inability to extend neck|

#### The Critically Ill Patient

- The incidence of difficult intubation is higher in patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) than in other settings.
	- Rates as high as 23% among ICU patients, compared to about 14% in the general surgical patient population.
	- Poor physiologic reserve: airway events are poorly tolerated by these patients and associated with very high complication rates.
	- The Fourth National Audit Project (NAP4) by the Difficult Airway Society found a significantly higher incidence of airway-related complications in ICU patients.
	- The NAP4 study also found that inadequate equipment, lack of capnography, and delayed recognition of high-risk patients were associated with airway-related adverse events.
- Patients often have depressed mental status and cannot follow commands for an airway examination.
- Need to secure the airway is often urgent.
- De Jong et al. identified the MACOCHA score from a prospective multicenter study of 1000 consecutive intubations in 42 ICUs.
	- **MACOCHA Scores for Predicting Difficult Airway in Critically Ill Patients**:

|Variable|Score|
|---|---|
|Mallampati class III or IV|5|
|Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome|2|
|Reduced mobility of the cervical spine|1|
|Limited mouth opening (<3 cm)|1|
|Presence of coma (Glasgow coma scale <8)|1|
|Severe hypoxia (<80% oxygen saturation)|1|
|Non-anesthesiologist operator|1|

- Scores of ≥3 predicted difficult airway with good sensitivity and specificity.
- The MACOCHA score uses seven simple variables that discriminate well between difficult and non-difficult intubations in the ICU.
	- Sensitivity was 73%, and specificity was 89%.
	- The negative predictive value was 98%, but the positive predictive value was lower at 36%, attributed to the low incidence of difficult intubation (8%) in the validation cohort.
	- This tool uses factors related to severity of illness, including the degree of hypoxemia, which decreases time to oxygen desaturation, and the presence of coma, which can result in increased secretions and poor visualization.
- Emphasis should be on optimizing the intubating environment as much as possible, with capnography, alternate airway equipment, and additional provider support immediately available.
