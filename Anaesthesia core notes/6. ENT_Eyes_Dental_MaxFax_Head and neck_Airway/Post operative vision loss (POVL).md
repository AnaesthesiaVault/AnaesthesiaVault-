# Postoperative Vision Loss

## General
- **Incidence:**
  - 0.028 to 0.2%
  - Common in spine, cardiac, and head-neck surgeries
- **Causes:**
  - External ocular injury (corneal abrasion or sclera injury)
  - Cortical blindness
  - Retinal ischemia
  - Ischemic optic neuropathy (ION), particularly posterior ION (PION), often associated with lumbar operations (Lumbar ION or LION)
  - Acute glaucoma

## Causes
### External Ocular Injury
- **Corneal Trauma:**
  - Can result in irritation, abrasion, or laceration
  - May be self-limiting or increase the risk of ocular inflammation and infection
  - Patients present with pain and a foreign body sensation in the eye

### Cortical Blindness
- **Symptoms:**
  - Accompanied by signs of stroke in the parieto-occipital region (agnosia, inability to interpret sensory stimuli)
  - Pupillary reflexes are preserved
  - Most of the visual field is restored within days

### Retinal Ischemia
- **Types:**
  - Branch and central retinal artery occlusion
  - Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO): decreases blood supply to the entire retina
  - Retinal arterial branch occlusion (BRAO): affects a portion of the retina
- **Characteristics:**
  - Unilateral injury
- **Causes:**
  - External compression of the eye
  - Decreased blood supply to the retina (embolism or systemic causes)
  - Impaired venous drainage of the retina
  - Retinal arterial thrombosis due to coagulation disorders
- **Risk Factors:**
  - Altered facial anatomy, osteogenesis imperfecta, exophthalmos, lower nasal bridges (common in patients of Asian descent)
  - External compression can cause sufficient intraocular pressure (IOP) to stop flow in the central retinal artery
- **Symptoms:**
  - Painless visual loss, abnormal pupil reactivity, unilateral vision loss, loss of light perception, afferent pupil defect, periorbital/eyelid edema, chemosis, proptosis, ptosis, supraorbital region paresthesias, hazy/cloudy cornea, corneal abrasion
- **Treatment:**
  - Ocular massage to lower IOP and dislodge an embolus (contraindicated if glaucoma cannot be ruled out)
  - Intravenous acetazolamide, 5% CO2 in oxygen inhalation

### Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (ION)
- **Characteristics:**
  - Common in adults
  - Two types: anterior (AION) and posterior (PION)
  - Arteritic (inflammatory, e.g., giant cell arteritis) or non-arteritic (occlusive, more common)
- **Causes:**
  - Hypotension, blood loss, anemia, hemodilution, altered venous hemodynamics, abnormal autoregulation, small cup-to-disc ratio, vasopressor use
- **Risk Factors:**
  - Hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity, prone positioning, lengthy spinal surgery, sleep-apnea syndrome, hypercoagulability
- **Mechanism:**
  - Elevated venous pressure in the head damages the optic nerve via mechanical compression, venous infarction, or compression of pial vessels
  - Wilson frame increases venous pressure by placing the head lower than the heart
  - Greater blood loss and inflammation favor interstitial edema formation
- **Treatment:**
  - **Prevention:**
	- Position heads of high-risk patients level with or higher than the heart, maintain neutral forward head position
	- Consider staged procedures for high-risk patients
  - **Management:**
	- No definitive treatment
	- Acetazolamide, diuretics like mannitol or furosemide to reduce IOP and edema
	- Correction of hypotension and anemia
	- Head-up position if increased ocular venous pressure is suspected
	- Immediate decompression (lateral canthotomy) for ocular compartment syndrome

### Acute Glaucoma
- **Symptoms:**
  - Painful red eye, cloudy/blurred vision, headache, nausea, vomiting, bilateral involvement
- **Treatment:**
  - β-adrenergic antagonists, α-adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, cholinergic agonists, corticosteroids

## Prevention
- **Corneal Injuries:**
  - Apply lubricants and tape eyes shut before positioning
- **Cortical Damage:**
  - Reduce chances of embolization
- **CRAO Prevention:**
  - Avoid globe compression (mask, surgeon's arm)
  - Use foam headrests with proper eye placement, check head and eye position intermittently (every 20 minutes)
  - Use horseshoe headrests cautiously

## Specific Preventative Strategies
- **Identification:** Identify and communicate risk to team members
- **Padding and Positioning:**
  - No pressure on eyes, regular eye checks, tape eyes shut
  - Head and neck in neutral position, head at or above heart level
  - Avoid compression of venous drainage
- **Surgical Time Minimization:** Consider staged surgery if >6 hours or high blood loss expected
- **Emboli Avoidance:** De-air heart, use microfilters on bypass circuit
- **Hypotension and Anemia:** Avoid deliberate hypotensive techniques, maintain hemoglobin >9.4 g/dL and hematocrit >28%, use colloids and crystalloids to maintain intravascular volume, avoid prolonged vasopressor use

## Treatment
- Inspect eyes for signs of injury/pressure
- Check pupillary response and visual fields
- Immediate referral to ophthalmology
- Supportive measures:
  - Correct hemoglobin and hematocrit
  - Treat hypotension
	
# Summary Recommendations of the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Perioperative Blindness

## High-Risk Patients
- **Prolonged Spine Procedures:**
  - Patients undergoing prolonged spine procedures in the prone position under general anesthesia with substantial blood loss have an increased risk for the development of perioperative visual loss.
- **Risk Communication:**
  - It is preferable to inform high-risk patients that there is a small, unpredictable risk of perioperative visual loss.

## Intraoperative Management
- **Hypotensive Techniques:**
  - Deliberate hypotensive techniques during spine surgery have not been shown to be associated with the development of perioperative visual loss.
- **Colloid Use:**
  - Colloids should be used early along with crystalloids to maintain intravascular volume in patients with substantial blood loss.
- **Hematocrit Threshold:**
  - There is no recommended hematocrit threshold that would eliminate the risk of perioperative visual loss related to anemia.

## Positioning
- **Head Position:**
  - High-risk patients should be positioned with the head level higher than the heart when possible. Additionally, the head should be maintained in a neutral forward position, avoiding significant neck flexion, extension, lateral flexion, or rotation, when possible.

## Procedure Planning
- **Staged Procedures:**
  - High-risk patients should be considered for staged procedures, whenever possible.
