# Technique
## Neuraxial Ultrasound Approach: Systematic Approach to Ultrasound-Guided Neuraxial Block by a Midline Approach

### 1. Patient Position and Equipment
- **Patient Position**: Position the patient in either sitting or lateral position with forward flexion of the lumbar spine.
- **Anatomical Landmarks**: Identify the midline and lumbar spine by palpation of standard anatomical landmarks.
- **Ultrasound Equipment**: Use a low-frequency (2–5 MHz), curved-array probe.

### 2. Parasagittal Transverse Process View
- **Probe Placement**: Place the probe in a sagittal orientation, approximately 3–4 cm lateral from the midline on the lumbar spine, slightly cephalad to the sacrum.
- **Objective**: Identify the finger-like acoustic shadows of the transverse processes.
- **Key Ultrasonographic Structures**:
  - Erector spinae muscle
  - Psoas muscle
  - Transverse processes

### 3. Parasagittal Articular Process View
- **Probe Adjustment**: Slide the probe medially while maintaining a strictly parasagittal orientation.
- **Objective**: Observe the transition from the discontinuous pattern of the transverse process view to the continuous, hyperechoic line formed by the articular processes.
- **Key Ultrasonographic Structures**:
  - Erector spinae muscle
  - Articular processes

### 4. Parasagittal Oblique (Interlaminar) View (PSO View)
- **Probe Adjustment**: From the parasagittal articular process view, tilt the probe obliquely to direct the ultrasound beam more medially into the vertebral canal.
- **Objective**: Observe the transition from the rounded ‘humps’ of the articular processes to the sawtooth-like acoustic shadows of the laminae, with the hyperechoic posterior and anterior complexes visible in between.
- **Key Ultrasonographic Structures**:
  - Laminae
  - Posterior complex
  - Intrathecal space
  - Anterior complex

### 5. Identify and Mark Appropriate Intervertebral Spaces Using the PSO View
- **Probe Adjustment**: In the PSO view, slide the probe caudad until the sacrum is identified as a long horizontal hyperechoic line.
- **Objective**: Identify the L5–S1 interspace and mark each interspace on the ultrasound screen.
- **Skin Marking**: Make a corresponding skin mark at the midpoint of the long edge of the probe to indicate the intervertebral space location.

### 6. Transverse Interlaminar/Interspinous View (TI View)
- **Probe Orientation**: Turn the probe 90° into a transverse orientation and slide cephalad or caudad to obtain the TI view into a chosen lumbar interspace.
- **Objective**: Identify the anterior complex as the most important ultrasonographic landmark; the posterior complex is often only faintly visible.
- **Improvement Technique**: Cephalad tilt of the probe may improve the quality of the view, especially where spaces are narrow.
- **Key Ultrasonographic Structures**:
  - Anterior complex
  - Posterior complex
  - Midline interspinous ligament
  - Articular processes
  - Transverse processes

### 7. Identify and Mark Needle Insertion for a Midline Approach Using the TI View
- **Ultrasound Imaging**: Centre the neuraxial midline on the screen.
- **Skin Marking**:
  - Midpoint of the probe’s long edge (neuraxial midline).
  - Midpoint of the probe’s short edge (interspinous/interlaminar space).
  - Intersection of these two marks indicates the needle insertion point.
- **Needle Insertion Depth**: Estimate by measuring the distance from skin to the deep aspect of the posterior complex.
- **Alternative Approach**: If the TI view is unsatisfactory, determine the interlaminar space location from the PSO view and mark accordingly.

### 8. Needle Insertion
- **Insertion Site**: Insert the needle at the marked site in the midline.
- **Angle Maintenance**: Maintain the same cephalad angle used to obtain the optimal TI view.
- **Guidance**: Needle insertion and redirection should be guided by tactile feedback (e.g., contact with bone, feel of the ligamentum flavum, loss of resistance).
- **Redirection Precautions**: Avoid large redirections and ensure there is no deflection from the intended trajectory, especially with smaller-gauge spinal needles.
## Alternative Skin Marking and Needle Insertion for a Paramedian Approach

### Indication for Paramedian Approach
- **Indication**: Required in patients with narrowed interspinous spaces for successful entry into the epidural/intrathecal space.
- **Alternative Use**: Utilized when a satisfactory transverse interlaminar/interspinous (TI) view cannot be obtained.

### Technique Description
- **Ultrasound View**: Utilize the transverse spinous process view to identify the neuraxial midline and the spinous processes bordering the targeted intervertebral space.
- **Ultrasound Imaging**:
  - Center the spinous process shadow in the middle of the ultrasound screen.
  - **Skin Marking**:
	- Midpoint of the long edge of the probe (neuraxial midline).
	- Midpoint of the short edge of the probe (spinous process in the transverse plane).
  - Repeat for at least two adjacent spinous processes.

### Needle Insertion Point
- **Initial Marking**:
  - Mark the initial needle insertion point 1 cm lateral to the midline.
  - Mark 1 cm superior to the line indicating the lower spinous process.

### Needle Insertion Technique
- **Needle Angle**: Insert the needle with a slight medial and cephalad angulation (5°–10°) alongside the spinous process.
- **Tactile Feedback**: Use tactile feedback (e.g., contact with the bony lamina) to indicate the need for incremental needle redirection, usually in a cephalad direction.
- **Technique Consistency**: Perform this in a similar manner to the conventional landmark-based technique of neuraxial block, based on a sound understanding of vertebral anatomy.

# Ultrasound for Lumbar Spinal and Epidural Anaesthesia: Current Evidence

## Accurate Identification of Specific Intervertebral Levels

- **Evidence**: Neuraxial ultrasound can identify vertebral levels more accurately than palpation of surface anatomical landmarks.
- **Systematic Review Findings**: Poor correlation between levels determined by ultrasound and palpation (agreement rates: 14% to 64%). Levels identified by palpation were often higher than those identified by ultrasound.
- **Additional Imaging Techniques**: Plain radiographs, CT, and MRI confirm ultrasound's accuracy, with discrepancies of one space above or below the true level compared to two or three levels with palpation.
- **Accuracy Rates**: Older studies showed ultrasound correctly identified vertebral levels 68-76% of the time. More recent studies indicate >90% accuracy with adequate repetition.

## Measurement of Depth to the Intrathecal or Epidural Space

- **Correlation**: Excellent correlation between ultrasound-measured depth and actual needle insertion depth (difference ∼5 mm).
- **Sources of Error**: Tissue compression by the ultrasound probe, accuracy of electronic calipers placement, minor technological inaccuracies, and differences in beam and needle trajectory.
- **View Techniques**: Effective using transverse, sagittal, or PSO views.

## Improvement in Clinical Efficacy of Neuraxial Block

- **RCT Data**: Improved clinical efficacy of obstetric epidural analgesia with ultrasound guidance compared to surface-landmark techniques.
	- **Largest Study**: Involving 300 obstetric patients, lower rates of incomplete analgesia (2% vs 8%) and lower post-block pain scores were reported.
	- **Vallejo et al.**: Study of 370 labor epidurals performed by first-year anaesthesia trainees showed a lower failure rate with ultrasound guidance (1.6% vs 5.5%, P<0.02).
- **Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses**:
	- **Shaikh et al.**: Observed a 79% reduction in overall procedure failure rate with ultrasound guidance.
	- **Perlas et al.**: Confirmed a 49% reduction in procedural failure, evaluating 14 RCTs involving 1768 patients, including those with obesity, scoliosis, or previous spinal surgery.

## Improvement in Technical Performance of Neuraxial Block

- **Meta-Analysis Findings**: Neuraxial ultrasound improves the technical performance of CNB by reducing multiple needle passes, which decreases tissue trauma and complication risk.
	- **Shaikh et al.**: Found significant reduction in skin punctures and needle redirection attempts.
	- **Perlas et al.**: Noted reduction in overall needle passes (mean difference 0.75).
- **Challenges with Anatomical Landmarks**: Ultrasound benefits in cases with abnormal or poorly palpable landmarks.
	- **Chin et al.**: Study of 120 orthopaedic patients (obesity, lumbar scoliosis, previous lumbar surgery) showed increased first-attempt success rates, reduced median needle insertions, and fewer additional needle passes with pre-procedural ultrasound.
	- **Obese Patients**: Subgroup analyses showed >50% reduction in needle insertion attempts and passes with ultrasound guidance.
	- **Shaikh et al.**: Found more marked decrease in needle redirections in patients with predicted technical difficulty (mean difference 3.65 vs 0.99 passes).
