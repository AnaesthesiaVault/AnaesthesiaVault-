# Recommendation for Use

## ASA Guidelines Recommendation 1 (Benefit Outweighs Risk)
- Confirm and refine preoperative diagnosis.
- Detect new or unsuspected pathology (e.g., clot).
- Adjust anaesthetic and surgical plan accordingly.
- Assess the results of surgical intervention.

## Tidbits

- The term "inferior wall of the LV" refers to the heart's orientation, as it sits forward and faces inferiorly rather than posteriorly.
- Use M-Mode to measure cardiac function only if there is no regional wall abnormality.
- The short-axis view differs in transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) compared to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). In TOE, the superior wall corresponds to the inferior wall in TTE, and the superior wall in TTE corresponds to the anterior wall in TOE, due to the probe's location relative to the heart.
- Stroke volume (SV) measurement: calculated using the continuity equation, SV = LVOT x VTI
- Mitral valve (MV) appearance:
  - MV frown: viewed from below.
  - MV smile: viewed from the top.

- **Left-handed:** Hold the probe in the left hand, positioned on the left hip.

## Movements

- **Turn Right and Left:** Rotate the probe to the right and left.
- **Advance and Retract:** Move the probe forward and backward.
- **Rotate (Degrees):** Use the small roller on the side to rotate towards and away from the patient.

3. Degrees and axis

## Oesophageal

### Mid-Oesophagus
- 30 cm depth

#### ME 4-Chamber (ME 4ch)
- Landmark view (home base)
![[Pasted image 20230513090032.png]]
- **Depth:** 30 cm
- **Retroflex:** 0-10 degrees

##### Observations

- **Orientation:** Septal to lateral

# Doppler Interpretation
## Corrected (Systolic) Flow Time (FTc)

- **Indicates:** Preload
- **Normal Range:** 0.33-0.36 seconds
- **Interpretation:** FTc and peak velocity (PV) indicate afterload

## Peak Velocity (PV)

- **Indicates:** Contractility
- **Normal Range:** Age-related
	- 20 years: 90-120 cm/sec
	- 90 years: 30-60 cm/sec
- **Interpretation:** FTc and PV indicate afterload

## Summary of Velocity-Time Graph

### Key Points

- **Markers of Contractility:**
	- **Velocity**
	- **Peak Velocity**
	- **Mean Acceleration**
- **Stroke Distance:** Marker of stroke volume

## Actions from Readings (Interpreted in Clinical Context)

- **Low SV (Stroke Volume):** Administer fluids
- **Low FTc (Flow Time Corrected):** Administer fluids
- **Low PV (Peak Velocity):** Administer inotropes
- **Low PV + Low FTc:** Decrease afterload

# Approach in Cardiac Surgery
## Intraoperative Use of TEE

Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is commonly utilized for:

- Confirming and characterizing cardiac valve pathology prior to cardiac valve procedures.
- Monitoring air removal after open cardiotomy.
- Assessing the adequacy of repaired or replaced valves [1-3].

Observational data indicate that intraoperative TEE during cardiac valve surgery may improve outcomes. A matched cohort study from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database involving 872,936 patients undergoing open cardiac valve and/or proximal aortic surgery found intraoperative TEE associated with:

- Lower 30-day mortality (3.81% vs. 5.27%; OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.72).
- Lower composite outcomes of stroke or 30-day mortality (5.56% vs. 7.01%; OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.74-0.79).
- Lower reoperation or 30-day mortality (7.18% vs. 8.87%; OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.76-0.80).

These findings suggest significant clinical benefits of intraoperative TEE for patients undergoing cardiac valve and/or proximal aortic surgery.

## Preoperative Evaluation

Preoperative evaluation using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and TEE includes assessment of:

- Valve structure and function.
- Associated lesions.
- Hemodynamics.
- Ventricular function.

## Precautions and Contraindications

Precautions and contraindications for TEE use are similar to those for noncardiac surgical procedures. Detailed information can be found in related sections on noncardiac surgery TEE [5].

## Intraoperative TEE Procedures

### Prebypass Period

- **Initial Assessment:** TEE examination after initial probe insertion confirms preoperative diagnoses and refines the operative plan (e.g., valve repair vs. replacement) [5].
- **Hemodynamic Changes:** Intraoperative assessments may differ from preoperative due to hemodynamic changes during general anesthesia induction. For instance, reduced systemic BP can decrease the severity of aortic regurgitation (AR) and/or mitral regurgitation (MR), while reduced cardiac output decreases gradients across stenotic valves [6,7].

### AR and Cardioplegia

Significant AR limits the delivery of adequate antegrade cardioplegia solution into the coronary artery ostia post cross-clamping, causing:

- Failure to achieve cardioplegia.
- LV distention.

Management includes alternative methods for cardioplegia delivery (e.g., retrograde cardioplegia) and LV vent insertion to maintain LV decompression. Significant AR is also a relative contraindication for intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) placement due to increased regurgitation risk during diastolic balloon inflation.

### Comprehensive TEE Examination

- **Assessment of Pathology:** Identifies other pathologies such as patent foramen ovale and assesses global and regional ventricular function.
- **Inotropic Support:** Required for patients with significant LV or RV systolic dysfunction.

### Removal of Air Post-Open Cardiotomy

Air accumulates in the left heart chambers during valve repair/replacement. TEE helps identify and monitor air removal to prevent embolization to coronary, cerebral, and other vital organ arteries. Techniques include:

- **Venting:** Via surgical vents in the aortic root and LV.
- **Positioning:** Trendelenburg position to decrease cerebral embolization risk.

### Postbypass Period

- **Valve Function Assessment:** TEE assesses the function of repaired/replaced valves and identifies complications like myocardial ischemia.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** After weaning from CPB, TEE monitors LV and RV function and intravascular volume status.
- **Aortic Evaluation:** Post-aortic decannulation evaluation to exclude aortic dissection.
