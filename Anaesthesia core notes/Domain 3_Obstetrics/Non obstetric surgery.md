## Anaesthetic Concerns in Maternal Care

### Maternal Safety

- Physiological changes of pregnancy
- Conditions compelling surgery during pregnancy

### Foetal Safety

- Placental transfer of drugs
- Issues of teratogenicity:
	- Timing of exposure
	- Duration/dosage of exposure
	- FDA pregnancy category
	- Individual anaesthetic drugs
- Maternal factors leading to fetal compromise:
	- Maternal hypoxia
	- Maternal hyper/hypocarbia
	- Changes in uterine blood flow

### Goals and Conflicts

- Delay non-elective surgery to the second trimester if possible
- Optimize and maintain normal maternal physiological function
- Optimize and maintain uteroplacental blood flow and oxygen delivery (guided by FHR monitoring)

### Preparations for Preterm Labour

- Fetal lung maturity
- Availability of NICU
- Avoid teratogens
- Use regional anesthesia if possible
- Avoid stimulating the myometrium to prevent preterm labour

## General Anaesthesia (GA) Considerations

- **Pulmonary Aspiration**:
	
	- Employ rapid-sequence technique prior to intubation
	- Extubate only when awake and protective airway reflexes have returned
	- Reduce risk with 8 hours fasting, H2 blocker (ranitidine), clear antacid (sodium citrate), or metoclopramide
- **Anemia**:
	
	- Hemoglobin concentrations usually >9 g/dL, but levels as low as 7 g/dL generally safe
- **Decreased Plasma Cholinesterase**:
	
	- Prolongs the effect of succinylcholine
- **Volatile Agents**:
	
	- Avoid excessive concentrations to prevent increased uterine blood loss
- **Intravenous Opioids**:
	
	- Minimal effects on neonates when used intraoperatively, except meperidine, morphine, and hydromorphone
- **Postanesthetic Breastfeeding**:
	
	- Immediate breastfeeding is supported; "pump and dump" for 24 hours is outdated

### Key Points

1. Avoid hypoxemia, hypotension, acidosis, and hyperventilation
2. Respiratory: Careful pre-oxygenation, rapid-sequence induction (RSI), maintain normal ventilation
3. Cardiovascular (CVS): 15° lateral tilt from 20 weeks, avoid excessive peritoneal pressures during laparoscopic surgery
4. Drugs: Propofol, barbiturates, opioids, muscle relaxants, and local anesthetics generally safe; avoid N₂O and benzodiazepines
5. Fetal Monitoring: Only if the fetus is viable and fetal distress (FD) is actionable; tocolysis if contractions occur

## Pharmacological Considerations

### Physiological Changes

- Increased total body water → Increased volume of distribution (Vd) for water-soluble drugs
- Increased total body fat → Increased Vd for fat-soluble drugs
- Decreased albumin → Reduced protein binding → Increased free fraction of drugs
- Increased cardiac output (CO) → Increased hepatic and renal blood flow → Increased clearance

### Drugs

- **Volatile agents**: Decrease uterine tone and reduce uterine blood flow
- **Propofol**: Reduces uterine blood flow
- **Ketamine**: Increases uterine tone
- **Opioids**: Can cause fetal bradycardia and loss of baseline variability
- **Heparin**: Does not cross the placenta

## Teratogens

### Effects and Risks

- Anaesthetic drugs can affect cell signaling, mitosis, and DNA synthesis, impacting cellular differentiation and organogenesis
- Teratogen: Substance that increases the incidence of defects in a fetus; dose, duration, and timing are crucial
- Congenital anomalies: Background incidence ~3%
- Physiologic derangements like hypoxemia, hypercarbia, stress, and hypotension can be teratogenic
- No clear evidence of danger from anaesthetic drugs to human fetuses; no optimal anaesthetic technique established
- Timing: First 15 days (all-or-nothing phenomenon), organogenesis (15-56 days: structural abnormalities), post-organogenesis (functional changes)

### Nitrous Oxide

- Inhibits methionine synthetase, necessary for DNA synthesis
- Teratogenic effects shown in animals with high concentrations for prolonged periods, not typically encountered in clinical practice
- Avoid in pregnant women

# Different Surgeries

## Cardiac Surgery
- **Cardiovascular Changes in Pregnancy:**
  - 30–50% increase in blood volume and cardiac output, peaking at 24–28 weeks gestation.
- **Risks with Cardiopulmonary Bypass:**
  - Increased perioperative risk, particularly for the fetus.
  - Factors adversely affecting fetal oxygenation:
	- Non-pulsatile perfusion.
	- Inadequate perfusion pressures.
	- Inadequate pump flow.
	- Embolic phenomena to the uteroplacental bed.
	- Release of renin and catecholamines.

### Factors Important During Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Maternal Cardiac Surgery
- High pump flows (30–50% increase over the non-pregnant state).
- Mean arterial/perfusion pressure >65 mm Hg for optimal uteroplacental perfusion.
- Hematocrit >28%.
- Limit hypothermia (<32°C associated with higher fetal mortality).
- Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring.
- Optimize acid-base balance, glucose, PaO2, and PaCO2.

## Neurosurgery
- **Effects of Hypotension and Hyperventilation:**
  - Reduction in systolic arterial pressure by 25–30% or a mean arterial pressure <70 mm Hg reduces uteroplacental blood flow.
  - Hyperventilation to reduce PaCO2 and cerebral blood flow can cause uterine artery vasoconstriction and leftward shift of the maternal oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.
- **Mannitol Use:**
  - Slowly accumulates in the fetus, causing reduced fetal lung fluid production, reduced renal blood flow, and increased plasma sodium concentration.
  - Safe in small doses (0.25–0.5 mg/kg) without ill effects on the fetus.

## Laparoscopy
- **Potential Mechanisms of Injury:**
  - Direct fetal and uterine trauma.
  - Fetal acidosis from insufflated carbon dioxide absorption.
  - Decreased maternal cardiac output and uteroplacental perfusion with increased intra-abdominal pressure.
- **Timing of Surgery:**
  - Whenever possible, surgery should be deferred to the second trimester.

### Factors Important in Maternal Laparoscopy
- Use an open technique to enter the abdomen.
- Monitor maternal end-tidal PCO2 (4–4.6 kPa range) to avoid fetal hypercarbia and acidosis.
- Maintain low pneumoperitoneum pressure (1.1–1.6 kPa) or use a gasless technique.
- Limit the extent of Trendelenburg or reverse Trendelenburg positions and initiate any position slowly.
- Monitor fetal heart rate and uterine tone when feasible.

## Tubal Ligation
- **Timing of Procedure:**
  - Immediately following delivery and repair of the uterus during a caesarean section.
  - Delayed 8 to 48 hours post-delivery to allow an elective fasting period.
  - Deferred until after the postpartum period (generally 6 weeks).
- **Anesthesia Considerations:**
  - Continuous epidural anesthesia may be left in place up to 48 hours for postpartum sterilization.
  - Regional anesthesia preferred due to lower risk of pulmonary aspiration.
  - Spinal anesthesia often preferred over epidural due to faster onset, greater blockade density, and reliability.
  - For spinal anesthesia, use bupivacaine (8–12 mg) or lidocaine (60–75 mg). For epidural anesthesia, use lidocaine 1.5% to 2% or chloroprocaine 3%.
  - General endotracheal anesthesia is preferred for laparoscopic tubal fulguration due to risks associated with gas insufflation.

# Fetal Monitoring
- **Viable Fetus (24-26 Weeks):**
  - Fetal heart rate (FHR) should be monitored; may be difficult in obese patients or during abdominal surgery.
  - Inhalation agents reduce FHR variability, indicating potential fetal hypoxemia.
- **General Guidelines:**
  - Pre-viable fetus: Doppler check before and after the procedure.
  - Viable fetus: Simultaneous electronic FHR and contraction monitoring before and after the procedure.
  - Intraoperative monitoring is appropriate if:
	- The fetus is viable.
	- It is feasible to perform intraoperative electronic FHR monitoring.
	- An obstetrician is available and willing to intervene for fetal indications.
	- Informed consent for emergency caesarean delivery is obtained.
	- Planned surgery allows safe interruption for emergency delivery.

# Neurosurgery in Pregnancy
- **Anaesthetic Management:**
  - Controlled hypotension, hypothermia, hyperventilation, and diuresis must be managed carefully.
  - Controlled hypotension induced with high-dose volatile anaesthetic, sodium nitroprusside, or nitroglycerin, all of which cross the placenta and reduce uteroplacental blood flow.
  - Hyperventilation to reduce cerebral blood flow, with extreme hyperventilation (PaCO2 <3.3 kPa) causing uterine artery vasoconstriction.
  - Diuresis using osmotic agents or loop diuretics, with small doses of mannitol (0.25–0.5 mg/kg) considered safe.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Fetal heart rate monitoring is crucial to detect fetal condition compromises.
