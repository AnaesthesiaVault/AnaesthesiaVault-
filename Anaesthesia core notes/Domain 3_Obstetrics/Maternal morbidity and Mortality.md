# 5 H's and 5 C's in Relation to Preventing Maternal Mortality

## Reduction in Maternal Deaths
### 5 H's
  - **HIV & TB**
  - **Haemorrhage**
  - **Hypertension**
  - **Monitoring and Evaluation**
  - **Audit Cycle and Death Review Meetings**

### 5 C's
  - **Care: Quality of Care**
  - **Coverage**
  - **Safe Caesarean Section (CS)**
  - **Contraception**
  - **Community**

#### Key Components
- **Knowledgeable and Skilled HCW** (ESMOE-EOST)
- **Appropriately Resourced Facilities** (including maternity waiting areas)
- **Rapid and Reliable Emergency Transport 24/7**

## The "What" Consists of the 5 H's

**Three Basic Building Blocks for the Health System**:
1. **Improve Health Worker Training**:
   - Train all HCPs involved in maternity care in the ESMOE-EOST program and obstetric anaesthetic module.
   - Train all HCPs in HIV screening and treatment protocols.
2. **Strengthen Health System**:
   - Ensure 24-hour access to functioning emergency obstetric care (both basic and comprehensive).
   - Promote where appropriate maternity waiting areas.
   - Accessible and appropriate contraceptive services for all women.

**Targeted Activities**:
1. **Reduce Deaths due to HIV and TB**:
   - Promote preventive measures.
   - Health care workers (HCP) actively screen for HIV co-infections and treat especially TB.
2. **Reduce Deaths due to Haemorrhage**:
   - Promote preventive interventions.
   - HCP involved in EOST exercises on haemorrhage.
3. **Reduce Deaths due to Hypertension**:
   - Promote preventive measures (e.g., calcium supplementation).
   - HCP involved in EOST exercises on hypertension.

- ESMOE: Essential Steps in Management of Obstetric Emergencies.
- EOST: Emergency Obstetric Simulation Training.

## The 5 C's

**Care: Commitment to Quality**:
- **Who**:
  - DCSTs and clinical heads of department to improve clinical governance, clinical supervision, response to local audit findings, and leadership functions.
  - HCPs to make themselves available for training, to participate in drills, and to behave in a professional manner.
  - Managers to ensure emergency drills performed regularly and to evaluate and accredit HCWs to ensure they have appropriate skills.

**Coverage**:
- **Who**:
  - District managers to ensure all effective interventions are implemented in maternity services, especially for the poorest section of the population.
  - EMS to ensure transport from home to institution and between institutions.
  - CEOs to include maternity waiting areas where appropriate.
  - Use MomConnect to communicate with the community.

**Caesarean Section Safety**:
- **Who**:
  - CEOs and district managers rationalize resources to ensure skills and facilities available 24/7.
  - HCW have skills to perform safe CS, including safe anaesthesia.
  - DCSTs specific training package to be implemented.

**Contraception**:
- **Who**:
  - All HCW to motivate people to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
  - Managers to ensure various modalities are always available.
  - WBOTs to identify women requiring contraception, and refer.
  - Use MomConnect to communicate with the community.

**Community Involvement**:
- **Who**:
  - Health facility management to engage with community health committees.
  - WBOTs convey the essential maternity and baby care messages to all pregnant and postnatal women.
  - Use MomConnect to communicate with the community.

**Abbreviations**:
- HCP: Health Care Professional
- DCSTs: District Clinical Specialist Teams
- CEOs: Chief Executive Officers
- WBOTs: Ward Based Outreach Teams
- EMS: Emergency Medical Services
- CS: Caesarean Section
