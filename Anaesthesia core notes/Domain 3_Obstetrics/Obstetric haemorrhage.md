# Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314150035.png)

# Introduction
- In Africa and Asia, obstetric haemorrhage accounts for more than 30% of all maternal deaths compared to 11.4% in the USA between 2006 and 2010.
- The rate of transfusion in obstetrics is relatively low, ranging from 0.9% to 2.3%.

## General Anaesthesia for Placental Pathology
**Blood Products:**
- Increased bleeding risk.
- Check Hb, G&S, X match.
- Administer tranexamic acid 1g if bleeding occurs.
- Measure blood loss by clinical signs rather than estimations.

**Neuraxial vs GA:**
- Neuraxial anaesthesia is preferred for elective LSCS in cases of placenta previa (consensus expert opinion), as it may decrease blood loss and reduce the need for blood transfusions due to lower arterial blood pressure.
- Counsel on the possibility of conversion to GA (conversion rate 8-45%, mainly due to unexpected placental pathology).
- GA offers the shortest duration from decision to caesarean section but is associated with greater neonatal complications.
- GA is indicated for unstable patients, those actively bleeding, or those who are coagulopathic.

# Ante Partum Haemorrhage
- Occurs in 6% of all pregnancies.
- Approximately half of the cases have an unknown origin.

## Causes
- Uterine atony
- Placenta previa
- Abruptio placentae
- Uterine rupture
## Placenta Previa

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314151648.png)

### Pathogenesis

- **Previous C/S**
- **Multiple gestation**
- **Maternal smoking**

### Clinical Findings

- **Placenta Previa**: Presence of placental tissue extending over the internal cervical os.
	- **Risk Factors**:
		- Previous placenta previa
		- Increased maternal age
		- Increased parity

### Types

1. **Total Placenta Previa**: Placenta completely covers the cervix.
2. **Partial Placenta Previa**: Placenta partially covers the cervix.
3. **Marginal Placenta Previa**: Placenta is near the edge of the cervix.

### Diagnosis

- Diagnosed early in pregnancy via routine abdominal ultrasound at 18-20 weeks.

### Mechanism

- **Stretching of lower segment of uterus during 3rd trimester**:
	- **Scenario 1**: Stretching elongates the space between cervix and placenta, relocating the lower edge away from the cervical os.
		- Outcome: Placenta previa resolves on its own.
		- Reassuring if placenta >2cm from cervical os on ultrasound.
	- **Scenario 2**: Stretching fails to move placenta away from cervical os.
		- Outcome: Previa persists as uterus changes in preparation for labor.
		- Thinning of the lower segment and uterine contractions.
		- Shearing forces lead to painless bright red vaginal bleeding (90%).
		- Increased risk of clinically significant hemorrhage (10%).

### Complications

- Uterine contractions
- Cervix becomes thinner (effaced) and opens (dilates)
- Bleeding limits oxygen delivery to placenta, injuring placental tissue.
	- Activates intracellular G-protein signaling pathways.
	- Release of stored intracellular calcium leads to myometrial contraction and bleeding.

### Notes on Physical Exam

- Avoid bimanual exam during vaginal bleed until placenta previa is ruled out (2nd trimester onwards).
- Pelvic exam risk if patient presents with bleeding.
- Use transvaginal ultrasound to confirm placenta location.

## Placenta Accreta

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314151512.png)

### Incidence and Implantation
- The placenta implants in advance of the foetal presenting part.
- Occurs in 0.5% of pregnancies (1 in 200 pregnancies).

### Risk Factors
- Previous caesarean section.
- Uterine myomectomy.
- Multiparity.
- Advanced maternal age.
- Large placenta.

### Presentation
- Painless vaginal bleeding.

### Obstetric Management
- Plan delivery at 37 weeks gestation.

### Considerations
- **Pregnancy Considerations:**
  - Difficult intubation.
  - Risk of aspiration.
  - Quick desaturation.
  - Aortocaval compression.
  - Managing care for two patients (mother and fetus).
- **Increased Risks:**
  - Antepartum haemorrhage requiring resuscitation and possibly emergency delivery.
  - Intra-operative blood loss due to:
	- Injury by obstetrician to an anteriorly located placenta during uterine incision.
	- Low uterine tone at the lower uterine segment implantation site.

### Types
1. **Accreta:** Placenta adhered to the myometrium without invasion through uterine muscle.
   - The risk of placenta accreta spectrum increases with each previous caesarean delivery:
	 - 1st C-section: 3%
	 - 2nd C-section: 11%
	 - 3rd C-section: 40%
	 - 4th C-section: 61%
	 - 5th or more C-sections: 67%

2. **Increta:** Invasion into the myometrium.
3. **Percreta:** Invasion through the uterine serosa and possibly into other structures.
## Abruptio Placenta

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314151911.png)

### Risk Factors

- **Abdominal trauma**
- **Cocaine use in pregnancy**
- **Hypertension in pregnancy**
- **Polyhydramnios** (excess amniotic fluid)
- **Chorioamnionitis** (inflamed and infected placenta)
- **Maternal age, parity, and smoking status**
- **Previous ischemic placenta** (Hx of IUGR, abruption, preeclampsia)

### Pathogenesis

- **Rupture of maternal vessels anchoring placenta** (rarely fetal vessels).
- **Blood accumulates in decidua basalis layer**.
- **Continued bleeding** until partial or complete separation of placenta.
- **Portion of placenta not attached to uterus** is unable to partake in gas and nutrient exchange.
- **Remaining portion of placenta** cannot compensate adequately, leading to fetal hypoxia.

### Severity
- Most cases are mild (Grade I).
- Up to 25% of cases are severe (Grade III).

### Clinical Findings

- **If bleed is self-limited and small**: No abnormalities on physical exam.
- **Placental separation activates nociceptors**: Abdominal pain ± back pain (if posterior).
- **Uterus contracts at point of separation**: Firm ± tender uterus.
- **Concealed separation**: Abdominal pain ± uterine contractions without vaginal bleeding.
- **Complete separation**: Abrupt onset vaginal bleeding.
- **Large blood volume lost**: Maternal hypotension.
- **Fetus increases heart rate**: Fetal tachycardia.
- **Over time, fetal fatigue**: Fetal bradycardia, absent accelerations, late decelerations, decreased scalp pH (<7.25).

### Notes

- **Abruption can be partial or complete**.
- **Abruption can cause onset of labor**.
- **Couvelaire uterus**: Blood extravasated into the myometrium.

### Complications
- **Coagulopathy:**
  - Fibrinogen levels:
	- Mildly reduced (150–250 mg/dL) with moderate abruptions.
	- Less than 150 mg/dL with foetal demise.
  - Activation of circulating plasminogen (fibrinolysis) and release of tissue thromboplastins precipitating DIC.
  - Low platelet count, and factors V and VIII.
  - Elevated fibrin split products.

### Management
- **Urgency of Delivery:**
  - Depends on the severity of abruption.
  
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Establish large bore IV access.
  - Draw blood work.
  - Ensure close maternal and foetal monitoring.
  - Cross match and prepare for massive haemorrhage.
- **Urgent Cesarean:**
  - Indicated for significant abruption with maternal or fetal compromise.
  - General anaesthesia with rapid sequence induction (ketamine and succinylcholine) if there is hemodynamic compromise.
- **Aggressive Volume Resuscitation:**
  - Use invasive monitors.
  - Control and treat haemorrhage using:
	- Massive transfusion protocol.
	- Rapid infuser.
	- Avoid acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy.
	- Administer uterotonics.
	- Blood conservation techniques:
	  - Tranexamic acid.
	  - Cell saver.
	  - Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa).
	  - Surgical techniques.

## Uterine Rupture

- **Risk factors:**
	- Dehiscence of a scar of previous C/S, extensive myomectomy or uterine reconstruction; intrauterine manipulations or use of forceps (iatrogenic); (3) spontaneous rupture following prolonged labour in patients with hypertonic contractions (particularly with oxytocin infusions), fetopelvic disproportion, or a very large, thin, and weakened uterus.
- **Presentation:**
	- Hemorrhage, fetal distress, loss of uterine tone, hypotension with occult bleeding into the abdomen, or a combination of these
# Post Partum Haemorrhage

## Definition
- **Minor PPH**: Blood loss >500 mL, regardless of delivery mode.
- **Major PPH**: Blood loss >1000 mL.
- **Severe PPH**: Blood loss >2000 mL and/or transfusion of ≥4 PRBC.
- **Timing**:
  - **Early/Primary**: Within 24 hours of delivery.
  - **Late/Secondary**: More than 24 hours after delivery.

## Pathogenesis
- **Remember the four T's**:
  1. **Tissue**:
	 - Complete detachment and expulsion of the placenta are necessary for adequate uterine contractions and blood vessel occlusion.
	 - Delayed spontaneous expulsion.
	 - Incomplete delivery.
	 - Retained tissue felt inside the uterus or seen on ultrasound.
	 - Elevated INR, PTT, PT indicating impaired maternal coagulation.
  2. **Thrombus**:
	 - Fibrin deposition and occlusion of placental-supplying vessels.
	 - Placental abruption.
	 - Pre-eclampsia.
	 - Damage to fetoplacental tissue.
	 - Widespread endothelial damage.
	 - Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
	 - Pre-existing maternal coagulopathy.
  3. **Tone**:
	 - Blood supply through the myometrium, occluded as uterine muscle fibers contract.
	 - Multiple pregnancy, polyhydramnios, macrosomia.
	 - General anesthesia.
	 - Prolonged labor or rapid labor.
	 - Over-distended uterus weakens uterine muscles.
	 - Inadequate muscle tone.
  4. **Trauma**:
	 - Uterus and birth canal exposed to significant forces during delivery.
	 - Instrumental deliveries.
	 - Cephalopelvic disproportion.
	 - Ruptured uterus.
	 - Prolonged 2nd stage of labor.

## Complications
- Delayed spontaneous expulsion.
- Incomplete delivery.
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- Elevated INR, PTT, PT.
- Ruptured uterus.
- Emergency C-section.

## Notes
- **Following resuscitation**: Dilutional coagulopathy may occur, exacerbating bleeding.
- **Uterine atony**: Accounts for 70% of all PPH cases.
- **Maternal mortality**: Leading cause in developing countries; 6th most important direct cause in the developed world.
- **Prevalence**: Occurs in 5% of all deliveries.
- **EBL**: Defined as vaginal delivery with >500 mL or C-section with >1000 mL.
- **Underestimation**: EBL can be underestimated by up to 50%; visual estimation reliability decreases with actual blood loss increase.
- **4 T's Causes**: Uterine atony (tone), retained placental products (tissue), genital tract trauma (trauma), coagulation abnormalities (thrombin).

## Risk Factors for Postpartum Hemorrhage

### "T" Factors
- **Prepartal**:
  - **Tonus, Trauma**: Previous uterine atony, surgery, uterine myomatosus, overdistension, multiple pregnancy, polyhydramnios, fetal macrosomia.
  - **Tissue**: Previous abruption, placenta previa, abnormal placentation.
  - **Thrombin**: Hereditary or acquired coagulopathy.
- **Intrapartal or Postpartal**:
  - **Tonus, Trauma**: Uterine atony, rupture, inversion, lacerations.
  - **Tissue**: Placental retention.
  - **Thrombin**: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- **Other causes**:
  - Previous hemorrhage, multipara, pregnancy-associated hypertension, amniotic infection, smoking, prolonged labor, induced labor, prolonged augmentation with oxytocin, instrumental delivery, cesarean section.
- **Specific Risk Factors**: Maternal age >34 years, multiple pregnancy, fibroids, preeclampsia, amnionitis, placenta previa, placental abruption, cervical laceration, uterine rupture, vaginal instrumental delivery, and C-section.

## Clinical Recognition
- **Blood Estimation**: Often poorly done.
- **Rule of 30**: Indicates 30% total blood volume lost if the following seen:
  - Hb reduction by 30%
  - UO <30 mL/hr
  - HR increased by 30 bpm
  - sBP decreased by 30 mmHg
  - RR >30 bpm
- **Shock Index**: HR/sBP
  - Increased shock index indicates worsening hemorrhage.
  - Upper limit of normal: 0.9
  - >1.7 associated with requirement for >4 units PRBC, increased risk of hysterectomy, ICU admission, and death.
## Management

# Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) Treatment Algorithm

## Uterine Atony Management

### Step 1
- **Duration**: Should not exceed 30 minutes.
- **Goals**:
  - Recognize PPH.
  - Establish monitoring and identify the cause of bleeding (4 T's: Tissue, Thrombus, Tone, Trauma).
  - Increase uterine tone.
  - Inform the obstetric consultant and anaesthesiologist.
  - Establish 2 large-bore IV lines with crossmatched blood, insert a catheter.
  - Optimal volume resuscitation.

#### Increase Uterine Tone
- **Manual Methods**:
  - Removal of retained placental tissue.
  - Uterine massage.
  - Bimanual uterine compression.
  
- **Pharmacological Methods (stepwise)**:
  1. **Oxytocin**:
	 - 10–30 units in 1-liter isotonic saline or Lactated Ringers, given as an infusion.
	 - Avoid rapid infusion or bolus to prevent peripheral vasodilatation, increased cardiac output, tachycardia, hypotension, and potential myocardial ischemia.
	 - Slow infusion or slow bolus injection (over minutes) is recommended.
	 - If uterine tone is not adequate, add 10–20 units to the existing liter bag to increase the dose.
  2. **Methylergonovine** (a-adrenergic stimulation):
	 - 0.2 mg IM, produces significant tetanic uterine contractions.
	 - Relatively contraindicated in patients with hypertension, preeclampsia, myocardial ischemia, or pulmonary hypertension.
  3. **Prostaglandins**:
	 - **Misoprostol**: 800 mg rectally or sublingually.
	 - **15-methyl prostaglandin F2a (Carboprost)**: 250 mg IM, repeatable every 15–30 minutes up to 2 mg total. Contraindicated in asthma or respiratory insufficiency.
	 - **Sulprostone (a prostaglandin E2 analog)**: Given via infusion pump, max dose 1500 mg/24h. Initial dose up to 500 mg in first 60 minutes. Side effects include decreased peripheral vascular resistance, shivering, fever, nausea, and vomiting.

### Step 2
- **Duration**: Maximum 30 minutes.
- **Actions**:
  - Anticipate and treat coagulopathy.
  - If hemodynamically unstable, proceed to Step 3.
  - Call the anesthesiologist to the labor ward.
  - Manual placental removal or curettage for placental retention.
  - Order blood products based on thromboelastographic (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) guidance.
	- Normal TEG values for term pregnant patients: Max amplitude 64–86 mm.
	- Normal ROTEM values: Clot firmness 15–38 mm (FIBTEM).
	- PPH-related haemostasis impairment: 39% decrease in fibrinogen concentration, 20% decrease in TEG clot firmness. Minor changes in aPTT and INR (12–15%).
	- Trigger for massive transfusion protocol: Blood loss of 1500 ml with ongoing loss.

#### Pharmacological Management
- **Tranexamic Acid**:
  - Recommended dose: 2 g (intermediate dose).
- **Fibrinogen**:
  - Normal in term pregnancy: 4.5–5.8 g/L.
  - Each 1 g/L decrease in fibrinogen increases the odds of severe PPH by 2.6 times.
  - Baseline fibrinogen <2 g/L predicts severe PPH.
  - Restore fibrinogen to normal pregnancy levels (4–6 g/L) for effective hemorrhage control.
  - Fibrinogen concentrate is as effective as cryoprecipitate and may reduce massive transfusion needs.
- **Recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa)**:
  - Expensive, off-label treatment with conflicting opinions on efficacy.
  - Effective clot formation requires adequate platelet and fibrinogen levels.
  - Ensure physiological temperature and pH for optimal efficacy.

### Step 3
- **Goals**: Establish hemodynamic stability, temporarily stop bleeding, treat coagulopathy and anaemia.
- **Actions**:
  - Consider transfer and activate consultant.
  - Intrauterine gauze tamponade or uterine compression suture.
  - Intrauterine balloon tamponade.

### Step 4
- **Surgery or Interventional Radiology**:
  - **Hemodynamically Unstable**:
	- Surgical phases:
	  1. **Laparotomy** (Pfannenstiel or vertical). Uterus cranial traction with uterine massage. Vascular clamps on uterine and hypogastric vessels.
	  2. **Stabilization** of hypovolemia, coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia (in OR or ICU).
	  3. **Definitive Surgery**: Compression sutures (e.g., B-Lynch), vessel ligation, or hysterectomy. Alternative: Invasive radiology and embolization.
  - **Hemodynamically Stable**:
	- Proceed to definitive surgical repair or invasive radiology as per phase 3.

## General Considerations
- **Clinical Recognition**:
  - **Blood Estimation**: Often underestimated by up to 50%.
  - **Rule of 30**: Indicates 30% total blood volume loss if:
	- Hb reduction by 30%.
	- UO <30 mL/hr.
	- HR increased by 30 bpm.
	- sBP decreased by 30 mmHg.
	- RR >30 bpm.
  - **Shock Index (HR/sBP)**:
	- Upper limit of normal: 0.9.
	- >1.7 indicates requirement for >4 units PRBC, higher risk of hysterectomy, ICU admission, and death.
- **Leading cause of maternal mortality** in developing countries.
- **6th most important direct cause** in developed countries.
- **PPH incidence**: 5% of all deliveries.

## Massive Transfusion Protocol in Obstetrics

- The MTP comprises six O negative uncrossmatched RBCs, four units of AB plasma, and one apheresis platelet unit. If results of the antibody screen are known, type-specific RBCs can be issued, time permitting.
- Thawed group A plasma may be an acceptable alternative to liquid AB plasma as the first option for plasma therapy in emergencies.
- In a retrospective review of blood component therapy used at a single obstetric center for PPH management:
  - Plasma, cryoprecipitate, and/or platelets were required by:
	- 12% of women transfused with 0–3 units of RBCs.
	- 46% of women transfused with 4–7 units of RBCs.
	- 100% of women transfused with eight or more units of RBCs.
- The ideal ratio of plasma to RBC for obstetric hemorrhage remains uncertain. The ratios of the blood product components of our MTP are designed to be in proportion to whole blood, aiming to minimize the effects of dilutional coagulopathy and hypovolemia.
- The fibrinogen threshold for progression to morbidity (more than 4 units RBCs) is 2.6 g/dL. This suggests that fibrinogen supplementation during obstetric hemorrhage may be required at a higher threshold than current guidelines recommend.
- TEG profiles in women with PPH (>2000 mL blood loss) show:
  - Faster clot initiation.
  - Reduced clot strength (alpha angle and maximum amplitude).
  - Depressed fibrinolysis compared to TEG profiles for normal delivery.
  - Fibrinogen levels decreased during PPH with strong correlations between maximum amplitude and fibrinogen levels.
- Compared to formula-driven strategies (fixed ratios of blood products), goal-directed resuscitation has been advocated for managing coagulopathy following trauma. Goal-directed resuscitation can incorporate a point-of-care strategy, using TEG or ROTEM for diagnosing altered hemostasis and evaluating treatment efficacy in correcting coagulopathy.

## Different Protocols

### Shock Pack/Empirical/Fixed Ratio Blood Product Administration
- **Ratio**: RBC:FFP 1:1 or 3:2
- **Strategy**: Trauma-derived; limited evidence for benefit in PPH.
- **Pros**: May reduce the risk of severe coagulopathy.
- **Cons**: Risk of fluid overload, Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI).

### Goal-Directed Fibrinogen Replacement
- Results in reduced transfusion volumes and complications related to fluid overload.

### Pragmatic Approach
- Designed for settings lacking ROTEM monitoring.
- **Ratio**: RBC:FFP:Platelets 6:4:1 (megapool).
- **Monitoring**:
  - Lab fibrinogen.
  - Ward hemoglobin.
  - Arterial Blood Gas (ABG).
- **Management**:
  - Limit FFP to 4 units, then use cryoprecipitate to maintain fibrinogen >2 g/L.
  - Maintain platelet count >50 × 10^9/L.

## Blood Conservation Strategies

1. **Treatment of Ante-Partum Iron-Deficiency Anemia**:
   - Oral or IV iron (target hemoglobin: 11 g/dL).

2. **Treatment of Post-Partum Anemia**:
   - IV iron versus blood transfusion.

3. **Cell Salvage**:
   - Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) showed no harm, but the SALVO trial showed no reduction in transfusion rate; not included in AAGBI guidelines.
   - Recommended in high-risk cases.
   - **Safe to Use**: Risks comparable to non-obstetric cases (including Amniotic Fluid Embolism - Safe).
   - **Modifications**:
	 - Only collect after the delivery of the placenta.
	 - Use leucocyte filter.
	 - Pressurize infusion bag to 300 mmHg to increase flow to 80 mL/min.
	 - Adjust RhoGAM dose.

4. **Tranexamic Acid**:
   - WOMAN trial showed a weak signal for improving outcomes, but use is recommended due to low risk.
