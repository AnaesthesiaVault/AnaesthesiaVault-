# Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)

## General

### Pathophysiology
- OHSS is a complication of fertility treatments that use pharmacological ovarian stimulation to increase the number of oocytes and embryos available during assisted reproductive technology (ART).
- The condition is primarily due to exposure of the ovaries to human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) or luteinising hormone (LH) following controlled ovarian stimulation by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
- OHSS is characterized by cystic enlargement of the ovaries and increased capillary permeability, leading to transudation of fluid and proteins from the intravascular compartment into the third space, resulting in multi-organ dysfunction.

## Signs and Symptoms
- The exposure of hyperstimulated ovaries to hCG leads to the production of proinflammatory mediators, predominantly vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), with various cytokines likely involved in the pathogenesis and clinical features of OHSS.
- Clinical features include:
  - Ovarian enlargement
  - Increased vascular permeability
  - Prothrombotic effects
  - Local and systemic effects of proinflammatory mediators

## Management
1. **Volume Replacement:**
   - Use crystalloid or colloid solutions Â± Albumin or 6% HES.
   - Correct electrolyte imbalances (hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia).

2. **Renal Hypoperfusion:**
   - Consider using dopamine.
   - Diuretics are contraindicated in cases of fluid depletion.

3. **Fluid Accumulation:**
   - Perform abdominal or thoracocentesis as needed.
   - Manage respiratory insufficiency appropriately.

4. **Thromboprophylaxis:**
   - Ensure appropriate prophylactic measures against venous thromboembolism (VTE).

5. **Specific Agents (Prophylaxis):**
   - Insulin sensitizing agents
   - Dopamine agonists
   - NSAIDs

## Anaesthesia Considerations
- **Fluid Management:**
  - Strictly monitor and guide fluid management using cardiac output monitors and arterial line tracing.
  
- **Electrolyte Monitoring:**
  - Regularly check for electrolyte abnormalities, such as hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia.
- **Renal Function:**
  - Assess renal function as it may be affected by OHSS.
- **Imaging:**
  - Obtain chest X-ray (CXR) and echocardiogram (Echo) to check for pleural and pericardial effusions.
- **VTE Prophylaxis:**
  - Implement measures to prevent venous thromboembolism.
