# Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in Pregnancy

## Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of maternal mortality in much of the developed world.

## Risk Prediction

Risk stratification should ideally be done preconceptionally. Various risk scores are used, including CARPREG I, CARPREG II, and ZAHARA, which correlate with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

The World Health Organization (WHO) risk stratification model uses cumulative knowledge of lesion-specific risks to divide patients into four risk groups:

- **I**: Risk no greater than the general population
- **II**: Small increased risk of maternal death/complications
- **III**: Significant risk of maternal death/complications; requires expert cardiovascular and obstetric care
- **IV**: Pregnancy contraindicated due to very high risk

### WHO Class 4 Conditions (Counsel Patients Not to Fall Pregnant)

- **Mortality rates if pregnant**:
  - **Pulmonary Hypertension (30-60%)**:
	- Continue PDE-5 inhibitors, prostacyclins, calcium channel blockers, and nitric oxide.
	- Stop endothelin receptor antagonist (teratogenic).
  - **Eisenmenger Syndrome**
  - **Ejection Fraction (EF) < 30%**:
	- Stop ACE inhibitors/ARBs/Spironolactone, can use hydralazine for afterload reduction.
	- Beta-blockers (BB) can be used.
  - **NYHA Class 3-4**
  - **Severe Mitral Stenosis (MS)/Aortic Stenosis (AS)**:
	- Consider balloon valvuloplasty.
  - **Marfan Syndrome**
  - **Bicuspid Aortic Valve (AV)**
  - **Coarctation of the Aorta**
  - **Previous Peripartum Cardiomyopathy with Residual Symptoms (25%)**

### Complications

- Spontaneous abortions (20%)
- Intrauterine fetal demise
- Preterm birth rate (11%)
- Neonatal events (28%): Small for gestational age (SGA), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and neonatal death

## Peripartum Cardiomyopathy Diagnosis

**History & Examination**:
- Symptoms and signs of biventricular failure.

**Investigations**:
- **CXR**: Cardiomegaly/infiltrates.
- **ECG**: Sinus tachycardia.
- **Echocardiography**: Dilated left ventricular (LV) chamber, EF < 45%, increased left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD).
- **Biopsy**: Myocarditis (76% of cases).

## Management

### Principles

- Vaginal delivery is safest for most cardiac patients due to less blood loss, reduced infection rates, and lower thrombosis risk.
- Effective labor analgesia ensures greater cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic stability.
  - Early initiation of epidural labor analgesia is recommended.
  - Consider intrathecal opioid-only CSE or dural puncture epidural (DPE) techniques.
  - Use saline for epidural loss-of-resistance technique to avoid air embolism risk.
  - Consider local anesthetic-only test dose for epidural catheter.

### Combined Spinal-Epidural (CSE) Analgesia

- **Intrathecal Hyperbaric Bupivacaine**: 2.5–5 mg.
- **Fentanyl**: 15–25 μg.
- Followed by 2–3 mL epidural boluses of plain 0.5% bupivacaine or 2% lidocaine over 15-30 minutes.

### General Anesthesia (GA) Cardiac Recipe

- Premedicate with opioids or lidocaine and titrate induction agents slowly.
- Consider remifentanil premedication for caesarean delivery.
- For high-risk cardiac patients, use etomidate induction (0.1–0.3 mg/kg) with remifentanil either as a pre-induction infusion (0.2–0.5 μg/kg/min for 5–10 min) or as a single bolus (2–4 μg/kg).

### Postpartum Period

- High risk for maternal cardiac complications due to increased preload and "auto-transfusion" from the contracting uterus.
- Elevated preload persists due to extravascular fluid mobilization, with systemic vascular resistance rising over the first few weeks.
- Monitor oxygen saturation (>95%) and investigate any oxygen requirements.
- Use BNP or NT-proBNP to differentiate between normal pregnancy physiology and heart failure.
- Carefully titrate oxytocin to avoid hypotension and other complications.
- For postpartum hemorrhage, use oxytocin infusion and rectal/buccal misoprostol. Avoid carboprost and methylergonovine.

### Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) Treatment

- First-line: Vagal maneuvers and adenosine.
- If unsuccessful: Intravenous metoprolol or propranolol.
- If beta blockade fails: Verapamil and/or procainamide.
- Amiodarone is a last resort if SVT is life-threatening.
- For unstable patients: Perform immediate electrical cardioversion.
- Bradyarrhythmias: Temporary external or esophageal pacing is safe.

### Monitoring

- Standard plus:
  - Arterial line (A-line)
  - Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)
  - Cardiac output (CO) monitor
  - Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) for pulmonary hypertension (PHT)

### Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) in Pregnancy

### Physiologic Considerations

- **HOCM**: Depends on a well-filled LV to maintain output and decrease dynamic obstruction.
- **Pregnancy Exacerbations**: Increased HR, increased contractility, decreased SVR, aortocaval compression.
- **Management**:
	- Chronic beta-blockade should be continued throughout pregnancy.
	- Prefer vaginal delivery (NVD) to tolerate the second stage well due to increase in SVR.
	- Use ergometrine over oxytocin for uterotonic management.

### Goals

- **Maintain intravascular volume and venous return**:
	- Avoid aortocaval compression.
- **Maintain SVR**.
- **Slow HR**, maintaining sinus rhythm.
- **Aggressive treatment of tachyarrhythmias**.
- **Prevent increases in myocardial contractility**.

### Anaesthetic Management

- **Avoid single-shot spinal**.
- **Invasive haemodynamic monitoring**.
- **Gradual Epidural and Combined Spinal-Epidural**:
	- Slow graded epidural and combined spinal epidural with intrathecal opioid have been used safely.
- **Labour Analgesia**:
	- Epidural analgesia attenuates catecholamine release, reducing increases in heart rate and contractility.
- **Vasopressor Choice**:
	- Phenylephrine is the preferred vasopressor.
	- Ephedrine should be avoided due to potential increases in myocardial contractility.
- **Postpartum Management**:
	- Postpartum diuresis poses a risk for worsening of outflow tract obstruction.
### Aortic Dissection

### Presentation
**Asymptomatic**
- Typical or atypical chest pain

**Examination**
- Signs of acute left ventricular failure (usually due to aortic regurgitation secondary to aortic root dilatation)
- Signs of end organ damage depending on the level of the dissection

**Investigation**
- **Chest X-ray (CXR)**: Widened mediastinum
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**:
  - Sinus tachycardia
  - Arrhythmia
  - T wave inversion
  - ST segment depression
  - New left bundle branch block (LBBB)
  - Ectopic beats
- **Echocardiography (Echo)**:
  - Dissection
  - Aortic root dilatation
  - Aortic regurgitation
- **Computed Tomography (CT)**: Dissection
