# Introduction

## Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD)

Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) represents a spectrum of conditions arising from abnormal cellular proliferation of trophoblastic tissue of the developing placenta. It encompasses:

1. Complete and partial hydatidiform mole (non-invasive molar pregnancy)
2. Invasive hydatidiform mole
3. Choriocarcinoma
4. Placental site trophoblastic tumour

The last three forms can invade the myometrium and metastasise, collectively termed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). With chemotherapy, they are among the most curable solid tumours, with cure rates exceeding 90% even in metastatic disease.

### Incidence
- Global incidence: 0.57 to 2.00 per 1,000 pregnancies.
- South African incidence of molar pregnancy: ~1.2 per 1,000 deliveries.

### Pathophysiology

The placental trophoblast consists of:

1. Cytotrophoblast
2. Intermediate trophoblast
3. Syncytiotrophoblast (produces hCG)

Proliferation of these cells may result in GTD. Hydatidiform mole is characterised by varying degrees of trophoblastic hyperplasia and vesicles of swollen hydropic villi, associated with absent fetal tissue (complete mole) or abnormal fetal tissue (partial mole). GTN can develop in 15-20% of complete moles and 1-5% of partial moles, and after nonmolar gestation.

### Risk Factors
- Age: <20 or >35 years
- History of miscarriage
- Previous molar pregnancy (1-2%)
- Race: More common in South Asians and Africans
- Diet: Low in vitamin A, folic acid, and protein

### Associations with Hyperthyroidism
- Prevalence of hyperthyroidism in hydatidiform mole: 25-64%
- Clinical thyrotoxicosis in 5% of patients
- hCG stimulates TSH receptors on thyroid follicular cells, leading to increased T4 and T3 levels and suppression of TSH.
- Up to 20% of pregnant women have subnormal TSH levels in early pregnancy, with 1.4% experiencing transient gestational thyrotoxicosis.
- Molar hCG has greater thyrotropic potency due to lower sialic acid content.

### Clinical Presentation
- Commonly present in the second trimester with:
  - Vaginal bleeding (most common)
  - Anaemia
  - Excessive uterine enlargement
  - Theca lutein ovarian cysts
  - Hyperemesis gravidarum
  - Passing vesicles (grape-like tissue)
  - Pre-eclampsia
  - Abdominal pain
  - Hyperthyroidism
  - Respiratory distress

### Diagnosis
- **Ultrasonography:** Vesicular pattern with multiple echoes in placental mass ("snowstorm" or "bunch of grapes" appearance) and absent fetal tissue for complete mole; focal cystic spaces and presence of fetal tissue for partial mole.
- **β-hCG:** Elevated levels in hydatidiform moles. Stable or rising levels post-evacuation suggest GTN.

### Pathology
- Examination of curettage, biopsy, placenta, or hysterectomy specimens.

### Treatment
- **Suction curettage:** Preferred for evacuation of hydatidiform mole.
- **Hysterectomy:** Consider if fertility preservation is not required.
- **Chemotherapy:** Principal therapy for GTN, with or without surgery or radiation in high-risk disease.
- **Perioperative considerations:** Risk of heavy bleeding, pre-eclampsia, trophoblastic embolisation, respiratory insufficiency, cardiac failure, DIC, hyperemesis gravidarum.

### Differential Diagnosis for Hyperthyroidism in Pregnancy

#### Causes of Hyperthyroidism in Pregnancy

##### Primary Thyroid
- Graves’ disease
- Acute, subacute, or chronic thyroiditis
- Toxic adenoma
- Toxic multinodular goitre

##### Gestational
- Transient gestational thyrotoxicosis
- Multiple gestations
- Molar pregnancy
- TSH-receptor mutation
- Hyperplacentosis
- Hyperreactio luteinalis

##### Other
- Iatrogenic
- Struma ovarii
- TSH-producing pituitary adenoma

# Anaesthesia for Molar Pregnancy

## General

A multidisciplinary approach is required, present for evacuation or hysterectomy.

### History

Identify thyroid dysfunction and associated complications.

### Investigations
- FBC, U&E, thyroid hormones, ECG, crossmatch
- ABG, INR/PTT, LFT, CXR, and/or echo

### Pre-op Optimization
- Correct fluid deficits and electrolyte abnormalities.
- Transfuse if anaemic.
- Treat pre-eclampsia with MgSO₄.
- Manage hyperthyroidism:
  - **Antithyroid drugs:** Refer to endocrinology (PTU, carbimazole, methimazole)
  - **Beta-blockers:** Propranolol to control hyperadrenergic effects and decrease T4 to T3 conversion. Maintain HR < 100 bpm.
  - **Iodides:** Sodium iodide, potassium iodide, Lugol’s solution.
  - **Plasmapheresis:** For rapid improvement.
  - **In cases of bleeding:** Administer glucocorticoids and do not delay surgery.

## Technique
- **Neuraxial/GA:** Options include spinal (benefits: early detection of complications, avoiding airway manipulation) or GA (necessary for haemodynamically unstable patients).

### Monitoring
- Standard ± A-line/CVP, large bore IV access.

### Drugs
- Consider hypermetabolism.
- **Volatiles:** No increase in MAC; caution with uterine tocolytic effects.
- **Induction:** Thiopentone, propofol (increased dose), etomidate if unstable. Avoid ketamine.
- **Analgesia:** Fentanyl, sufentanil, paracetamol.
- **Esmolol infusion:** Helps control cardiovascular effects and may reduce blood loss.
- **Oxytocin infusion:** Administer after suction and cervical dilatation to prevent embolisation/metastasis.

### Post-op
- High care/ICU monitoring.

### Complications to Screen for if Thyroid Storm
- Hypertension
- Heart failure
- Thrombocytopenia
- Atrial fibrillation
- Muscle weakness
- Diarrhoea and electrolyte abnormalities
