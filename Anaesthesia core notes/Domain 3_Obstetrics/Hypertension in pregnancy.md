# Summary of PET

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314152640.png)

# Hypertension in Pregnancy

## Epidemiology
- Hypertension (HT) affects 8% of all pregnancies, with 1/3 developing pre-eclampsia (PET). Eclampsia incidence is 0.04%.
- Hypertensive disorders cause 15% of maternal mortality (M&M) and are the most common reason for ICU admissions during pregnancy.
- There is a notable contrast between the UK and South Africa (SA) regarding the rate of cardiopulmonary disease associated with PET, which is much higher in SA (34% vs. 0%).
### South African Setting
- Maternal mortality is 50 times higher in SA compared to high-income countries.
- The two most significant independent risk factors for maternal mortality in Africa are hemorrhage and complications of anesthesia.
- In the absence of epidural anesthesia for labor, spinal anesthesia is the preferred method for cesarean sections (CS), particularly in resource-limited settings.
## Definitions
- **Chronic Hypertension:** Predates pregnancy or is diagnosed before 20 weeks of gestation.
- **Gestational Hypertension:** New-onset hypertension that develops after 20 weeks of gestation without features of pre-eclampsia.
- **Pre-Eclampsia (PET):** New-onset HT (SBP ≥140 mmHg, DBP ≥90 mmHg) at or after 20 weeks of gestation with one or more of the following:
  - Proteinuria: urine protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) ≥30 mg/mmol, albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥8 mg/mmol.
  - Maternal organ dysfunction:
	- Acute kidney injury (increase in serum creatinine ≥90 mmol/L)
	- Liver dysfunction (elevated transaminases, increase in alanine transaminase ≥70 IU/L or twice the upper limit of normal)
	- Hematological abnormalities (thrombocytopenia)
	- Neurological complications (eclamptic seizures, severe headaches, persistent visual scotomata, clonus, blindness, altered mental status, or stroke).
  - Uteroplacental dysfunction (abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveform analysis, restricted fetal growth, or stillbirth).
## Treatment Options for Hypertension in Pregnancy
- **Labetalol (PO or IV):**
  - Mechanism of Action (MOA): Non-selective beta-blocker.
  - Note: Masks hypoglycemia in diabetes mellitus (DM) and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
  - Contraindications: >1st degree heart block, decompensated heart failure (HF), obstructive airways disease.
- **Methyldopa (PO):**
  - MOA: Alpha-2 receptor agonist.
  - Side Effects: Depression.
  - Contraindications: Acute porphyria, pheochromocytoma.
- **Nifedipine MR (PO):**
  - MOA: Calcium channel blocker.
  - Contraindications: Poor cardiac reserve, significantly impaired left ventricular function (LVF).
- **Hydralazine (IV):**
  - MOA: Opens K+ channels, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.
  - Side Effect: Tachycardia.
  - Contraindications: Acute porphyria, cor pulmonale, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
## Classification
- **Mild:** Systolic 140-149 mmHg and/or diastolic 90-99 mmHg.
- **Moderate:** Systolic 150-159 mmHg and/or diastolic 100-109 mmHg.
- **Severe:** Systolic ≥160 mmHg and/or diastolic ≥110 mmHg.
  - Symptoms: Severe headache, visual disturbance, vomiting, papilloedema, clonus >3 beats, liver tenderness, subcostal pain, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, HELLP syndrome.
## Severe PET
- BP >160/110 mmHg.
- Proteinuria >5 g/24 hours.
- Elevated serum creatinine or oliguria <500 mL/24 hours; doubling of serum creatinine in the absence of other renal disease.
- Grand mal seizures.
- Pulmonary edema.
- HELLP syndrome:
  - Can be normotensive (20%) and without proteinuria (5-15%).
  - Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000 mL).
  - Impaired liver function (AST or ALT ≥2x upper limit of normal).
- Growth restriction or oligohydramnios.
- Symptoms: Unresponsive headache, epigastric pain, visual disturbance.
- Note: BP is not a good indicator of clinical status and disease progression. Laboratory findings, symptoms, and proteinuria are better indicators.
## Pathogenic Mechanism
- Primarily ischemic in nature, involving reduced perfusion.
- **Summary:** Triad of inadequate placentation, placental insufficiency, and vascular reactivity.
- **Normal:** Trophoblasts invade the decidual and myometrial segments of the spiral arteries, causing dramatic increases in vessel diameter, loss of smooth muscle, and the inner elastic lamina. Normal maternal endothelium prevents platelet activation, activates circulating anticoagulants, buffers the response to pressors, and maintains fluid in the intravascular compartment.
- **2-Stage Disorder in PET:**
  1. Failure of remodeling of spiral arteries by cytotrophoblasts.
  2. Widespread endothelial dysfunction.
- **Alternative Theory:**
  - Early (<34 weeks) and late disease (>34 weeks) may have different mechanisms.
  - Classical triad is present in a minority of cases.
  - Maternal systemic and uterine vascular impairment may predate placental maldevelopment.
  - Increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and low cardiac output (CO) before conception put women at risk.
  - Shared cardiovascular predisposition to preeclampsia and cardiovascular disease supports current prophylaxis and management, including aspirin, statins, metformin, and antihypertensive agents.
## Systemic Manifestations
### Central Nervous System
- Seizures, cerebral vasospasm, thrombosis, cerebral edema, severe headache, visual disturbances, hyperexcitability, hyperreflexia, and coma.
### Airway
- **Difficult Intubation:** Mucosal capillary engorgement, pharyngolaryngeal edema.
- **Difficult Extubation:** Subglottic edema can result in airway obstruction.
### Pulmonary
- Pulmonary edema (70% 70 hours post-op):
  - Decreased colloid osmotic pressure.
  - Elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
  - Increased capillary permeability.
  - BNP higher in patients with IPE, suggesting cardiac dysfunction may be more important than colloid osmotic pressure in pulmonary edema generation.
### Cardiovascular
- Severe vasospasm: Increased BP and SVR.
- **75% of patients:** Hyperdynamic LV, mild to moderate increases in SVR, normal filling pressures.
- **25% of patients:** Decreased left ventricular function, markedly increased SVR, and severely decreased intravascular volume.
### Hematologic
- Thrombocytopenia (15-30%):
  - **Mild disease:** Hypercoagulable.
  - **Severe disease:** Relatively hypocoagulable.
### Hepatic
- HELLP syndrome and hepatic rupture/bleed.
- Spontaneous liver rupture is rare but associated with a 60% mortality rate.
### Renal
- Mild to moderate decreases in renal blood flow and GFR.
- Increased serum creatinine concentration.
- Oliguria is common, but progression to renal failure is rare.
### Uteroplacental
- Downstream resistance in the uteroplacental bed increases, leading to increased systolic/diastolic ratio and fetal compromise.
## Complications
### Acute
- **Maternal Complications:** Abruptio placentae, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, liver failure, stroke. Progression to eclamptic seizures may be associated with cytotoxic edema and cerebral infarction and/or vasogenic edema, loss of cerebral autoregulation, and increased capillary permeability. Intracranial complications are the most common cause of death.
- **Neonatal Complications:** Preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, perinatal death.
- **Risk Factors for Eclampsia:** Young maternal age, low body mass index.
### Chronic
- Diastolic and systolic dysfunction can persist in early-onset disease for at least one year.
- Increased risk for coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease, stroke, thromboembolism, white matter lesions post-eclampsia, diabetes, and end-stage renal disease.
- 11-14% of women with preeclampsia develop chronic hypertension within 10 years.
- Impaired memory and verbal learning may persist 15 years later.
### HELLP Syndrome

#### Pathogenesis

1. **Aberrant placental development and function**
	- Mechanism still under investigation
	- Polymorphisms of FasL and receptor gene
2. **Abnormal maternal immune tolerance of placentation in early pregnancy**
3. **Lesions in membrane separating maternal and fetal circulation**
4. **Release of inflammatory products from placenta into maternal circulation**
	- Increased levels of placental FasL in maternal circulation
5. **Systemic maternal inflammatory response**
	- Activation of coagulation and complement pathways
#### Clinical Findings

1. **Microvascular endothelial activation, dysfunction, and damage**
	- RBCs sheared as they flow through damaged vessels
		- Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)
		- Lab findings indicative of hemolysis: normocytic anemia, high LDH & bilirubin, low haptoglobin
2. **Widespread platelet aggregation and agglutination**
	- Reduced amount of platelets measurable on complete blood count
		- Low platelets
3. **Microthrombi in hepatic circulation**
	- Damage to hepatocytes
		- Elevated liver enzymes
### Fetal Complications
#### Pathogenesis

1. **Pre-eclampsia arises from:**
	- Placental under-perfusion, hypoxia, ischemia, and oxidative stress (starting in the first trimester)
#### Clinical Findings

1. **Perfusion Issues**
	- Filtration of fetal blood
		- Urine excretion into amniotic sac
		- **Oligohydramnios (AFI<5cm, or DVP<2cm)**
	- Fetus does not receive adequate nutrients needed to grow and develop in utero
		- **Fetal Growth Restriction (≤10th percentile)**
		- **Intrauterine fetal demise**
	- **Absent or reversed blood flow in umbilical arteries** (seen on Doppler ultrasound)
		- Indication for immediate induction of delivery (sometimes)
#### Complications

1. **Placental Abruption**
	
	- More fragile vascular connections between placenta and uterus
	- Easier separation of mother’s decidual basalis uterine layer from fetal vessels, especially over time (in the third trimester)
2. **Maternal Complications**
	
	- Uterine pain
	- Vaginal bleeding
	- Immediate fetal distress (i.e., abnormal fetal heart rate decelerations)
		- Need for premature delivery of fetus
3. **Complications of Prematurity**
## POCUS Signs of PET
- Increased left ventricular filling pressure (High E/e prime).
- Left ventricular hypertrophy (more severe if pre-existing).
- Increased inotropy.
- Increased SVR.
- Increased CO.
- Increased pericardial fluid.
- Increased pulmonary edema.
- Optic nerve sheath diameter (20% is reflective of ICP >20 mmHg).
- Note: 60% of PET POCUS are abnormal; 1/3 have pulmonary edema.
- Absence of IPE might exclude raised left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.
## Obstetric and Anaesthetic Management

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314152540.png)

## Problems with GA in PET
- Difficult airway with failed tracheal intubation
- Increased blood loss
- Rapid desaturation in the PET population
- Neurological complications due to intubation response (most common cause of death)
## Decision Algorithm for Spinal Vs GA
### Recommendations for Anaesthesia in Eclampsia

#### Spinal Anaesthesia
- Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) > 13
- Only 1 seizure
- Time frame > 12 hours (since last seizure)
- Concerns about airway or respiratory issues
### Clear-Cut Indications for General Anesthesia (GA)
- Confirmed HELLP syndrome with platelet count <75 x 10^9/L within 6 hours
- Eclampsia with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <14
- 2 seizures or more
- Focal neurological signs
- Likely coagulopathy:
  - Abruptio placentae with hemodynamic instability
  - Hepatic subcapsular hematoma
- Pulmonary edema with hypoxemia
### Flowchart for Decision-Making

1. **Clear-cut indications for GA**:
2. **No clear-cut indications**:
   - Determine platelet count:
	 - If unknown, draw blood and await results.
	 - If known, proceed based on platelet count.
	   - <50 x 10^9/L: GA.
	   - 50-75 x 10^9/L: GA unless Decision Aid favors SA.
	   - >75 x 10^9/L: SA if no contraindications.
   - Assess maternal and fetal status:
	 - If not reassuring, refer to Decision Aid and consider likelihood of platelet count <75 x 10^9/L.
	 - If reassuring, follow Decision Aid recommendations.
### Decision Aid for Assessment of Risk-Benefit of SA vs. GA
#### Factors to Consider
- **Timing:**
  - Category of urgency of CS
- **Training:**
  - Experience of anesthesia provider
  - Surgical expertise
- **Treatment:**
  - Clinical likelihood of platelet count <75 x 10^9/L:
	- Low if only hypertension is present
  - Comorbidities (obesity, difficult airway)
  - Severe features (e.g., HELLP syndrome, easy bleeding, obvious hemoglobinuria)
  - Availability of equipment
  - Availability of drugs
## Reasons Regional Anesthesia is Preferred

- **Avoid General Anesthesia (GA):** Regional anesthesia minimizes the risks associated with GA.
- **Patient Comfort:** Provides superior analgesia, enhancing patient comfort during labor.
- **Attenuation of Hypertensive Response:** Effective analgesia reduces the hypertensive response to pain.
- **Improved Maternal Blood Pressure Control:** Reduction in circulating catecholamines helps in controlling maternal blood pressure.
- **Uteroplacental Blood Flow:** Epidural analgesia may improve uteroplacental blood flow in preeclampsia.
- **Preferred Technique for Labor Analgesia:** Continuous lumbar epidural is favored due to unmatched patient comfort, attenuated hypertensive response, improved blood pressure control, and potential improvement in uteroplacental blood flow.

## Platelet Count Considerations for Regional Anesthesia

- **Individualized Approach:** National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend an individualized approach without a specific platelet count threshold.
- **SOAP Guidelines:**
  - Avoid regional anesthesia (RA) if platelet count is lower than 50 × 10^9/L.
  - The risk is very low if the platelet count is more than 70 × 10^9/L.
  - For HELLP syndrome, the timing of the last blood count should be within six hours.
  - SOAP allows for RA at a platelet count of 50-70 × 10^9/L in certain circumstances but not below 50 × 10^9/L.
- **Recent Recommendations:** Do not specify a particular platelet count below which RA is contraindicated but suggest individualization of the decision.
## Contraindications to Spinal Anesthesia in Pre-Eclampsia

### Absolute Contraindications
- Severe hypovolemia
- Thrombocytopenia
### Relative Contraindications
- Pulmonary edema with severe systolic dysfunction
- Comorbidities such as:
  - Clinically significant valvular heart disease (e.g., mitral stenosis)
  - Complicated grown-up congenital heart disease
  - Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
  - Pericardial effusion
## Additional Considerations
- **Dexamethasone:** Shown to increase platelet counts in HELLP syndrome.
- **Blood Pressure Control:**
  - Reduce BP to less than 160/110 mmHg using labetalol (5 mg boluses) or magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) (4 g IV slowly, followed by 1 g hourly).
  - Aim to reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 20% or achieve a BP of approximately 140/90 mmHg.
  - Blunt intubation response with a combination of MgSO4 (50 mg/kg), esmolol, lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg), or alfentanil (20 µg/kg). Phenylephrine is the vasopressor of choice.
- **Fluid Management:** Limit fluids to less than 80 mL/hour.
- **NSAIDs:** No association between NSAIDs and postpartum hypertension.
