# Definition and Management

## Maternal Sepsis

Maternal sepsis is a life-threatening condition defined as organ dysfunction resulting from infection during pregnancy, childbirth, post-abortion, or postpartum period.

## Management

### Within 1 Hour of Suspected Diagnosis

- **Obtain cultures and serum lactate**
- **Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics**
- **Initiate fluid therapy**:
	- Up to 30 mL/kg of crystalloid initially to maintain MAP >65 mm Hg
	- Lower values may be acceptable in pregnancy; individualize

### Hemodynamic Support

- **Start norepinephrine** through central line if MAP <65 mm Hg and evidence of hypoperfusion
- **Start low-dose steroids**:
	- Hydrocortisone 200 mg/day in a continuous infusion if no response to norepinephrine
- **Achieve early source control**:
	- Use imaging studies as indicated

### Fetal Considerations

- **Consider electronic fetal monitoring** at 24 weeks of pregnancy
- **Consider steroids** for fetal lung maturity after 23 to 24 weeks of pregnancy

####Additional Supportive Measures:

- **Early enteral feeding**
- **Initiate DVT prophylaxis**
- **Avoid hyperglycemia** above 180 mg/dL

## RCOG Recommendations

The RCOG advocates the use of the following care bundle developed by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign for the treatment of sepsis in the obstetric patient. It should be carried out immediately where possible or within 6 hours.

1. **Measure serum lactate levels**.
2. **Obtain blood/swab cultures** before administration of antibiotics.
3. **Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics**.
4. In the event of hypotension and/or lactate >4 mmol/L:
	- Deliver an initial minimum of 20 mL/kg of crystalloid or colloid.
	- Use a vasopressor (e.g., norepinephrine), an inotrope (e.g., dobutamine), or both to maintain mean arterial pressure >65 mm Hg once adequate volume replacement has been achieved.
5. In the event of ongoing hypotension and/or lactate >4 mmol/L:
	- Achieve a central venous pressure of more than 8 mm Hg with further fluid resuscitation.
	- Achieve a central venous oxygen saturation of >75% or mixed venous oxygen saturation of >65%.
