# Obesity

## Considerations for Morbid Obesity

### Early IV Access
- **Analgesia**:
  - Recommend early epidural analgesia.
  - Ensure sufficient length in the space to avoid displacement.
  - Volumes required may be lower due to increased epidural space pressure and high adipose content.
- **Drugs**:
  - Calculate maximum doses of local anaesthetic based on ideal body weight.
  - Avoid respiratory depressants due to risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
  - No need to reduce dose of spinal local anaesthetics.
  - Use desflurane or sevoflurane for shorter recovery times.
- **Anaesthesia**:
  - Ideally combined spinal-epidural (CSE).
  - Positioning: Use a ramp for general anaesthesia (GA).
  - Check table weight limit.
- **Monitors**:
  - Use correct-sized BP cuff.
  - May require arterial line (A-line).

# Preterm Labour

## Preterm Labour
- Occurs between 20 to 37 weeks.

### Tocolytics
- **β2 agonist (terbutaline)**:
  - *Maternal side effects*: tachycardia, arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, mild hypotension, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, and rarely, pulmonary edema.
  - Residual effects may complicate general anaesthesia. Use ketamine, ephedrine, and isoflurane cautiously.
  - May interfere with uterine contraction following delivery.
- **MgSO4**:
  - Potentiates muscle relaxants.
  - May predispose to hypotension secondary to vasodilation.
- **Calcium channel blockers (nifedipine)** and **prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors**.

# Chorioamnionitis

## Chorioamnionitis
- **Signs**: fever (>38°C), maternal and fetal tachycardia, uterine tenderness, and foul-smelling or purulent amniotic fluid. WCC >15.
- In the absence of overt signs of septicemia, thrombocytopenia, or coagulopathy, regional anaesthesia is not contraindicated.

# Indications for Cesarean Section (C/S)

- Initiate fluid therapy (up to 30 ml/kg of crystalloid initially) to maintain MAP >65 mm Hg (lower values may be acceptable in pregnancy; individualize).

## Treatment Pathways
1. **Norepinephrine Administration**:
  - Start norepinephrine through central line if MAP <65 mm Hg and evidence of hypoperfusion.
  - Start low-dose steroids (hydrocortisone 200 mg/day in a continuous infusion) if no response to norepinephrine.
  - Achieve early source control (use imaging studies as indicated).

2. **Fetal Monitoring and Steroids**:
  - Consider electronic fetal monitoring at 24 weeks of pregnancy.
  - Consider steroids for fetal lung maturity after 23 to 24 weeks of pregnancy.

3. **Other Interventions**:
  - Early enteral feeding.
  - Initiate DVT prophylaxis.
  - Avoid hyperglycemia above 180 mg/dL.

# Multiple Gestation

## Considerations for Multiple Gestation (Twins)
- Considerations of pregnancy, full stomach, 3 patients.
- **Increased Maternal Complications**:
  - Increased aorto-caval compression.
  - Increased desaturation.
  - Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).
  - Preterm labor.
  - Prolonged labor.
  - Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia.
  - Placental abruption.
  - Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
  - Operative delivery.
  - Uterine atony.
  - Antepartum and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).
- **Increased Fetal Complications**:
  - Preterm delivery.
  - Congenital anomalies.
  - Polyhydramnios.
  - Cord entanglement.
  - Umbilical cord prolapse.
  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).
  - Twin-to-twin transfusion.
  - Malpresentation.
  - Increased mortality.

### Anaesthetic Management
- **Trial of Labour & Vaginal Delivery** (if both twins have vertex presentation):
  - Ensure very good epidural and 2 large bore IVs.
  - Ensure OR and personnel ready for stat GA at any time, especially for delivery of twin B.
  - Have nitroglycerine available for uterine relaxation if needed for internal version and breech extraction of twin B.
- **Cesarean Section** (more common scenario):
  - Ensure 2 large bore IVs and active cross match.
  - Epidural, spinal, and GA are all safe for cesarean section.
  - Aortocaval compression and rapid desaturation are exaggerated.
  - Have nitroglycerine ready for uterine relaxation.
  - Be prepared for postpartum hemorrhage, need for resuscitation, and uterotonics.
  - Neonatal resuscitation team must be present.

# Peripartum Cardiomyopathy

## Background
- Definition: new heart failure developing in the last month of pregnancy or within the first 5 months postpartum.
- Echocardiogram findings: global dilation and dysfunction, strict criteria for EF ≤ 45%.

### Anaesthetic Considerations
- High-risk cardiac patient with very high risk of maternal/fetal morbidity and mortality.
- Management at a cardiac center in a multidisciplinary team setting.
- Management of cardiac medications and possible anticoagulation.

### Anaesthetic Management
- Detailed review of functional capacity, echocardiogram, cardiology consults, and medications.
- Epidural, spinal, and GA are acceptable if goals are met.
- Neuraxial may be contraindicated if patient is anticoagulated.
- Set up OR for vasopressors, inotropes.
- Manage in a tertiary cardiac center with invasive monitoring (arterial line, ± CVP/PAC) + TEE capability.
- Post-op ICU care.

### Outcome
- 15-50% mortality (higher if cardiomegaly persists in CXR).
- Mortality due to: arrhythmias (sudden cardiac death), embolic events, myocardial infarction (MI).
- At 6 months post delivery:
  - 1/3 resolved.
  - 1/3 unchanged.
  - 1/3 worsened.

# Cervical Cerclage

## Introduction
- Patients with cervical incompetence present for modified Shirodkar or McDonald suture, both done transvaginally at 14-18 weeks.
- These procedures increase fetus survival from 20% to 89%.
- Patients present with painless, recurrent second-trimester miscarriages.
- For patients with bulging membranes, there is concern about rupturing the membranes during the procedure.

### Considerations
- Pregnancy considerations: difficult intubation, aspiration, decreased time to desaturation, aortocaval compression, two patients.
- Risk of membrane rupture and degree of cervical dilation may dictate mode of anaesthesia.
- Potential need for uterine relaxation and avoidance of coughing, straining, position changes that provoke bulging and rupture of membranes.

### Management
- Depends on degree of cervical dilation with options of spinal, epidural, or GA for transvaginal cerclage.
- **If no cervical dilation**:
  - Typically spinal (or epidural) anaesthesia requiring a T10 to S4 block.
- **If cervical dilation present**:
  - Goals: produce adequate analgesia, prevent increase in intrauterine/intraabdominal pressure.
  - Type of anaesthesia depends on presence of bulging membranes and need for uterine relaxation:
	- **Spinal**:
	  - Risk of sitting position and lumbar spine flexion

 leading to bulging of membranes, rupture, and fetal death.

	  - Consider placing spinal/epidural in lateral position.

	  - Dose: 7.5 mg isobaric bupivacaine with fentanyl 15 mcg; alternative is 40 mg lidocaine.

	- **Epidural**:

	  - Midlumbar, 2% lidocaine with 5 mcg/mL epinephrine (10-15 mL total volume) with 100 mcg fentanyl for T8 block.

	- **General**:

	  - Indicated if bulging membranes to facilitate uterine relaxation with volatile anaesthetics.

	  - Risks: coughing, bucking, vomiting leading to rupture of membranes; avoid GA in second trimester due to risks to fetus and parturient.

### Removal of Cervical Cerclage
- Removed at 37-38 weeks; earlier if rupture of membranes or labor begins.
- McDonald cerclage suture removal requires no anaesthesia.
- Shirodkar suture removal requires anaesthesia due to suture epithelialization; options are spinal or epidural.
- Highly epithelialized sutures may require cesarean section.
- If epidural catheter placed, consider leaving it as labor may ensue within a few hours.

# Myasthenia Gravis

## Labour Analgesia
- Epidural (avoids systemic opioids).
- Use very dilute local anaesthetic + dilute opioids for pain control.

## Instrumented Delivery
- May be needed for second stage due to weakness. Neuraxial analgesia can help with pain management.

## Cesarean Section
- Patients with bulbar or respiratory compromise may not tolerate high level of block required for cesarean section; GA may be necessary.

# EXIT Procedure

## Ex-utero Intrapartum Procedure (EXIT)

### Indications
- Mass obstructing the upper airway.
- Congenital high airway obstruction syndrome (CHAOS): examples include laryngeal web, tracheal atresia.
  - Characteristics: enlarged lungs, dilated distal airways, everted diaphragm, ascites, and hydrops fetalis.
- Thoracic abnormalities (tumours and hydrothorax).

### Anaesthesia

#### Summary
- Warm theatre.
- Risk of major blood loss (ensure adequate IV access and blood on standby).
- Use tocolytics: volatile agents, salbutamol, magnesium, calcium channel blockers, GTN.
- Vasopressors for BP.
- NSAIDs and ketamine contraindicated.

#### Temperature
- Warm theatre to avoid evaporative heat and fluid loss.

#### Blood and Blood Products
- At risk for peripartum hemorrhage due to the need to keep the uterus relaxed intra-op.
- Cross-match blood.

#### Drugs
- Use volatiles to keep uterus relaxed.
- Other tocolytics include magnesium, beta agonists (salbutamol), calcium antagonists, GTN.

#### Airway
- Difficult; requires GA.

#### Positioning
- Left lateral wedge.

#### IV Access
- Two wide-bore drips.

#### Cardiovascular
- Use vasopressors to maintain BP.

#### Postoperative Care
- High care for both mother and baby.

#### Monitoring
- Arterial line.
- Central venous pressure (CVP).

#### Analgesia
- NSAIDs contraindicated.
- Ketamine causes uterine contraction.
- Analgesia to the fetus via mother.
