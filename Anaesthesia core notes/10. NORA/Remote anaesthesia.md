- Provision for post-anaesthesia care with appropriate transport to the postanaesthesia care unit.

## Location

### Distance from Main Operating Suite
- Procedures requiring specialized equipment are often located far from the main operating suite.
- Senior or skilled assistance is not readily available.
- Rooms are designed primarily for the interventionalist, not considering anaesthesiologist needs.

### Ergonomics and Space Constraints
- NORA sites may lack pipeline gases, adequate suction, and sufficient electrical outlets.
- Use of portable equipment like gas cylinders and suction devices.
- Limited space due to bulky surgical equipment (e.g., C-arm fluoroscopy units, endoscopy carts).
- Restricted space for anaesthetic machine, drug trolley, and other necessary equipment.

## Staff

### Support Staff
- Inexperienced staff in remote locations unfamiliar with anaesthesia needs.
- Communication issues due to the unfamiliar environment.

### Operators
- Operators are typically medical interventionalists rather than surgeons.
- Lack of established communication between anaesthesiologists and proceduralists in NORA settings.
- Proceduralists may not fully understand anaesthetic requirements, leading to communication hurdles.

## Procedure

### Specialized and Bulky Equipment
- Procedures often require specialized, rapidly evolving technologies.
- Bulky interventional equipment limits access to patients and anaesthetic equipment.
- Risk of equipment disconnection during adjustments.

### Environmental Challenges
- Constant, often cold, temperature required to protect sensitive equipment.
- Procedures may be performed in darkened rooms, limiting visibility and medication safety.
- Use of contrast media can cause hypersensitivity reactions and contrast-induced nephropathy.
- Unplanned procedures can complicate anaesthetic planning.
- High turnover times with truncated pre-procedural evaluations and inadequate fasting or premedication.
- Some procedures require muscle paralysis.
- Limited post-procedure recovery facilities and staff unfamiliar with general anaesthesia recovery.

## Patient

### Assessment and Instructions
- Day case assessments, fasting status, and comorbidities.
- Pre-procedural instructions regarding fasting, consent forms, medication management, and MRI safety.

## Other Considerations

### Radiation and Personal Safety
- Radiation exposure risks and difficulties in patient monitoring.
- Lead aprons limit mobility and access.
- Video monitoring can have limitations, such as blind spots and poor lighting.

# NORA

## Introduction
- Non-operating room anesthesia (NORA) refers to the provision of anesthesia care outside the traditional operating theatre.
- 157% growth over a 10-year period from 2005-2015.
- Increased morbidity related to hypoventilation, hypoxemia, and hypothermia during NORA. Severity of injury and overall mortality also increased during NORA procedures. The majority of cases were attributed to inadequate oxygenation/ventilation, often preventable by better, more vigilant monitoring. These hazards in NORA are largely attributable to the inherent challenges.

## Goals of Non-Operating Room Anesthesia (NORA)

- **Proceduralist**: Skill in immobilizing the patient, learning curve with new technology.
- **Anesthesia team**: Clear plan, no complications, patient safety.
- **Nursing & Technicians**: Coordination and support.
- **Administration**: Budget and resource management.

**Main Goal: Safe, Smooth & Efficient Patient Care**
- The primary goal is to ensure patient safety while optimizing the procedure and patient comfort and physiology.
- Other goals:
  - Controlling anxiety, minimizing psychological trauma, controlling movement for procedural safety, and ensuring safe discharge post-procedure.
- A multidisciplinary approach is essential, involving hospital administration, proceduralists, trainees, nursing staff, ancillary staff, with the anesthesiologist playing a central role.
- Checklists must be used.

Patients using ≤5 mg a day of prednisone equivalent for ≤3 weeks have a low risk of adrenal suppression. >5-20 mg per day of prednisone equivalent for >3 weeks may cause adrenal suppression. >20 mg/d for ≥3 weeks will cause adrenal suppression that may continue for a year after cessation. |
| **Insulin**                                                                    | Administer 1/3 to 1/2 the dose the evening or morning of the procedure depending on the frequency of dosing. Hold short-acting insulin. If insulin pump, continue lowest basal nighttime rate. Measure blood glucose the morning of the procedure. These patients should be scheduled as the first morning cases.                    |
| **Opioid and pain medications**                                                | Take the normal morning dose before the procedure. Hold nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications 48 hours before the procedure.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Oral antiglycemic medications**                                              | Hold on the day of surgery. Hold metformin on the day of surgery; the risk of lactic acidosis is most prominent in renal or hepatic failure.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Herbal medication and supplements**                                          | Hold for 7-14 days before the procedure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Monitoring
- The ASA Standards for Basic Anesthetic Monitoring dictate identical monitoring standards in the operating room and NORA locations:
	- Monitor oxygenation, ventilation, circulation, and temperature continually.
	- Measure the inspired concentration of oxygen for general anaesthesia.
	- Use pulse oximetry for all anaesthetics.
	- Employ end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement for general anaesthesia and with appropriate adapters/modification for sedation cases.
	- Continuously use ECG and measure blood pressure every 5 min for circulatory evaluation.
	- Measure temperature when body temperature changes may occur.

### Anaesthesia Technique in NORA
- The ideal sedation-analgesia technique for NORA should:
	- Alleviate patient anxiety and discomfort.
	- Provide pain relief.
	- Prevent patient movement.
	- Maintain a high safety profile.
	- Facilitate rapid onset and predictable offset for speedier recovery and discharge.

#### Commonly Used Sedatives and Analgesics for NORA

| **Ketamine**        | <1 min          | 45 min                | 10-20 min                   | Effective adjunct with minimal respiratory depression but can cause hallucinations, tachycardia, and increased secretions.                                    |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | 10-15 min       | Up to 3 hours         | 30-40 min                   | Can cause hypotension, bradycardia, and delayed recovery and discharge home.                                                                                  |
| **Midazolam**       | 1-2 min         | 2.5 hours             | 25-35 min                   | Caution with concomitant use of other sedatives due to the risk of respiratory depression.                                                                    |
| **Remimazolam**     | 3 min           | 35-50 min             | 5-8 min                     | Ultrashort-acting with non-organ dependent metabolism but expensive.                                                                                          |
| **Etomidate**       | 1 min           | 3 hours               | 10-20min                    | Hemodynamically neutral but can cause nausea, myoclonus, and potential adrenal suppression; not typically used for infusions.                                 |
| **Fentanyl**        | 1-3 min         | 2-4 hours             | 20-25 min                   | Inexpensive, predictable pharmacokinetics, but potential for respiratory depression, especially in combination with other sedatives.                          |
| **Oliceridine**     | <5 min          | 1.3-3 hours           | Not available               | Lower opioid-related adverse effects.                                                                                                                         |

- Due to the continuum of anaesthesia depth, individuals administering moderate sedation should be able to rescue patients who enter deep sedation.

#### Continuum of Anesthesia According to the ASA

|                             | Minimal Sedation (Anxiolysis)         | Moderate Sedation/Analgesia ("Conscious Sedation")   | Deep Sedation/Analgesia                                       | General Anesthesia                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Responsiveness**          | Normal response to verbal stimulation | Purposeful response to verbal or tactile stimulation | Purposeful response following repeated or painful stimulation | Unarousable even with painful stimulus |
| **Airway**                  | Unaffected                            | No intervention required                             | Intervention may be required                                  | Intervention often required            |
| **Spontaneous Ventilation** | Unaffected                            | Adequate                                             | May be inadequate                                             | Frequently inadequate                  |
| **Cardiovascular Function** | Unaffected                            | Usually maintained                                   | Usually maintained                                            | May be impaired                        |

### Medication Errors
- Medication errors fall into five categories:
	- Incorrect dose
	- Omission
	- Substitution
	- Repetition
	- Insertion
- Mechanisms of error include:
	- Inadequate communication
	- Incorrect patient weight
	- Non-observance of institutional guidelines
	- Poor supervision
	- Poor or no labelling
	- Miscalculation of dose
- Limiting risk:
	- Use of barcoding for medication identification.
	- Use prefilled or pharmacy-prepared syringes and infusions.
	- Ensure a ‘just culture’ so near misses and actual errors are reported without fear of punishment.

### Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN) Risk

#### GFR > 60 mL/min
- **Normal or near-normal renal function**
- **Risk of CIN**:

 Low

- **Recommendations**: No follow-up or prophylaxis required
#### GFR 45-59 mL/min
- **Risk of CIN**: Low (without risk factors)
	- **Recommendations**: No specific prophylaxis or follow-up required
- **Risk of CIN**: Increased (if intra-arterial contrast is administered)
	- **Recommendations**: Preventative measures recommended
#### GFR less than 45 mL/min
- **Risk of CIN**: Moderate
	- **Recommendations**: Preventative measures recommended

### CIN Prevention Strategies

#### IV Hydration
- **Inpatients**:
	- **Protocol**: 0.9% saline solution at 1 mL/kg/h for 12 hours before and after the procedure.
- **Outpatients**:
	- **Protocol**: Isotonic saline or sodium bicarbonate solution at 3 mL/kg/h for a minimum of 1 hour before and 6 hours after the procedure as a reasonable abbreviated alternative.

#### N-acetylcysteine
- **Efficacy**: Inconclusive results but often used due to low cost and lack of major adverse effects.

#### Additional Measures
- Discontinue nephrotoxic medications 8 hours before contrast administration.
- Avoid dehydration.
- Avoid high osmolar contrast.
- Dialysis patients do not require fluid hydration before contrast administration.

#### NORA Challenges
- Medication availability in NORA settings is often limited.
- Challenges in preparation and administration of medication (distance from patient/dimmed lighting).
- Procedures in NORA sites may require medications unfamiliar to the anaesthesiologist.
- Space constraints may force nonstandard medication cart placement, restricting timely access.
- Pharmacy location may be far from the NORA site.

##### Recommendations for NORA
- A standardized list of anaesthesia medications should be available wherever anaesthesia or sedation is undertaken. Medications for rare situations, such as dantrolene for malignant hyperthermia or intralipid for local anaesthetic toxicity, should be immediately available in a designated area.
- The Joint Commission national patient safety goals stipulate that medication must be labelled immediately with the drug name, concentration, and expiry.
- Standardized colors for different drug classes have been widely adopted to reduce “syringe switch errors.”
# NORA by Specific Locations

## Non-Operating Room Anesthetizing Sites

- **Radiology:**
	- Interventional
	- MRI
	- Computed tomography
	- Ultrasound
	- Radiation oncology
- **Gastroenterology**
- **Cardiac Interventions:**
	- Electrophysiology
	- Catheterization
	- Interventional cardiology
	- Transesophageal echocardiography
- **Lithotripsy**
- **Electroconvulsive therapy sites**
- **Emergency room**
- **Intensive care units**
- **Obstetric labor and delivery**
- **Hospital wards**

## Endoscopy

- **Procedures**:
	- Gastroenterology endoscopy
	- Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
- **Challenges**:
	- **Shared Airway**:
		- Endoscope can cause external compression, leading to upper airway compromise.
		- Local anaesthetic in the oropharynx abolishes the gag reflex, increasing aspiration risk.
	- **Positioning**:
		- ERCP may require pronation, limiting airway access and altering respiratory mechanics.
		- Risk of positional injuries.
	- **Conduct of Anaesthesia**:
		- Varies widely; patient condition and procedure specifics determine technique.
		- Sedation is common; secure airway decisions must be assessed.
		- Monitoring ventilation with a non-secured airway is crucial; capnography is imperative.
		- Starvation guidelines may be blurred due to bowel prep.
	- **Complications**:
		- Rapid recognition and management of GI bleeds.
		- Development of complication-specific protocols.
	- **Patient Population**:
		- Typically elderly, frail, with multiple comorbidities.

## Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory

- **Patient Population**:
	- Ranges from critically ill neonates to critically ill geriatrics.
	- Compromised cardiopulmonary reserve prone to hemodynamic instability.
- **Challenges**:
	- Risk of arrhythmias due to myocardial stimulation by catheters; readiness for cardioversion.
	- Routine heparin administration increases bleeding risk.
	- Larger diameter interventional catheters increase risk of vascular injury and cardiac perforation; crossmatched blood products should be available.
	- Patient positioning with hands above chest risks brachial plexus injury.
	- Anaesthesiologist may need to provide echocardiographic support and monitor for complications.
	- Patients with congenital heart disease may have associated anatomical anomalies, including difficult airway.
	- Hypothermia, radiation safety, use of contrast, and room ergonomics are relevant considerations.

## MRI

- **Challenges**:
	- **Ferromagnetic Pull**:
		- Potential for injury to patients and healthcare providers.
		- Rigorous checklist for ferrometallic objects before entering the magnet area.
		- Ferromagnetic equipment can become lethal projectiles near the magnetic field.
	- **Electromagnetic Interference**:
		- Interference with medical equipment, including standard monitoring devices and fluid medication pumps.
		- Use of extension tubing or MRI-compatible pumps.
	- **Patient Accessibility**:
		- Distance from anaesthesiologist complicates management, monitoring, and emergency interventions.
		- Resuscitative attempts should occur outside the scanner.
	- **Auditory Considerations**:
		- MRI operation produces loud noise, distressing to patients and interfering with auditory monitoring alarms.

## Pediatric NORA

- **Safety Considerations**:
	- Medication safety, radiation safety, hypothermia, contrast risks, and airway compromise.
	- Pre-calculated doses to avoid incorrect dosing.
	- Higher susceptibility to DNA damage due to radiation exposure.
- **Anaesthesia Needs**:
	- Amnesia and immobility for diagnostic cases; rarely analgesia.
	- Use of medications with minimal respiratory drive effect (e.g., ketamine, dexmedetomidine).
	- Propofol infusion titrated for amnesia while maintaining ventilation.

## Considerations for Setting Up Remote Sites

**PP-DD-SSET-CG-F**: A mnemonic for setting up remote sites.

- **Patient**: Suitability criteria, fasting criteria.
- **Post Anaesthetic Care**: PACHU, recovery, Highcares.
- **Drugs**: Stock order, necessary drugs.
- **Disposables**: IV lines, airways, circuits.
- **Sustainability**: Audits, trial runs, M&M.
- **Staff**: Leadership, appropriate training.
- **Equipment**: Monitoring per SASA standards, anaesthetic machines, maintenance.
- **Transfer**: Liaison for patient complications or inappropriateness.
- **Complications**: Protocols (e.g., MH), availability of drugs (e.g., intralipid, dantrolene).
- **Guidelines**: SASA or government guidelines.
- **Finance**: Funding, sustainability.
