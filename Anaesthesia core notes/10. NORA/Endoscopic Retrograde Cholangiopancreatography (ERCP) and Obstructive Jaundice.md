# ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography)

## Conduct of Anaesthesia

### Perioperative Considerations

1. **Remote site:** Ensure preparedness for anaesthesia in a remote or less-equipped environment.
2. **General Anaesthesia (GA) vs. Deep Sedation:** Decision based on patient and procedural factors.
3. **Prone Position:** Necessary for the procedure, consider its impact on anaesthesia management.
4. **Risk of Hypoxaemia:** Pre-oxygenation for 5 minutes recommended to mitigate risks.
5. **Topical Local Anaesthetic (LA):** Improves scope tolerance but can cause loss of gag reflex.
6. **Full Monitoring:** Includes capnography to monitor ventilation.
7. **Drug Interactions and Altered Pharmacokinetics:** Be aware of potential interactions and altered drug effects in the perioperative period.
8. **Postoperative Care:** Monitor for pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and abdominal distention, which may require nasogastric tube (NGT) placement.

### Indications for General Anaesthesia Over Sedation

- **Very young patients**
- **High ASA status (≥3):** Consider operating theatre (OT) setting.
- **High BMI**
- **Gastrointestinal Bleeds**
- **Uncontrolled Reflux**
- **Expected Prolonged Procedures**
- **Previous Failed Procedures**
- **Live Workshops:** Involves unknown surgeons and procedures.
- **Conversion from Sedation:** Due to respiratory obstruction or procedural failure.
- **Duodenal Obstruction**
- **Patient Refusal of Sedation**

### Monitored Anaesthesia Care Vs General Anaesthesia for ERCP: Decision Support Criteria

**Overview:**  
The choice between monitored anaesthesia care (MAC) and general anaesthesia (GA) with tracheal intubation for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) depends on a range of procedural and patient factors. A modified Delphi method was employed to gather expert consensus on these factors. Key considerations include procedural complexity, risk of aspiration, patient comorbidities, and the institution's experience with monitored anaesthesia.

### **Monitored Anaesthesia Care Preferred:**

1. **Procedural Factors:**
	
	- Short procedures allowing for rapid patient recovery (91%)
	- Experienced anaesthesiologists (83%)
	- Diagnostic procedures (83%)
**2**. **Patient Factors:**
		- High risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (100%)****
		- Low ejection fraction, recent myocardial infarction (83%)
		- Low arterial blood pressure (75%)
		- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma (75%)****
		- Elderly patients (ASA ≥3) (67%)

### **General Anaesthesia Preferred:**

1. **Procedural Factors:**
	
	- **High gastrointestinal bleeding risk, abscess drainage** (75%)–ASGE IV classification
	- **Prolonged procedures with risk of hypoventilation, perforation, or increased abdominal pressure** (100%) (e.g., pneumoperitoneum)
	- **Gastric outlet obstruction with risk of aspiration** (100%)–ASGE IV classification
2. **Patient Factors:**
	
	- **Stomach/oesophagus not empty** (91%)
	- **Aspiration risk or procedure conducted in supine position** (91%)
	- **Risk of respiratory failure, pre-existing hypoxia or respiratory failure** (100%)

**Key Considerations:**

- **Institutional experience** with MAC plays a significant role.
- MAC is favoured for haemodynamic instability.
- **GA with tracheal intubation** is recommended in cases of pre-procedural respiratory failure or where prolonged interventions are required.

# Obstructive Jaundice Anaesthesia

## **Anesthetic Management of Obstructive Jaundice**

1. **Selection of Anesthesia:**
   - **Combined general-epidural anesthesia** is considered a viable option for patients with obstructive jaundice, as it offers stable hemodynamics and allows for early extubation. The combination reduces the need for general anesthetics, facilitating quicker recovery and maintaining adequate analgesia postoperatively via an indwelling epidural catheter.

2. **Use of Narcotic Drugs and Muscle Relaxants:**

   - **Muscle Relaxants:**
	 - **Succinylcholine**: Should be avoided due to its ability to excite the vagus nerve, potentially leading to **bradycardia** or **ventricular arrhythmia**.
	 - **Rocuronium bromide**: Neuromuscular blockade may be prolonged in patients with obstructive jaundice, likely due to impaired excretion secondary to bile duct obstruction. Increased levels of free bilirubin may also compete with rocuronium for albumin binding.
	 - **Atracurium and Cisatracurium**: Preferred in jaundiced patients because they are metabolized independently of liver or kidney function. These agents undergo **Hofmann elimination**, meaning they are broken down in plasma and tissues rather than through hepatic or renal processes. They also do not accumulate with repeated dosing, making them ideal for jaundiced patients. Cisatracurium has a higher potency than atracurium (4x), but its metabolite **laudanosine** is much lower, minimizing side effects like **histamine release** and **cardiovascular effects**.
   - **Inhalation Anesthetics:**
	 - **Halothane**: Should be **avoided** because of its **hepatotoxic effects**, which could exacerbate liver dysfunction in patients with obstructive jaundice.
	 - **Enflurane**: Does not have significant adverse effects on liver function and is safe to use in hepatobiliary patients.
	 - **Sevoflurane**: Prolongs recovery time in jaundiced patients, although it does not cause significant damage to renal function, even in patients with cirrhosis.
	 - **Desflurane**: The **MACawake** (minimum alveolar concentration at which patients wake up from anesthesia) is reduced in jaundiced patients, likely due to **hyperbilirubinemia**. The higher the plasma bilirubin levels, the lower the MACawake.
	 - **Isoflurane**: Jaundiced patients exhibit **enhanced sensitivity** to isoflurane, which can lead to **hypotension** and **bradycardia** during induction and maintenance of anesthesia. This is thought to be related to the neurotoxic effects of jaundice and its impact on central nervous system neurotransmitters like **serotonin**.
   - **Intravenous Anesthetics:**
	 - **Propofol**: Both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol remain unchanged in patients with obstructive jaundice. Propofol is safe at **low and intermediate doses**, and it does not seem to exacerbate cardiovascular depression unless used at high doses. It may even offer protective effects on cardiovascular function. Additionally, propofol is less likely to cause postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to inhalation anesthetics.
	 - **Etomidate**: The requirement for etomidate to achieve the desired depth of anesthesia is reduced in patients with obstructive jaundice, making it an effective choice for patients with compromised liver function.

3. **Opioid Analgesics:**
   - In obstructive jaundice, the required dosage of opioid analgesics can be **reduced by approximately 50%**, likely due to the **increased release of endogenous enkephalins** secondary to cholestasis. This also results in a higher **pain threshold** in jaundiced patients, as demonstrated in studies where electrical pain thresholds were significantly elevated.
   - **Morphine**: The postoperative dose of morphine can also be reduced by 50%. However, opioids, including morphine, can cause **spasm of the biliary sphincter** and an increase in bile duct pressure, with this effect lasting for approximately 2 hours.

4. **Fluid Management:**
   - **Stroke Volume Variation (SVV)** and **Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV)** are valuable tools for predicting fluid responsiveness in patients with obstructive jaundice during surgery. These dynamic measurements are superior to traditional static indices like **mean arterial pressure (MAP)**, **central venous pressure (CVP)**, and **cardiac index (CI)**, which are less accurate in predicting volume responsiveness.
   - Maintaining adequate fluid balance is crucial in jaundiced patients to avoid complications such as **hemodynamic instability**, **cardiopulmonary complications**, and **interstitial edema**. Additionally, extracorporeal volume depletion, common in jaundice, necessitates careful perioperative fluid management.

## **Postoperative Management of Obstructive Jaundice**

1. **Capacity Management:**
   - Postoperatively, patients with obstructive jaundice require **adequate fluid management** to maintain **urine output**. In cases where urine output is insufficient, **furosemide** or **mannitol** can be considered to support diuresis and prevent renal complications. Monitoring fluid intake and output, as well as renal function and electrolytes, is essential.

2. **Analgesia:**
   - Adequate analgesia is a priority postoperatively, but **NSAIDs should be avoided** due to the risk of renal impairment. Instead, **small doses of opioid analgesics** should be used to manage pain, keeping in mind the reduced need for opioids in jaundiced patients

## **Preoperative Considerations**

1. **Risk Factors:**
   - **Hematocrit <30%**, **indirect bilirubin >200 μmol/L**, and **malignancy** are key factors that negatively influence prognosis in obstructive jaundice. Preoperative management includes correcting coagulopathy with **vitamin K** (administered intramuscularly, 1-10 mg, 3 days before surgery) and, if necessary, using **fresh frozen plasma**.

2. **Nutritional Support:**
   - Preoperative nutritional support is essential but challenging due to the impaired nutritional status common in obstructive jaundice. Recommendations include a **high-protein, high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet** delivered via the enteral route if possible. In severe cases where enteral feeding is not possible, **parenteral nutrition** may be initiated 5-7 days preoperatively.

3. **Renal Protection:**
   - To protect renal function, **prevention of hypovolemia** is critical, as is avoiding **nephrotoxic drugs** such as aminoglycosides and NSAIDs. Monitoring renal function and early use of **mannitol** (5%-10%) may help to support renal health.
