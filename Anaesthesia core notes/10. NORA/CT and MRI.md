# General Points

## Indications for Anaesthesia
- **Infants and Uncooperative Children**:
	- Small babies (under 2 months) may sleep through a scan if fed and wrapped well.
	- Older children or adults with psychological, behavioral, or movement disorders.
- **Intubated Patients**:
	- Includes acute trauma victims and patients in intensive care.
- **Interventional Procedures**:
	- Analgesia, sedation, or anaesthesia may be required for procedures under CT or MRI guidance.
- **Elective Scans**:
	- Patients may have a range of issues such as developmental delay, epilepsy, malignancy, and psychiatric and movement disorders.
	- Significant cardiovascular (CVS) and respiratory problems are uncommon but be cautious of syndromes with CVS manifestations.

## General Considerations
- **Choice of Anaesthesia**:
	- Depends on patient needs, investigation nature, and anaesthetist's skills and experience.
- **Anaesthetic Equipment**:
	- Check if machines use piped gases or cylinders; ensure a full spare O₂ cylinder is available if using cylinders.
- **Setup and Planning**:
	- Plan the location of the anaesthetic machine, suction, and monitoring equipment.
	- Induction location may be a tilting trolley with transfer to the scanner after induction.
	- Some configurations may require two anaesthetists for safe management.
- **Recovery Facilities**:
	- Ensure availability of a properly equipped recovery bay with an experienced nurse near the scanner, or arrangements for safe transfer to an operating department recovery room.

# CT-Scan

## Anaesthesia
- **Equipment and Space**:
	- Compact anaesthetic machines and monitors are practical due to limited space.
	- Patient, anaesthetic machine, and monitors must be visible from the control room.
- **Airway Management**:
	- The patient’s head is accessible; an LMA can be used if IPPV or airway protection is not required.
- **Anaesthetic Techniques**:
	- Use techniques that ensure immobility and lack of awareness, determined by available equipment and patient needs.

## Hazards
- **Radiation Exposure**:
	- Monitor the patient from outside the scan room if possible; wear radiation protection if necessary to remain near the patient.
- **Transfers and Movement**:
	- Ensure cannulae, catheters, drains, and ETTs are secure to avoid dislodgement during transfers and scanning.

## Contrast Media
- **Types and Properties**:
	- Modern intravascular contrast media include highly iodinated, non-ionic, water-soluble compounds like iohexol, iopromide, iopamidol, and iodixanol.
	- Concentrations typically range from 300–320 mg of iodine/mL.
- **Administration**:
	- Volume varies by preparation, investigation, age, and body weight, potentially up to 150 mL.
	- Timing of injection may need coordination with the radiographer for dynamic investigations.
	- Contrast is viscous and may be difficult to inject through small cannulae; use the cannula hub for injection.
	- Do not use automated injectors with central venous lines due to high pressure risks.
	- Be aware of the potential for allergic reactions and renal failure, especially in dehydrated or renally impaired patients.
	- Metformin should be avoided 48 hours before and after the scan to prevent lactic acidosis.

### Typical Volumes of Contrast Media for CT Scanning

#### Adult Volume (mL)
- **CT Head**: 50–100
- **CT Body**: 100–150
- **Aortography**: 100
- **Urography**: 2–3 mL/kg

#### Child Volume (mL)
- **CT Head**: 10 plus 2 mL/kg
- **CT Body**: Up to adult dose
- **Aortography**: Not applicable
- **Urography**: 2–3 mL/kg

## Practical Considerations
- **Artifact Prevention**:
	- Route metal-containing objects away from the X-ray beam.
- **Breath-Holds**:
	- Manual ventilation may be necessary for thoracic or abdominal scans to reduce respiratory movement artifacts.
- **Patient Positioning**:
	- Secure the patient's arms above the head for thoracic or abdominal scans using wide adhesive tape.
- **Intensive Care Transfers**:
	- Manage ICU patients like inter-ICU transfers with full monitoring and ventilatory support, ideally supervised by ICU staff.

# MRI

## Introduction

- MRI is a versatile imaging tool free from the dangers of ionizing radiation.
- A computer creates cross-sectional or 3D images from minute radiofrequency signals generated as hydrogen nuclei are flipped in and out of alignment with a powerful magnetic field by high-frequency magnetic pulses.
- Non-invasive but can be unpleasant—the subject has to lie motionless in a narrow, noisy tunnel, with the part of the body to be imaged closely surrounded by an ‘aerial coil’ (a very claustrophobic environment).
- Typical sequence of scans lasts 15–25 minutes, but complex scans may take much longer.
- Up to 3% of adults cannot tolerate scanning without sedation or anaesthesia.
- Provision of safe anaesthesia for MRI requires specialized equipment and careful organization—unlike CT, you cannot simply take a standard machine and monitor to the MRI scanner.

## Hazards

### Common Hazards in the MRI Unit

1. Projectile effect
2. Movement and heating of implantable surgical devices and foreign bodies
3. Effect of metals and other objects on the image quality
4. Thermoregulatory issues: heating and heat loss
5. Monitoring difficulties
6. Minimal patient access
7. MRI chamber pollution by anaesthetic gases
8. Intravenous (IV) contrast agents
9. Noise levels and other physiological effects
10. Quenching of MRI magnets

- Most scanners use a superconducting magnet to generate a high-density static magnetic field, which is always present. Field strength is measured in tesla (T)—most scanners use 0.5–1.5T magnets (about 10,000 times the Earth’s magnetic field).
- Near the scanner (>5mT field strength), the static field exerts a powerful attraction on ferromagnetic materials (e.g., scissors, gas cylinders, laryngoscopes) which can become projectiles. Electric motors (e.g., in syringe drivers) may run erratically, and any information stored on magnetic media (credit cards, cassette tapes, or floppy disks) will be erased. The magnetic field decreases as the distance from the scanner increases—beyond the 0.5mT boundary or outside the scan room can be considered safe.
- Devices (e.g., hypodermic needles) made from non-ferromagnetic stainless steel can be taken into the scan room. If you are unsure about an object, do not risk it!
- Oscillating magnetic fields induce eddy currents in electrical conductors (e.g., ECG leads, metallic implants). These currents may disrupt or damage electronic equipment (including pacemakers) and cause heating effects that can result in burns.
- Large masses of metal (e.g., anaesthetic machines, gas cylinders) near the scanner or small amounts of non-ferrous metals within the 3D volume being scanned can distort the magnetic fields, causing poor-quality images.
- The scan room is usually shielded to prevent external electrical interference from swamping the magnetic resonance signals. All electrical equipment within the scan room must also be fully shielded, and electrical conductors entering the room (e.g., monitoring cables) require special radiofrequency filters.
- Rapidly changing magnetic fields cause mechanical vibrations and extremely loud ‘knocking’ noises, which can potentially damage hearing.

#### 1. Equipment Exposure to Magnetic Fields
   - Ferromagnetic equipment will be attracted to the magnetic field—must at least be classed "MR-safe."
   - Non-ferrous metals can be subject to induced electric current → risk of burns → patient is foam padded.
   - Pacemakers and internal cardioverters are contraindicated unless MR-safe.

#### 2. Human Exposure to Magnetic Fields
   - Fluctuation > 20T.s⁻¹ can cause microshock.

#### 3. Quenching
   - Equipment malfunction causing evaporation of liquid cryogens → burns, frostbite, lung damage, asphyxiation → quench pipes for adequate venting.

#### 4. Other
   - Claustrophobia → sedation.
   - Noise up to 120 dB → ear guards, loud monitors, and visual alarms.

### Four Categories of Medical Device Showing Compatibility with MRI Scanners

|Category|Description|
|---|---|
|MR-compatible|The equipment can function within the MRI scanner|
|MR-safe|The equipment can enter the MRI scanner but may not function|
|MR-conditional|Advice needs to be sought as to whether the equipment may enter the scanner|
|MR-unsafe|Equipment must not enter the MRI scanner|

#### Definitions
- **MR Safe**: Contains no material that would present a hazard at any field.
- **MR Conditional**: Safe to scan under specified conditions detailed by the manufacturer and based on testing.
- **MR Unsafe**: Presents an unacceptable risk to patients or staff if used within the MR environment.

_The term 'MR compatible' is ambiguous and should no longer be used._

### Safety Checklist
#### Equipment Checklist for Sedation or Anaesthesia in the MRI Suite

- **Anaesthesia drugs**
- **Resuscitation drugs**
- **Defibrillator**
- **A difficult airway trolley containing oropharyngeal and nasal airways, laryngeal mask airways, ETT of different sizes, bougies and stilettes should be available**
- **Simple positioning equipment, for instance, head rings, shoulder rolls, etc.**
- **Infusion pumps with the extension tubing**
- **Warming devices - the temperature in the radiology suites is often cool as their equipment requires low temperature for its maintenance. For prolonged procedures, patients may become hypothermic and warming devices will have to be brought from the operating theatres**
- **Lead aprons, thyroid collars, and dosimeters need to be worn in the radiology suites to reduce and monitor the exposure to radiation**

## Practical Considerations

### Items to Avoid in MRI

1. Cochlear implants
2. Intra-ocular foreign bodies
3. Arterial or aneurysm clips–depending on specification
4. Cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators
5. Spinal cord stimulators and other central nervous stimulators
6. Implanted dental magnet keepers
7. Pulmonary artery catheters and other indwelling cardiac monitoring catheters
8. Other electronic devices not for medical purposes (e.g., cell phones)

### Considerations Summary

- **Remote site anaesthesia**
- **Cool room/Hypothermia**
- **Noise** (ear protection—even if asleep)
- **Helium escape** - MRI contains Helium liquid kept cooled. If the MRI is shut down in is "quenched" and expands into a gas which is vented outside. If venting gets blocked then a hypoxic environment can occur.

#### Magnet
- **Equipment**
  - Safe/conditional/unsafe
  - Long lines (e.g., capnography or to infusion pumps if equipment not MRI compatible = Delay or risk of disconnection)
- **Patients/Staff**
  - Contraindications:
	- Intraocular foreign bodies
	- Ferromagnetic neurovascular surgical clips
	- Implanted surgical devices (cochlear implants, cardiac pacemakers, implanted defibrillators)

### Equipment

- A typical iMRI suite comprises an inner controlled area in which projectile hazards exist (i.e., 30 G) and a larger MR-controlled area where hazards exist in relation to implanted devices (i.e., 5 G), and to which physical access is controlled with self-locking doors/entry cards.
- The presence of a large multidisciplinary team in the iMRI suite highlights the need for compulsory safety induction and training courses, and defined patterns of workflow.
- During surgery, an MRI responsible person, usually a senior radiographer, controls the flow of staff and equipment through the environment. If the operating table is located within the 5 G area, all surgical instruments should be MR safe, that is, non-ferrous, and this has enormous cost implications.
- An alternative arrangement is to locate the operating table outside the 5 G line, facilitating the use of the full range of surgical instrumentation, with efficient transfer into the magnet to obtain diagnostic-quality images at any point during the procedure.
- **To avoid such incidents, nobody (patient or staff) should pass the 5 G contour without first undergoing an MR safety check for implantable devices and other contraindications.**
- Although implanted programmable devices are typically a contraindication to having an MRI scan, some patients may be scanned under strictly controlled conditions in specialist centres.
- Anaesthesia should be induced in a dedicated anaesthetic room adjacent to the MRI scanner but outside the 5 G contour. This provides an area in which standard anaesthetic and resuscitation equipment can be stored and used.
- The location of the anaesthetic room should be such that anaesthetized patients can be easily and rapidly transferred into the scanner and rapidly retrieved in an emergency.
- Patients should be transferred into the scanning room on an MRI-safe non-ferrous trolley.

### Two Alternative Approaches

#### 1. Specialized ‘MRI-compatible’ Equipment within the Scan Room
#### 2. Conventional Equipment Outside the Scanner’s Magnetic Field in the Control Room

- A typical set-up is as follows:
  - Induction area adjacent to, but outside, the scan room (beyond the 0.5mT boundary), equipped with a compact conventional anaesthetic machine and monitoring.
  - Piped gases, scavenging, and suction in both the induction area and control room.
  - Non-magnetic tipping trolley for patient transfer into the scanner.
  - Compact (e.g., wall-mounted) anaesthetic machine and ventilator in the control room with a 10m coaxial (Bain) breathing system.
  - Respiratory gas/agent side-stream analyser with capnograph display fitted with an extended sampling tube (increases the response time by 5–10s).
  - MRI-compatible pulse oximeter (fibreoptic patient

 probe and shielded cable).

  - ECG with MRI-compatible (carbon fibre) patient leads and electrodes.
  - NIBP machine with an extended hose, non-metallic connectors, and a range of cuffs.
  - Recent technology allows a monitor unit within the scan room, with a slave unit in the control room, improving patient monitoring during transfers.
  - Equipment may be MRI-conditional, which must not be taken beyond the 5mT line, or MRI-safe, which can be taken right into the scanner.

### Practical Considerations and Techniques

- Physically and ‘magnetically’ restricted access makes patient observation and treatment difficult, so a secure airway is a priority.
- Neonates and young babies (<2 months)—will often sleep through a short scan, if fed, wrapped up, and placed on their side in the scanner.
- Babies and small children (<15kg), and any patient with an intracranial space-occupying lesion, suspicion of raised ICP, or needing a protected airway—use intubation and IPPV.
- Larger children and adults (if no risk of raised ICP)—use SV and a standard LMA (not a flexible one with a wire spiral).
- If intubating a patient for a head scan, use an RAE tube—it keeps the connectors and breathing system clear of the head coil.
- Tape the valve on the pilot tube of a cuffed ETT or LMA outside the aerial coil, or the metal of the spring will distort the images.
- Be careful with MRI-conditional equipment (e.g., ICU ventilator, monitor unit).
  - Do not place it on the moving table, as it might be moved inside the 5mT line, at which point it will be strongly attracted to the magnet.
  - Similarly, be aware of the position of all MRI-conditional equipment.
- Sedation with oral or IV benzodiazepines may be used by radiologists for healthy, but claustrophobic, adults. Patients with severe back or root compression pain may also require strong analgesia to tolerate positioning for a scan.
  - The role of sedation for MRI scanning in children is unclear.
  - Some children’s centres have reported successes with structured sedation programmes run by dedicated sedationists. However, the safety of having heavily sedated children in the medical imaging department without direct anaesthetic supervision has been questioned.

## Intravenous (IV) Contrast Agents

IV contrast agents may also be administered, and the most common are chelates of gadolinium, which alter the relaxation rates of hydrogen nuclei. These can occasionally cause mild side-effects, including nausea, vomiting, and pain on injection, and there is a recognized, albeit low, incidence of anaphylactoid reactions. However, gadolinium-based contrast agents have been implicated in causing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with impaired renal function. It is usual to assess renal function by measuring an estimated glomerular filtration rate in all patients receiving gadolinium. Although all commercially available linear chelates of gadolinium have been reported to cause NSF, the majority of cases are related to gadodiamide. There is also an increased incidence of NSF in patients with concurrent liver disease.

### Tips for Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation Through a 10m Breathing System

- Use a system that functions as a ‘T-piece’ (Mapleson D or E), so dead space is unaffected by the length.
- Ayre’s T-piece and coaxial Bain systems work well and are both suitable for ventilating babies and small children.
- Airway pressures measured near the ventilator may not accurately represent distal pressures at the ETT.
- VT delivered to the lungs will be reduced by ‘compression losses’ of the gas within the system and by expansion of the tubing during inspiration, making it difficult to compensate for significant leaks around uncuffed ETTs—change to a slightly larger tube, so the leak is minimal.
- As a result of these effects, IPPV using a simple pressure generator (e.g., Penlon Nuffield 200 with a Newton valve) may not be effective in children weighing >15kg.
- Increased expiratory resistance of some long systems (e.g., Ayre’s T-piece) generates a positive expiratory pressure which increases with the FGF.

### Intensive Care Patients

- Same considerations apply as for CT scanning, but potential hazards are greater, so the risk/benefit balance should be assessed carefully.
- Do not scan patients who are haemodynamically or otherwise unstable.
- Electronic pressure transducers, metal-containing ICP ‘bolts’, temporary pacing wires, and conventional ECG leads must be removed before the patient enters the scan room.
- Full checks (and, if necessary, plain radiographs) must be performed to confirm there are no hazardous metallic implants or foreign bodies present.
- Patients who are stable on inotrope infusions can be scanned, but infusion pumps must remain at a safe distance from the magnet—ideally outside the scan room. Prepare duplicate pumps in the control room, with extended infusion lines threaded with the breathing system into the scan room. Connect the patient to the running infusions, while outside the room; check they are stable, then move into the scanner.

### Patient and Staff Safety

- To avoid accidental injury, all patients having an MRI scan must complete a screening/consent form. In cases of children or sedated ICU patients, these must be completed on their behalf by relatives or staff.
- To prevent injury and property damage, all staff must similarly complete a screening questionnaire and leave metallic objects, pagers, credit cards, etc. outside the room.
- Greatest dangers arise from ferromagnetic implants and foreign bodies—certain types of artificial heart valves, old cerebral aneurysm clips, steel splinters in the eye, where movement could disrupt valve function or precipitate intracranial or vitreous haemorrhage, respectively.
- Patients and staff with cardiac pacemakers must remain outside the 0.5mT boundary.
- Anaesthetized and sedated patients should have their ears protected to prevent noise-induced auditory damage.
- IV MRI contrast media are paramagnetic but do not contain iodine, and have a narrow therapeutic index.
  - Side effects include headache, nausea and vomiting, local burning, and wheals (2.4%). Severe hypotension/anaphylactoid reactions are rare (~1:100,000).
  - Commonly used agents are gadopentetic acid (Magnevist™) at a dose of 0.2–0.4mL/kg and gadodiamide (Omniscan™) at 0.2mL/kg.
  - More recently, gadobutrol (Gadovist™) at 0.1mL/kg and gadoteric acid (Dotarem™) at 0.2mL/kg have been used in patients with a reduced GFR or an unknown GFR (most children). These agents are associated with a lower risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.

### Cardiac Arrest

- Do not attempt Also in the scan room.
- Do not allow the cardiac arrest team into the scan room.
- Start basic life support (BLS) with non-metallic, self-inflating bag and chest compressions.
- Remove the patient from the scan room on a non-magnetic trolley, and continue resuscitation outside the 0.5mT boundary.
