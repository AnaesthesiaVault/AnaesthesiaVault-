# Anaesthesia for Interventional Radiology

In this subspecialty, minimally invasive procedures are performed under image guidance, usually in the X-ray department. These procedures are often performed to avoid open surgical procedures to reduce post-procedure pain and recovery time. They may be diagnostic or therapeutic. The imaging utilized may involve radiation exposure, e.g., fluoroscopy and CT, or may be ultrasound or MRI.

## Common Interventional Procedures
- **Angioplasty/stenting/coiling:** Vascular, neuro, and cardiac.
- **Embolizations:** Blocking vessels to reduce bleeding in a planned surgical operation, stop bleeding post-surgically following trauma, or stop tumour growth.
- **Chemo-embolization:** Combination of delivering cancer treatment directly to a tumour and then blocking its blood supply.
- **RFA:** Local destruction of tissue by heating.
- **Cryoablation:** Local destruction of tissue by freezing.
- **Thrombolysis.**
- **Biopsies.**
- **Vertebroplasty/cementoplasty:** Injection of cement into bone to reduce pain in tumours and fractures.

## Indications for Anaesthesia
- The patient may be required to be very still for long periods.
- The procedure may be very painful.
- Paediatric patients.

## General Points
- It is vital for the anaesthetist and their assistant to familiarize themselves with the equipment available in this ‘isolated’ environment.
- Monitoring and the anaesthetic machine must be fully checked, and the location of the resuscitation equipment confirmed.
- Scavenging is often not possible, so TIVA may be useful or an Aldasorber may be used.
- Depending on the patient and procedure, you may be in or outside the scan room.
- Induction generally occurs within the radiology suite.
- Before starting, ensure all drugs anticipated for anaesthesia and emergencies (metaraminol, ephedrine, atropine) are drawn up.
- After the procedure, the patient is woken up in radiology and then generally transferred to the main theatre recovery. The procedure table usually does not tilt, so it is recommended to induce anaesthesia on an anaesthetic trolley and transfer the patient after induction.

### Complications
- **Vascular perforation/haemorrhage:**
  - Management: Reverse heparin, consider BP lowering (beta blockers/propofol), reduce ICP (if raised) via hyperventilation and osmotic diuresis.
- **Vascular occlusion:** Secondary to emboli, thrombosis, vasospasm, or arterial dissection.
  - Management: Raise MAP & remove hardware.
- **Air embolism:** (open-ended catheter) - avoid N₂O.
- **Contrast-related:**
  - Allergic reactions.
  - Hyperosmolar nephropathy.

## Summary
**Environment:** Remote, equipment not regularly used—check, small space, cool room (maintain normothermia).
**Positioning:** Strap head carefully into extension head of bed. Ensure gantry cannot catch on anaesthetic tubing.
**Anticoagulation:** Heparin to reduce thrombotic complications, ACT x2 baseline.
**Fluid:** Requirements low (constant infusions down intervention catheters & contrast is hyperosmolar).
**CVS stability:** Tricky due to low stimulation.
**Choice of anaesthesia:** Awake with sedation vs GA (most use GA due to immobilization of the patient).
**Maintenance:** Sevo has a slight recovery benefit over propofol TIVA.
**NMBA:** Any movement is dangerous.
**Emergence:** Rapid to assess neurology but don’t compromise haemodynamics.
**Recovery:** HC or ICU.
**Complications:** Transfer to theatre if fails or complicates.
**Safety and radiation:** Anaesthetists have high exposure due to scatter.
- Protection = Max distance from radiation source, limit exposure, appropriate radiation protection.

# Aneurysm and Coiling
## Introduction
- Berry aneurysms occur at vessel junctions, cerebral arteries having a weaker, less elastic muscle layer than systemic vessels.
- Associations: Atherosclerosis, polycystic kidneys, hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, coarctation of the aorta, Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos, and Klinefelter’s syndromes.
- Common sites: Internal carotid system (41%), anterior cerebral artery (34%), middle cerebral artery (20%).
- More common in females and individuals aged 40–60 years.
- Aneurysms do not usually rupture until they are >5mm in diameter.
- Classic symptoms: Sudden onset of severe headache with loss of consciousness, which may be transient in mild cases.
- Mortality: ~20% die from SAH at the time of the initial bleed. Of those who survive to reach hospital, 15% will die within 24 hours, and 40% will make a good recovery.

### World Federation of Neurosurgeons Grading of Subarachnoid Haemorrhage

| **Grade** | **GCS** | **Motor Deficit** |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| 1         | 15      | -                 |
| 2         | 13–14   | -                 |
| 3         | 13–14   | +                 |
| 4         | 7–12    | ±                 |
| >5        | 3–6     | ±                 |

## Considerations

### Equipment
- Angiography suites often have older equipment; additional care is needed to check anaesthetic equipment.

### Temperature Control
- Fluoroscopy suites are cool due to computer hardware; measures must be taken to maintain normothermia in patients.

### Positioning
- Neurointervention requires the gantry of the image intensifier to move around the patient's head. Ensure the patient's head is carefully placed to avoid snagging or displacement by the intensifier.

### Anti-coagulation
- Heparin is frequently used to limit thrombotic complications with highly selective catheters. ACT is typically targeted close to twice baseline and usually allowed to reverse spontaneously at the end of the procedure.

### Fluid Load
- Fluid requirements are low due to heparinised crystalloid infusions and high osmotic load of contrast.
- Post-op fluids are required to maintain normovolaemia; avoid glucose-containing solutions in diabetics to prevent hyperglycaemia (target blood glucose: 7.1-8.5 mmol/L).

### Low Stimulation and Rapid Recovery
- Anaesthesia must maintain immobility for imaging, with minimal stimulation. Blood pressure maintenance is critical, especially post-SAH vasospasm. Rapid recovery is necessary for neurologic assessment.

### Road Mapping
- Utilizes radiocontrast media injection to guide advancing catheter. Any head movement makes the procedure difficult and dangerous.

### Recovery
- ICU admission is common post-procedure. Patients must be recovered locally until safe to transport to ICU or must be accompanied by a doctor. Standard recovery facilities and trained staff are necessary for patients returning to a normal hospital ward.

### Transfer to Theatre
- Direct transfer to the operating theatre is indicated for procedural complications or failed INR followed by open surgery. Prior planning for consent, staffing, and equipment is essential.

### Unfamiliar/Remote Environment
- Limited help and specialized tools, prolonged patient transfers, limited access to the patient, and the need for absolute immobility (muscle relaxant or remifentanil infusion).

### Unsecured Aneurysm
- Risk of rupture necessitates avoiding increased transmural pressure. Hemodynamic control may require hypotension or sinus pause for coil placement. External pacing/defibrillator pads should be placed.

### Staff Safety and Radiation
- Protect staff from radiation by maximizing distance from the source, limiting exposure time, and utilizing adequate radiation protection (lead aprons and thyroid shields).

### Complications

#### Neurological
##### Rebleeding
- High mortality, especially within the first 24 hours. Management includes BP control with titratable agents and, if necessary, tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid for short-term therapy.

##### Vascular Perforation/Haemorrhage
- Presents as an obvious blush on angiography or catheter outside the vessel. Management includes reversing heparin with protamine and maintaining low arterial blood pressure.

##### Delayed Neurological Deficit
- Caused by vasospasm, major cause of morbidity and the second main cause of mortality. Peaks 3–14 days post-initial bleed. Treatment includes CCB (Nimodipine) and hypertensive, hypervolaemic therapy.

##### Hydrocephalus
- Obstruction of CSF drainage may result in hydrocephalus and raised ICP. Sudden reduction in pressure with a ventricular drain may increase rebleeding risk. Hydrocephalus must be ruled out by CT scan.

##### Seizures

##### Contrast-Induced Nephropathy
- Prevention includes risk stratification, limiting contrast dose, and considering prophylactic use of N-acetyl cysteine.

##### Air Embolism
- Caused by open-ended catheter with a pressurised flush. Avoid nitrous oxide.

#### Medical
- Severe LV dysfunction/cardiogenic shock, ECG abnormalities, neurogenic pulmonary oedema, hyponatremia, DVT, pneumonia, and hepatic, renal, and GI dysfunction.

### Surgical Considerations
- Aneurysms from vertebral or basilar arteries require a posterior fossa craniotomy; others use a frontal or fronto-parietal approach. Control of the aneurysm before clipping is essential. Most intracranial aneurysms are treated with Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs). Recovery should be smooth and rapid.

### Anaesthetic Technique

#### Take-Off
- Intravenous induction, cardiovascular stability, muscle relaxation, endotracheal intubation, ventilation.

#### Monitoring
- Peripheral nerve stim

ulator, arterial pressure, temperature, clotting (ACT).

#### In-Flight
- Inhalational or TIVA, minimal opiates, deep NMB, often heparin. Occasional hypotension, apnoea, or protamine use.

#### Landing
- Awake extubation, cardiovascular control.

### Evidence
- Surveys show preference for general anaesthesia due to eliminating patient movement and perceived safety. Small early recovery benefit of sevoflurane over propofol TIVA.

### Claire Summary
**Pre-op:** Assess deficit, fluids, Nimodipine, Phenytoin, stockings.
**Intra-op:** Standard monitoring + CVC + IBP, avoid BP surges but maintain CPP, normocapnia, normothermia.
**Post-op:** ICU for patients with pre-op deficit/difficult surgery/vasospasm. Paracetamol + Codeine phosphate for analgesia. CT Scan if ↓GCS.

### Anaesthetic Techniques
- Choice of technique (awake, MAC/sedation, general anaesthesia) based on institutional experience and individual preference. Randomised studies suggest early recovery benefit of sevoflurane over propofol TIVA.

## Essentials No Matter What Technique is Chosen
- **Hypotension:** Avoid systolic pressure <140mmHg.
- **Control of Ventilation:** Maintain normocapnia.

## Types of Anaesthesia
- **Awake**
- **MAC/Sedation**
- **General Anaesthesia**
