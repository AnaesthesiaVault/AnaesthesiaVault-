# Summary of Cystic Fibrosis and Anaesthesia

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311160544.png)

## Pathogenesis

[Cystic fibrosis](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Cystic-Fibrosis/) is caused by a mutation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7. This mutation leads to the dysfunction of the CFTR protein, a transmembrane chloride ion channel found in exocrine tissue, resulting in impaired chloride ion transport.

### Mutation of CFTR Gene
- **Gene**: CFTR gene on chromosome 7
- **Effect**: Dysfunction of CFTR protein, leading to defective chloride ion transport

### Effects on Sweat Glands
- **Normal Function**: Reabsorption of chloride ions (Cl⁻) by CFTR proteins
- **With Mutation**: Decreased reabsorption, increased Cl⁻ secretion in sweat
- **Outcome**: Elevated sweat chloride concentration

### Effects on Epithelial Tissue
- **Function**: CFTR proteins facilitate Cl⁻ diffusion into secretions
- **With Mutation**:
  - Reduced Cl⁻ diffusion into peri-ciliary fluid, altering water composition
  - Decreased mucociliary clearance
- **Outcome**: Accumulation of secretions, obstructing secretory passages

### Specific Organ Systems

#### Lower Respiratory Tract
- **Symptoms**: Chronic productive cough
- **Signs**:
  - Lung hyperinflation (on x-ray)
  - Abnormal pulmonary function tests
- **Complications**:
  - Retained secretions leading to bacterial proliferation, airway infection, and inflammation
  - Chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis (primary cause of death in CF)

#### Upper Respiratory Tract
- **Condition**: Chronic sinusitis
- **Signs**: Nasal polyps
- **Cause**: Retained secretions in sinuses, leading to bacterial proliferation

#### Pancreas
- **Condition**: Pancreatic insufficiency
- **Mechanism**: Pancreas cannot secrete digestive enzymes, leading to degradation of pancreatic tissue
- **Complications**:
  - Fat and protein malabsorption causing failure to thrive
  - Decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (e.g., Vitamin D) causing osteoporosis
  - Inflammation leading to scarring, fatty infiltration, and islet cell destruction, causing Type II Diabetes Mellitus

#### Gastrointestinal Tract
- **Symptoms**: Decreased intestinal motility
- **Complications**:
  - Distal ileal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in children/adults
  - Meconium ileus in newborns
  - Prolonged neonatal jaundice due to retained meconium and increased bilirubin reabsorption

#### Biliary Tree
- **Complications**: Delayed bile passage causing inflammatory hepatic response, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension

#### Was Deferens
- **Effect in Utero**: Degeneration of was deferens and Wolffian ducts
- **Outcome**: Infertility in males

### Additional Notes
- **Inheritance Pattern**: Autosomal recessive
- **CFTR Gene Mutations**: Over 1700 identified, with ΔF508 mutation in ~67% of Caucasians
- **Diagnosis**: Based on increased sweat chloride concentration, CFTR mutations, and symptoms affecting ≥1 organ system

### Pathophysiology
- **CFTR Mutation**: Causes abnormal transmembrane Cl⁻ transport in exocrine tissue, resulting in viscous secretions

### Mechanism

#### Early Life
1. **Bronchial Secretion Accumulation**: From birth, secretions accumulate in bronchial lumen, delaying mucociliary clearance
2. **Obstruction**: Mucus plugs obstruct bronchial lumen, trapping air in lungs

#### Progression
3. **Lung Hyperinflation**:
   - Diaphragm domes below 10th posterior rib and 6th anterior rib on PA CXR
   - Flattened hemidiaphragm, enlarged retrosternal space on lateral CXR
   - Collapsed alveoli appear more solid and radiodense
   - Adjacent structures may shift towards atelectasis on CXR
4. **Air Trapping**: Pulmonary capillaries absorb gases in alveoli distal to obstruction, leading to alveolar collapse (Atelectasis)

### Imaging

## Clinical Findings

### Inflammatory Response
- **Early Years**: Retained bronchial secretions serve as nidus for recurrent bacterial colonization and infection
- **Late Findings**: Secretion accumulation blocks inhaled air to affected lung segments, causing chronic hypoxia
- **Inflammatory Response**: Leads to bronchial and peribronchial destruction
- **Fluid Leakage**: Into bronchial walls and peribronchial regions
- **Destruction of Elastic Components**: Of bronchi by inflammatory cytokines
- **Accumulation of Inflammatory Exudate**: In bronchi

### Hypoxia and Pulmonary Hypertension
- **Hypoxia**: Induces pulmonary capillary vasoconstriction
- **Pulmonary Artery Hypertension**: Blood backs up in pulmonary arteries, causing right ventricular dilation
- **Blood Dilation**: Of pulmonary arteries
- **Underventilated Lung Segments**: Appear as lower intensity on imaging

### Imaging Indicators
- **Collapsed Alveoli**: Appear white on X-ray
- **Peribronchial Cuffing**: Edematous bronchi appear ring-like
- **Tramlines**: Bronchus wider than corresponding blood vessel
- **Signet Ring Sign**: Bronchus wider than corresponding blood vessel
- **Bronchiectatic Cavities**: Dilated, thickened, untapered bronchi
- **Mucoid Impaction**: Mucus-filled bronchi form tubular opacities
- **Pulmonary Arteries**: Appear wider on X-ray
- **Right Ventricle Enlargement**: On imaging
- **Mosaic Changes

### Summary
- **CFTR Mutation**: Leads to abnormal transmembrane Cl⁻ transport and viscous secretions
- **Secretions**: Accumulate, obstruct, and lead to lung hyperinflation and atelectasis
- **Inflammatory Response**: Causes bronchial destruction and chronic hypoxia
- **Pulmonary Hypertension**: Results from capillary vasoconstriction and blood backing up in pulmonary arteries
- **Key Imaging Findings**: Atelectasis, peribronchial cuffing, tramlines, signet ring sign, bronchiectatic cavities, mucoid impaction, pulmonary artery widening, right ventricle enlargement, and mosaic changes on CT

## Cystic Fibrosis and Anaesthesia

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by thick secretions and ciliary dysfunction involving the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, resulting in malabsorption syndromes, pneumonia, wheezing, and bronchiectasis.

### Considerations
- High risk for perioperative pulmonary complications
- **Pathophysiologic Sequelae**:
  - Pulmonary: Mucous plugging, chronic pneumonia, bronchiectasis, hemoptysis, bronchospasm, pneumothorax, mixed restrictive & obstructive lung physiology, bullous disease, hypoxemia/hypercarbia
  - Cardiovascular: Pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale
- **Extra-pulmonary Disease**:
  - Anemia of chronic disease
  - GERD, sinusitis
  - Hepatic: Abnormal transaminases, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, coagulopathy
  - Pancreatic insufficiency & diabetes
  - Chronic malnutrition, cachexia, deconditioning
- **CF-related Medications**: Oxygen, bronchodilators, mucolytics, antibiotics, steroids, insulin, pancreatic enzymes

### Goals & Conflicts
- Preoperative optimization in collaboration with respiratory medicine
- Avoidance of general anaesthesia (GA) if feasible
- **Intraoperative Management Principles**:
  - Lung protective ventilation
  - Aggressive pulmonary toilet, bronchodilation, hydration
  - Avoid prolonged ventilation
  - Multimodal analgesia with limited sedating analgesics
  - Avoid exacerbation of pulmonary hypertension
- Postoperative high acuity setting with aggressive respiratory therapy
- Verify normal coagulation parameters prior to neuraxial/regional anaesthesia

### Preoperative Management
- Intense physiotherapy and use of BiPAP machine (if available)
- Nebulize drugs as late as possible
- CXR, ABG, and spirometry
- FBC, U+E, LFTs, coagulation, BSL
- ECG, Echo (assess for cor pulmonale), raised JVP, enlarged liver, peripheral oedema
- Check for cyanosis and assess saturations
- Signs of liver disease
- Previous surgeries (transplants, ERCP, etc.)

### Intraoperative Management
- Use arterial line (A-line)
- Avoid nasal intubation (due to polyps)
- Short-acting agents and opioid-sparing techniques to minimize respiratory depression
- Caution with muscle relaxation (some patients rely on muscle tone for airway patency)
- Regional anaesthesia (consider altered coagulation due to malabsorption)
- Careful positioning (cachectic patients)
- Aim for early extubation (trial extubation even if predictors of postoperative ventilation are present)
- Postoperative care in PACU/ICU

#### Predictors of Postoperative Ventilation
- FEV1 <61% predicted (<1L in adults)
- PaO2 <9.3kPa (RA)
- PaCO2 >6.6kPa

### Pregnancy
- Very high-risk patient with increased risk of low birth weight babies and pre-term delivery

#### Vaginal Delivery
- Ensure monitored setting, consider invasive monitoring if significant cardiorespiratory dysfunction
- Epidural is an excellent choice to reduce hyperventilation and stress, but titrate carefully to T10 to prevent respiratory muscle weakness

#### Cesarean Delivery
- Epidural preferred with careful titration to avoid high block
- GA is acceptable but remember goals:
  - Prevent perioperative bronchospasm
  - Frequent suctioning for pulmonary toilet
  - Appropriate ventilatory settings to avoid air trapping/pneumothorax
  - Post-op monitoring in HAU/ICU, chest physiotherapy, pulmonary optimization
  - Use NIPPV to treat respiratory failure
