# Drugs
## Warfarin

### Indications
- Prophylaxis of systemic thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation (AF), rheumatic valve disease, prosthetic valves.
- Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
### Mechanism of Action (MOA)
- **Inhibits Vitamin K Epoxide Reductase**: Prevents recycling of oxidized vitamin K to its reduced form.
- **γ-Carboxylation**: Inhibits activation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X in the liver.
### Onset of Action (OOA)
- Circulating factors unaffected → Peak effect in 48-72 hours.
### Adverse Effects (AEs)
- Hemorrhage
- Teratogenicity (especially in the first trimester)
### Interactions
**Potentiated By:**
- **Coagulation-affecting Drugs**: NSAIDs, Heparin.
- **Plasma Binding Competition**: NSAIDs.
- **Metabolism Inhibition**: Cimetidine, alcohol, allopurinol, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, TCAs.
- **Vitamin K Absorption Interference**: Cholestyramine.
**Antagonized By:**
- **Hepatic Enzyme Induction**: Barbiturates, rifampicin, carbamazepine.
### Monitoring
- **INR (International Normalized Ratio)**: Target INR: 2.0 to 4.5 depending on the indication.
### Bridging
- **Delay Resumption**: Until adequate haemostasis is achieved.
  - **Major Surgery**: LMWH/UFH. Reinitiate 48-72h post-op.
  - **Minor Surgery**: LMWH/UFH. Reinitiate 24h post-op.
  - **Warfarin**: Can resume same day as heparin; discontinue heparin when INR is therapeutic.
### Reversal
1. **Stop Warfarin**
2. **Vitamin K₁**: 0.5-5mg oral (24h) or IV (6-8h) for clotting factor activation.
3. **PCC (Prothrombin Complex Concentrate)**: Replaces clotting factors in 15 minutes.
4. **FFP (Fresh Frozen Plasma)**: Replaces clotting factors in 1-4 hours.
### Procoagulant Effect
#### Mechanism

- **Vitamin K-Dependent Clotting Factors:** Warfarin inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X) by inhibiting the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. This enzyme is essential for recycling vitamin K, which is necessary for the carboxylation and activation of these clotting factors.
	
- **Protein C and Protein S:** Warfarin also inhibits the synthesis of natural anticoagulants, Protein C and Protein S, which are also vitamin K-dependent. Protein C, when activated (as activated protein C or APC), degrades Factors Va and VIIIa, reducing thrombin formation and clot propagation. Protein S acts as a cofactor for activated Protein C.

#### Initial Procoagulant Effect

- **Short Half-Life of Protein C:** Protein C has a shorter half-life (6-8 hours) compared to clotting factors like Factor II (prothrombin), which has a half-life of approximately 60-72 hours. As a result, the levels of Protein C decrease more rapidly after warfarin initiation.
	
- **Temporary Hypercoagulable State:** The rapid decline in Protein C levels, without an immediate corresponding decrease in the levels of clotting factors, creates a temporary hypercoagulable state. This procoagulant effect is particularly significant in the early days of warfarin therapy, before the full anticoagulant effect is achieved.

#### Clinical Implications

- **Risk of Thrombosis:** The initial procoagulant state can increase the risk of thrombosis, especially in patients with pre-existing hypercoagulable conditions.
	
- **Bridging Therapy:** To mitigate this risk, warfarin is often started alongside a fast-acting parenteral anticoagulant like heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) until therapeutic INR (International Normalized Ratio) is achieved and the clotting factors are sufficiently reduced.
## Heparins

![](Pasted%20image%2020240301131935.png)

**Antithrombin III**: Normally deactivates thrombin (by forming inactive complexes) and factor Xa.
### Types

**a) Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)**:
- Promotes the formation of inactive antithrombin-thrombin complexes by 1000-fold.
- Inhibits factor Xa at low doses, and factors IXa, XIa, and XIIa at higher doses.

**b) Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)** (e.g., enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin):
- Preferentially inhibits factor Xa much more than forming inactive complexes.

**c) Fondaparinux**:
- Selectively inhibits factor Xa.
- No effect on inactive complex formation.
#### Risk Factors and Prevention for Spinal Hematoma with LMWH
- Female sex, advancing age, renal insufficiency, spinal stenosis/ankylosing spondylitis, traumatic placement, indwelling epidural catheter, epidural–spinal, immediate preoperative (or intraoperative) drug administration, twice daily drug dosing, and concurrent antiplatelet or anticoagulation medications.
- Patients receiving a prophylactic dose of LMWH (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg SC QD) should have a delay of 12 hours prior to neuraxial anesthesia and prior to epidural catheter removal. A delay of 24 hours is required for those patients receiving higher therapeutic doses (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg BID or 1.5 mg/kg QD)
- Indwelling catheters should be removed prior to initiation of LMWH thromboprophylaxis. In the postoperative period following neuraxial anesthesia, some patients, however, will require continued dosing. The first dose of postoperative LMWH may be administered 12 hours later for single daily prophylactic dosing, 24 hours later for therapeutic dosing, and 48–72 hours later after high bleeding risk surgery. Indwelling catheters should be removed 2 hours prior to the first dose. The administration of LMWH should be delayed for at least 4 hours following catheter removal.
## Oral Anticoagulants

(a) Direct thrombin inhibitors (Dabigatran)

(b) Direct Factor Xa inhibitors (Rivaroxaban, Apixaban)

(c) Anti-Vitamin K (Warfarin)

### DOAC Coagulation Tests

| **DOAC**                               | **Likely Rules in Drug Effect** | **Rule out Drug Effect (Best Test)**           |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), Apixaban (Eliquis), Edoxaban (Lixiana) | ↑ INR                           | Anti-Xa Level within normal limits             |
| Dabigatran (Pradaxa)                   | ↑ PTT                           | DTT (Dilute Thrombin Time) within normal limits |

**Summary:**
- For Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, and Edoxaban: An increased INR suggests the drug effect, while a normal Anti-Xa level can rule it out.
- For Dabigatran: An increased PTT suggests the drug effect, while a normal DTT can rule it out.
### Summary of DOAC Perioperative Management (Stopping and Restarting treatment)
**1. Elective surgery**
- Low bleeding risk surgery: 24h; 48h in renal impairment
- High: 48h-72h; 72h in renal impairment, 96h for dabigatran
**2. Restart** 1 day after low risk bleeding surgery and 2 days after high risk (PAUSE trial)  
**3. Emergency Surgery**
- Delay when possible to until levels fall
- Avoid neuraxial if anticoagulant effect cannot be ruled out
- TXA to ↓ surgical bleeding
- Consider specific reversal agent / PCC
### Benefits and Weaknesses of Warfarin Compared with DOACs

**Advantages:**

- Wide range of indications
- Preferred in high-risk patients (e.g., mechanical valves)
- Long safety history
- Cheap, widely available antidote
- Easy monitoring of anticoagulation
- No gastrointestinal upset (compared to DOACs like dabigatran/rivaroxaban)
- Inexpensive
- Single daily dose

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires regular monitoring
- Highly variable dosing
- Increased need for bridging
- Food and drug interactions
- Initially procoagulant
- Slow onset of action
- Long half-life
- Increased risk of intracranial bleed (50%)
- Possibly increased risk of life-threatening bleed (25%)
### Management of Patients with Acute Hip Fracture: Spinal Anaesthesia and DOACs

##### Thrombin Inhibitors (Dabigatran)

- Schedule for afternoon surgery the day after the last dose.
- Measure thrombin time at 08:00 on the day of surgery.
	- **Normal Thrombin Time**: Proceed with surgery.
	- **Prolonged Thrombin Time**: Contact hematologist; consider reversal with idarucizumab.

##### Factor Xa Inhibitors (Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Edoxaban)

- **CrCl ≥ 30 ml/min**: Proceed 24 hours after the last dose.
- **CrCl < 30 ml/min**: Measure anti-factor Xa levels and consult with a hematologist before proceeding or delay surgery.

## Protamine Sulphate

**i) MOA:** Prepared from fish sperm → negatively charged protein forms an inactive complex with Heparin that is cleared by the reticulo-endothelial system

**ii) Dose:** 1mg Protamine reverses 100 iu Heparin

**iii) AE's:** Histamine release → allergy → hypotension, dyspnea, bradycardia; flushing; pulmonary hypertension; anticoagulant at high doses

**iv) Alternatives:** Platelet Factor 4, Heparinase

**v) Heparin Rebound:** After protamine-reversal, heparin can still be released from protein binding sites

# Bridging

## Device Placement (e.g., Pacemaker, Defibrillator)
- **High Risk**: Bridging compared to continuing anticoagulation increases bleeding risk.
## All Other Surgery
- **Bridging Recommendations**:
  - **High Risk**: Likely benefit.
  - **Moderate Risk**: Uncertain.
  - **Low Risk**: Probably no benefit, increased bleeding risk.

**Consideration**: Weigh bleeding risk from surgery against thromboembolism risk.
## Risk Stratification for Perioperative Thromboembolic Events

| Risk Category | Mechanical Heart Valve                            | Atrial Fibrillation                    | VTE                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **High**      | Any mitral valve prosthesis, recent stroke/TIA    | CHADS₂ score of 5-6, recent stroke/TIA | Recent (within 3 months) VTE  |
| **Moderate**  | Bileaflet aortic valve with AF or risk factors    | CHADS₂ score of 3-4                    | VTE within past 3-12 months   |
| **Low**       | Bileaflet aortic valve without AF or risk factors | CHADS₂ score of 0-2                    | Single VTE >12 months earlier |

**Other High Risk**: Anterior wall MI.

**BRIDGE Trial**:
- **Findings**: In patients with AF (intermediate/low thrombotic risk), no inferiority without bridging; higher bleeding risk with bridging (bridging = LMWH)
### "HAS-BLED" Score for Assessing Bleeding Risk in Anticoagulation

- **H**: Hypertension
- **A**: Abnormal renal/liver function
- **S**: Stroke
- **B**: Bleeding history/predisposition
- **L**: Labile INR
- **E**: Elderly
- **D**: Drugs/alcohol

**Score Interpretation**:

- >3: High bleeding risk.
## Anticoagulation in Patients with Previous HIT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia)
- **Short-term Heparin Use**: Potentially safe in emergencies.
- **Alternative Anticoagulants**: Preferred.
- **Bivalirudin**: Considered for PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention).
### Example Regimen for Previous HIT

- **Initial**: Bivalirudin.
- **Follow-up**: Alternative anticoagulants as per clinical guidelines.
### Example Regimen for Bridging

### DOACs (According to PAUSE Trial)
- **Low Bleeding Risk Surgery**:
  - 24 hours prior (48 hours if renal impairment).
- **High Bleeding Risk Surgery**:
  - 48-72 hours prior (72 hours if renal impairment, 96 hours for dabigatran).
## Management of DOAC Bleeding

### Major Bleeding

2. Administer TXA.
3. Specific reversal agents:
   - Andexanet for rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban.
   - Idarucizumab for dabigatran.
   - Ciraparantag for all DOACs.
4. Consider prothrombin complex concentrate.

   - Drug-specific test if available.
   - TEG / ROTEM.
### Non-Major Bleeding
1. Delay next dose or discontinue.
2. Administer TXA.
# Anticoagulation Management in Cardiac Surgery

## Perioperative Management Recommendations of DOAC
1. Monitoring levels helpful in emergencies, unclear history, or organ dysfunction.
2. Routine monitoring not recommended.
3. Normal PT / aPTT excludes elevated levels of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban (not apixaban).
4. Normal TT excludes elevated dabigatran levels.
5. Precise DOAC levels: Anti-FXa levels for rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban; dilute thrombin time and ecarin clotting time for dabigatran.
6. Reversal agents:
   - Andexanet for rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban.
   - Idarucizumab for dabigatran.
   - Ciraparantag for all DOACs.
7. Non-specific measures to reduce bleeding.
8. Stoppage, resumption, and bridging strategies for DOACs in cardiac surgery.
### DOAC Management in Cardiac Surgery
#### Stopping DOACs

- **General Rule**: Stop 2 days before cardiac surgery (moderateto high-risk procedures by definition).
#### Resuming DOACs

- Resume 6-12 hours after removal of chest drains.
#### Bridging

- **Short-term Pre-op**: Safe without heparin bridging if DOAC levels are therapeutic.
- Ensure DOAC levels are ≤ 30 ng/mL if bridging.
- **Post-op**: Bridging to LMWH/UFH may be reasonable until removal of chest drains.
#### Monitoting

- **DOAC Levels**: ≤ 30 ng/mL in renal/liver impairment.
- **Heparin-Calibrated Anti-Xa Levels**: < 0.1 IU/mL if DOAC levels cannot be tested.
## Management of DOAC-Associated Bleeding in Cardiac Surgery

# Anticoagulation Management in Obstetric Surgery

## SOAP Guidelines for Perioperative Management
### General

**Ante-Partum**
1. Outpatient MDT consult at 36 weeks.
2. Thromboprophylactic regimens to facilitate neuraxial procedures, e.g., converting LMWH to LD-UFH 5000U SC BD.
3. Withholding LMWH when necessary.
4. Flagging patients on admission.
5. Check platelet counts for patients on UFH > 4 days before neuraxial procedures to rule out HIT.

**Intra-Partum**
- Withhold anticoagulants on admission for delivery and seek obstetric advice.

**Post-Partum**
- Plan resumption of anticoagulation after delivery.
### Prosthetic Valves

1. Stop warfarin at 36 weeks and switch to dose-adjusted SC-LMWH or UFH infusion.
2. Last dose 24 hours before planned delivery at 38 weeks.
3. Bridge to dose-adjusted IV-UFH or prophylactic dose LMWH.
4. Serial anti-Xa levels (0.2-0.5) for safe vaginal or cesarean delivery.
5. Recommence IV-UFH or anti-Xa-guided SC-LMWH 6 hours post uncomplicated delivery.
6. Reintroduce warfarin on day 5-7.
### Unscheduled

**Stop All Anticoagulants**

1. **Warfarin**
   - Haemosolvex or FFP to target INR of 2.0.
   - Small doses of Vitamin K orally or IV.

2. **Therapeutic LMWH**
   - Protamine reversal: 1mg protamine per 1mg Clexane given in the last 8 hours.

3. **IV-UFH**
   - Coagulation normalizes within 1-2 hours after stopping.
   - Protamine if required (MOH risk): 1mg per 100 units given over the last 2-3 hours (max 50mg).
# Anticoagulation Management in Regional Procedures

## Hemorrhagic Complications and Peripheral Nerve Blocks (PNBs)

- There is limited objective information available on the frequency and outcomes of hemorrhagic complications following PNBs.
- According to the 2021 ASRA guidelines, an analysis of 32 case reports of severe hemorrhagic complications post-PNBs revealed the following trends:
	- Patients with neurological deficits completely recovered within 12 months.
	- Patients who required hospitalization due to complications had prolonged hospital stays.
	- Complications in anticoagulated patients were more often due to blood loss rather than neurological damage.
	- Deep plexus blocks (e.g., lumbar plexus block) and deep peripheral blocks (e.g., proximal sciatic nerve block) were associated with a higher risk of complications.
	- There was frequently no evidence of vessel trauma.

### Conclusion

- Anticoagulated patients receiving perineuraxial, deep plexus, or deep peripheral nerve blocks should be managed as if undergoing neuraxial anesthesia.
- Clinical discretion is necessary for determining the safety of other regional anesthesia techniques, such as superficial plexus and nerve blocks.
- Considerations should include the vascularity and compressibility of the anatomical site and potential bleeding consequences.
- The risks of discontinuing anticoagulation therapy should be weighed against the benefits of neuraxial and nerve block anesthesia and analgesia.

## ASRA Guidelines

- The ASRA guidelines recommend treating patients undergoing perineuraxial, deep plexus, or deep peripheral blocks who are on anticoagulants as if they are undergoing central neuraxial blocks (CNB).
- For other regional anesthesia techniques, the decision to perform a block should consider the vascularity and compressibility of the anatomical site and the potential consequences of bleeding.

## AOA Guidelines

- The AoA guidelines align with similar principles and provide specific risk assessments for various blocks:
	- **High-risk:** Paravertebral blocks (including paravertebral, deep cervical plexus, and lumbar plexus blocks).
	- **Deep blocks:** e.g., supraclavicular brachial plexus block.
	- **Superficial perivascular blocks:** e.g., popliteal sciatic block.
	- **Fascial blocks:** e.g., transverse abdominis plane block.
	- **Superficial blocks:** e.g., forearm nerve blocks and ankle blocks.
- The AoA guidelines also highlight:
	- Higher risks associated with catheter techniques and catheter removal.
	- The potential for ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia to enhance safety in patients with abnormal coagulation.
# Anticoagulation Management in Neuraxial

## American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) Guidelines for Neuraxial Anaesthesia in a Patient Receiving Thromboprophylaxis

### Antiplatelet Medications

- **NSAIDs**: No contraindication.
- **Discontinue ticlopidine**: 14 days.
- **Discontinue clopidogrel**: 5-7 days.
- **Discontinue GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors**: 8-48 hours in advance.

### UFH (Subcut)

- No contraindication with twice-daily dosing.
- For total daily dose <10,000 U, consider delaying heparin until after the block if technical difficulty is anticipated.
- Safety of neuraxial blockade with doses >10,000 U UFH daily, or more than twice-daily dosing of UFH, has not been established.

### UFH (IV)

- **Heparinize**: 1 hour after neuraxial technique.
- **Remove catheter**: 2-4 hours after last heparin dose.
- No mandatory delay if traumatic.

### Low Molecular Weight Heparin

- **Twice-daily dosing**:
	- LMWH 24 hours after surgery, regardless of technique.
	- Remove neuraxial catheter 2 hours before first LMWH dose.
- **Single-daily dosing**:
	- Neuraxial technique 10-12 hours after LMWH.
	- Next dose 4 hours after needle or catheter placement.
- **Therapeutic dose**: Delay block for 24 hours.
- **If traumatic**: Delay first LMWH 24 hours after neuraxial technique.

### Warfarin

- Normal INR (before neuraxial technique).
- Remove catheter when INR ≤ 1.5 (initiation of therapy).

### Fondaparinux

- Single injection, atraumatic needle placement or alternate thromboprophylaxis.
- Avoid indwelling catheters.

### Direct Thrombin Inhibitors

- Insufficient information.
- Suggest avoidance of neuraxial techniques.

### Thrombolytics

- Absolute contraindication.

### Herbal Therapy

- No evidence for mandatory discontinuation before neuraxial technique.
- Be aware of potential drug interactions.

# Emergency Surgery and Anticoagulation (DOAC)

**Patient Receiving Direct Oral Anticoagulants Requires Emergency Surgery**

1. **Stop Oral Anticoagulant** & any antiplatelets and parenteral anticoagulants
2. **Contact** Haematologist, Anaesthetist & Surgeon
## Assess Coagulation Status

- **Request:**
	1. Coagulation screen to include aPTT, PT (and TT if available)
	2. Full Blood Count
	3. Renal function (eGFR) (Important: document time of last dose of anticoagulant)

## Coagulation Results Interpretation

- **aPTT, PT (and TT) prolonged:**
	
	- Anticoagulant effect **may be present**
		
		**Management:**
		
		- Consider charcoal if ingestion <2-3 hours (if Surgeon and Anaesthetist agree)
		- Maintain BP and Urine Output
		- Manage any active bleeding
	- **Decision on Surgery:**
		
		- **Delay Surgery** (if possible) for at least 12-24 hours since the last dose
			- **Yes:**
				
				- Refer to protocol for Elective Surgery
				- Risk of bleeding dependent on:
					- Time since last anticoagulant dose
					- Type of surgery
					- Renal function/eGFR (dabigatran clearance is reduced in renal impairment)
			- **No:**
				
				- Immediate Surgery
					- Discuss with Haematologists need for haemostatic agent peri/post operatively
					- Prothrombin Complex Concentrate Beriplex 30-50 units/kg and dose may be repeated depending on timing of last anticoagulant dose and type of procedure
- **aPTT, PT (and TT) normal:**
	
	- Anticoagulant effect **unlikely present**
	- Safe to proceed with surgery

# DVT Prophylaxis

## Antiplatelet (Aspirin)
- Can be used with mechanical prophylaxis for hip/knee surgeries (controversial)
- Not recommended for general surgeries

## Low-Dose Unfractionated Heparin (LD-UFH)
- Dosage: 5000 units subcutaneously tds (cancer surgeries) or bd (orthopedic surgeries)
- No renal dose adjustment required
- Superseded by other agents offering daily dosing

## Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH)
- Used for medical, orthopedic, and non-orthopedic surgeries
- Reduced dosing in renal impairment
- Increased dosing for high BMI/bariatric surgeries

## Danaparoid (Heparinoid)
- Indicated only in Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)

## Direct Thrombin Inhibitors (Dabigatran)
- Used for total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR)
- Inferior to enoxaparin according to the RE-MOBILIZE trial

## Factor Xa Inhibitors (Fondaparinux, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban)
- Used when LD-UFH and LMWH are contraindicated

## Warfarin
- Used only for major orthopedic surgeries
- Not recommended for non-orthopedic surgeries or medical prophylaxis
- NICE recommends starting approximately 6 hours post-surgery with mechanical prophylaxis until mobilizing
- Can be continued orally up to 35 days depending on risk
