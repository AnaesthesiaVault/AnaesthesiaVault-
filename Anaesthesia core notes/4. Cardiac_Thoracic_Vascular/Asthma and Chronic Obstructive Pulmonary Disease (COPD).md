# Asthma
- Defined as airway hyper-responsiveness causing variable and reversible airflow obstruction
![](Pasted%20image%2020240311144413.png)
## Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240517000804.png)

## Pathogenesis

[Asthma Calgary Guide](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/asthma-pathogenesis/)

### Etiology
#### Genetic Factors
- HLA gene mutations
- Defects in bronchial airway epithelium
#### Environmental Factors
- Excess hygiene
- Fewer siblings
- Antibiotics within the first two years
#### Atopy
- Predisposition to allergic hypersensitivity in airways
### Pathophysiology

![](Pasted%20image%2020240701171157.png)

#### Triggers of Airway Hyper-responsiveness
- Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs)
- Allergens (pollen, animal dander, dust, mold, etc.)
- Air pollution, cigarette smoke, other chemicals
- Drugs (aspirin, NSAIDs, beta-blockers)
- Cold air
- Exercise
#### First Exposure to Triggers
- Sensitizes helper T cells
- Stimulation of B-cells to produce IgE, which binds to mast cell surfaces
- Activated helper T cells and IgE-sensitized mast cells now line the airways
##### Note
- Asthma attacks often have two phases:
  - **Immediate Attack**: Within 0-2 hours of the trigger, due to the acute release of histamine from mast cells.
  - **Delayed Attack**: Due to eosinophil infiltration of airways, presents within 3-4 hours after exposure, peaks within 6-8 hours, and resolves within 24 hours.
- Keep the possibility of a delayed attack in mind when treating patients in an emergency setting.
- Delayed response presents within 3-4 hours, peaks within 6-8 hours, and resolves within 24 hours.

## Asthma: Clinical Findings

[Asthma clinical findings](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/asthma-pathogenesis/)

[Asthma Investigations](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Asthma:-Findings-on-Investigations/)

### Variable, Sporadic Airway Obstruction in Response to Triggers
- During expiration, positive pleural pressure increases airway obstruction.
### Severe Asthma
- **Decreased Ventilation of Alveoli**:
  - Leads to decreased oxygenation of blood (hypoxemia)
  - Heart rate increases to improve perfusion of tissue (Tachycardia)
  - Respiratory centers increase the rate of breathing to compensate (Tachypnea)
### Symptoms
- Episodic Dyspnea (Shortness of Breath)
- Chest Tightness
- Expiratory Wheeze (High-pitched expiratory sound)
- Prolonged Expiratory Phase of Breathing
- Visible Contraction of Neck Muscles (Scalene, Sternocleidomastoids)
- Symptoms are often worse at night or early in the morning.
- Asthma should be suspected in children experiencing dyspnea with multiple episodes of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections or Croup.
#### Eosinophil Infiltration and Allergic Response
- **Nose**: Rhinitis/sinusitis (Runny nose, sneezing, etc.)
- **Skin**: Atopic dermatitis (Skin rash, hives)
- **Eyes**: Conjunctivitis (Red itchy eyes, visual blurring)
### Gas Trapping and Lung Hyperinflation
- Gas is trapped within alveoli, hyperinflating the lungs.
- Ventilating larger lungs requires more effort.
### Mechanisms
- Patients need to contract their expiratory muscles faster and more forcefully to effectively expire.
- Narrower airways cause turbulent airflow, heard on auscultation.
## Asthma Diagnosis

![](Pasted%20image%2020240615083227.png)

### Spirometry (Flow-Volume Loop)

- Features of airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC ratio < 70%)
- Spirometry may be normal
#### Reversibility

##### Procedure
- **Short-acting β-agonist**: 4 puffs using a spacer (400 µg)
- **Wait 10-15 minutes** and repeat the flow volume loop
- **Patient Preparation**:
  - Should not have taken their own drugs/pumps for asthma:
	- 4-6 hours (short-acting)
	- 12-24 hours (long-acting)
##### Reversibility Criteria
- Increase in FEV1 and/or FVC > 12% and 200 ml
##### Important Notes
- The test cannot reliably distinguish asthma from COPD.
- Bronchodilator (BD) response does not predict symptomatic improvement.
- Absence of response does not predict lack of symptom improvement.

### Other Tests

- Specialized centres: bronchoprovocation challenge testing (inhaled metacholine/mannitol, exercise), exhaled nitric oxide
### CXR

- Typically normal
### Findings During an Asthma Attack

#### Mucus Plugs and Airway Smooth Muscle Constriction

- **Total expiration time is prolonged**
- **Spirometry**:
  - FEV1 < 80%
  - FEV1/FVC < 0.7
 **Ventilation and Hypoxemia
- Decreased ventilation of alveoli
- Reduced oxygenation of blood (hypoxemia)
- Mild decrease in PaO2
- Increased respiratory rate to compensate

#### Indications for Immediate Intubation

![](Pasted%20image%2020240615085503.png)

##### Airway Management

1. Rapid sequence induction
2. Patients are exhausted, with little physiological reserve, high risk of rapid desaturation, and hypotension after receiving sedating medications and neuromuscular blocking agents
3. Pre-oxygenation via active breathing through a bag valve mask
4. Ventilation should be delivered by bag and mask using a small tidal volume and high inspiratory flow rate with a prolonged expiratory phase
5. Start with the patient sitting upright, then once the patient loses consciousness, place the patient in a supine position and perform laryngoscopy and intubation
6. Large endotracheal tube (8 - 9 mm), nasal intubation not recommended
7. Pre-treatment with lignocaine (1.5 mg/kg IV three minutes before induction)
8. Induction agent: ketamine/propofol
## Conduct of Anaesthesia in Asthma

### Pre-operative Optimization
- **Postpone elective surgery if**:
  - New diagnosis
  - Non-compliance with treatment
  - Smoking
  - Current infection or exacerbation
  - Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) < 80% or if reversibility is demonstrated on Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) (≥ 12% or ≥ 200 mL improvement in FEV₁ post bronchodilator)
- **Medical Management**:
  - Chest physiotherapy, bronchodilators, anti-inflammatories (e.g., leukotriene inhibitors) should be continued until induction. Nebulizers every 4-6 hours if uncontrolled.
  - Steroid supplementation if the patient has been treated with steroids.
### Anaesthetic Technique
- **Preferred Techniques**: Regional, Neuraxial, or Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) if suitable.
- **Intubation**:
  - Ensure adequately deep anaesthesia.
  - Consider Lignocaine 1-1.5 mg/kg IV or endotracheal.
#### Drug Considerations
- **Induction**:
  - Propofol if haemodynamically stable.
  - Ketamine if not haemodynamically stable.
- **Opioids**:
  - To suppress cough, use Fentanyl or Remifentanil.
- **Non-depolarizing Muscle Relaxants (NDMR)**:
  - Avoid histamine releasers (e.g., Atracurium, Mivacurium).
- **Hydration**: Ensure adequate hydration.
### Ventilation
- Ensure adequate expiration time.
- Use humidification and warming.
### Extubation
- Perform deep extubation or LMA exchange to minimize airway irritation.
### Acute Exacerbations of Asthma (Intraoperative)
#### Assess Severity

![](Pasted%20image%2020240615090838.png)

### Treatment of Acute Exacerbation
1. **Inhaled Bronchodilators:**
   - β2-Agonists by nebulizer (salbutamol 10/2 mL) continuously or 6-8 puffs down ETT
   - Ipratropium bromide by nebulizer (0.5 mg) or 6-8 puffs down ETT
   - Combination therapy better

3. **Systemic Corticosteroids:**
   - Oral prednisone 30-60 mg/day
   - IV hydrocortisone (100-200 mg 6 hourly)
   - Methylprednisolone (80-125 mg 8-12 hourly), 10-14 days, IV vs PO

4. **Magnesium Sulphate:**
   - 2 g (8 mmol) IV over 20 min single dose
   - Benefit in severe bronchospasm
   - Contra-indication in renal insufficiency
#### Additional Treatments

1. **Anaesthetic Agents:**
   - Ketamine IV bolus 0.5-1 mg/kg over 2-4 min, then infusion 0.5-2 mg/kg/hour
   - Inhaled halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, sevoflurane

2. **Parenteral Beta-Agonists:**
   - Suspected anaphylactic reaction or unable to use inhaled bronchodilators
   - Adrenaline 0.3 to 0.5 mg IM/SC (1:1000 solution)

3. **Helium-Oxygen (Heliox):**
   - Via nebulizer or in ventilated patients

4. **Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists:**
   - Montelukast 10 mg daily in patients whose exacerbation was triggered by ingestion of aspirin or NSAID

5. **Intravenous Methylxanthines:**
   - (Theophylline, aminophylline) not recommended, but can continue chronic oral therapy

6. **Antibiotics:**
   - If suspected bacterial sinusitis or pneumonia complicating an asthmatic attack (cover atypical organisms)

# COPD

[COPD Definition_Calgory](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/COPD:-Findings-on-Investigations/)

## Definition
- 3 separate entities:
	- Chronic bronchitis (swelling and inflammation of the bronchi)
	- Emphysema (damage to the alveoli) 
	- Peripheral airway disease
	- Pulmonary function tests:
		- FEV1/FVC ratio <0.7 with suggestive history

## Overview
- **Systemic disease**, largely manifesting as an **airflow-obstructing respiratory disorder**
- Can manifest in the form of any of the following disorders:
![](Pasted%20image%2020240701170953.png)

[View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.](https://whimsical.com/manifestations-of-copd-3LEz547WtJvPdTNb9ipZG9?ref=chatgpt)

#### Most Common COPD Manifestations
- Most patients suffer from a combination of emphysema and chronic bronchitis
#### Clinical Features of COPD
- **Progressive, partially reversible airflow obstruction** and lung hyperinflation (causing respiratory symptoms like cough, sputum production, and dyspnea)
- **Post-bronchodilator spirometry results:**
  - FEV1/FVC ratio <0.7 (FEV1 is not a defining feature of COPD, but a marker of severity)
- **↑ Frequency and severity of acute exacerbations**
- **Systemic manifestations** such as deconditioning and muscle weakness
## Pathogenesis

[COPD Pathogenesis](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/COPD:-Pathogenesis/)

### Contributing Factors

#### Genetic Susceptibility
- Example: **α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) deficiency**
- ↓ Lung’s ability to prevent damage to lung tissue
#### Environmental Insult to Lungs
- Examples: **Long-term smoking, pollution, infection**
- Free radicals produced in lungs
- Inactivation of lung anti-proteases
##### Result: Lung Inflammation
- ↑ Oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and protease function
### Consequences

#### Continued, Repeated Injury to the Bronchial Tree
- Infiltration of inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils
- Goblet cell proliferation, ↑ mucus production
- Death of airway epithelium ciliated cells
- Airway fibrosis and narrowing
- Mucus trapped in airway, serving as nidus for infection
#### Proteolytic Destruction of Lung Parenchyma
- ↓ Airway elasticity (recoil ability)
- ↓ Structural supports for airway patency
- Trapping of air within lungs
- Airway narrowing and collapse
- Hyper-inflated lungs
- Permanent enlargement of alveoli
- Bullae (easily ruptured air sacs) on lung surface
### Pathological Outcomes

#### Chronic Bronchitis
- Airway fibrosis and narrowing
- Mucus trapped in airways, serving as nidus for infection
#### Emphysema
- ↓ Airway elasticity
- Airway narrowing and collapse
- Hyper-inflated lungs
- Permanent enlargement of alveoli
- Bullae on lung surface
## Clinical Findings

## Investigations

[COPD Investigations](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/COPD:-Findings-on-Investigations/)

[CXR findings](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/copd-findings-on-posterior-anterior-and-lateral-chest-x-ray-findings/)

### Pathophysiology
1. **Airflow Obstruction**
	- ↓ Ventilation of alveoli
	- Blood perfusing ill-ventilated alveoli does not receive normal amounts of oxygen
	- Ventilation-perfusion mismatch
2. **Hypoxemia: PaO2 < 70 mmHg (on ABGs)**
	- High A-a gradient (calculated from ABGs)
3. **FEV1/FEV < 0.7 (on spirometry)**
	- During expiration, positive pleural pressure squeezes on airways → ↑ obstruction
	- Total expiration time takes longer than normal
4. **Lung Tissue Damage**
	- No elastic recoil to push air out of lungs
	- Lungs don’t fully empty
	- More air trapped within lungs (hyperinflation)
	- Loss of lung parenchyma and vasculature ↓ surface area for gas exchange
	- ↓ Diffusion capacity (on spirometry)
	- More CO2 remains and diffuses into the blood
5. **Hypercapnia: PaCO2 > 45 (on ABGs)**
	- Chronic hypercapnia makes breathing centers less sensitive to the high PaCO2 stimulus for breathing, & more reliant on the low PaO2 stimulus ("CO2 retention")
	- Give O2 carefully to these patients (high PaO2 may suppress patients’ hypoxic respiratory drive, ↓ their breathing, & ↑↑↑ PaCO2)
### Chest X-Ray Findings
1. **Low, Flat Diaphragm, > 10 Posterior Ribs (on frontal CXR)**
	- High TLC and VC (on spirometry)
	- Air does not block X-ray beams, will appear black on X-ray film
2. **↑ Retrosternal Air Space (on lateral CXR)**
	- Hyper-lucent (darker) lung fields, ↓ lung markings (on frontal CXR)
#### Findings on Posterior-Anterior and Lateral Chest X-ray

##### Pathophysiology
1. **Lung Inflammation Causes**
	- Proteolytic destruction of lung parenchyma (part of lungs involved in gas exchange)
	- Alveolar walls are damaged → formation of fragile enlarged sacs of air called bullae
2. **Hyperinflation as Air Becomes Trapped in Damaged Lungs**
	- Total volume of air within the chest ↑
	- Airway fibrosis → bronchial wall thickening (yellow arrow heads)
	- Bullae sometimes visible on X-ray (focal areas of lucency with spread out vascular markings)
3. **Pulmonary Hypertension**
	- Vasoconstriction of pulmonary arteries to shunt blood to better ventilated areas
	- Enlargement of pulmonary arteries
	- Hilar enlargement
4. **Lung Hyperinflation**
	- Defined as 10 posterior ribs above the diaphragm level on the midclavicular line
	- ↑ Lucency of the lung field, ↓ lung markings (unless COPD is of chronic bronchitis phenotype)
	- ↑ Size of retrosternal airspace
	- ↑ Anterior-posterior (AP) diameter ("Barrel Chest")
	- Flattening of hemidiaphragms
5. **Pressure Changes**
	- Pressure anteriorly on sternum
	- Pressure posteriorly on thoracic wall
	- Pressure posteriorly on diaphragms
6. **Rupture of Bullae Due to Weak Alveolar Walls**
	- Air leaves alveola and enters pleural space
	- Pneumothorax
## Diagnosis

### Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)

- **Findings**:
	
	- Decreased FEV₁
	- Decreased FEV₁/FVC (< 0.7 defines obstruction)
	- Markedly decreased FEF25%-75%
	- Increased FRC and TLC
- **Clinical Implications**:
	
	- Clinical findings such as smoking history, wheezing, and cough are more predictive of postoperative complications.
	- PFTs are indicated in cases of hypoxemia, undiagnosed respiratory conditions, severe disease, or when pneumonectomy is planned.

### Chest X-Ray (CXR)

- Hyperlucency
- Hyperinflation (flattened diaphragm, loss of dome shape)
- Vertical cardiac silhouette

### Computed Tomography (CT)

- Bronchial wall thickening
- Alveolar septal destruction
- Airspace enlargement
- Primarily used for cancer screening

### Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)

- Decreased PaO₂ when FEV₁ < 50% predicted
- Decreased PaCO₂ occurs even later in disease progression

### Echocardiography (ECHO)

- Used to assess right ventricular (RV) function

## Staging (GOLD)

The GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) staging for COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is based on the severity of airflow limitation as measured by spirometry, specifically the FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second). The staging is as follows:

**GOLD 1: Mild**

- FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted

**GOLD 2: Moderate**

- 50% ≤ FEV1 < 80% predicted

**GOLD 3: Severe**

- 30% ≤ FEV1 < 50% predicted

**GOLD 4: Very Severe**

- FEV1 < 30% predicted

In addition to these stages, the GOLD guidelines also consider symptoms and history of exacerbations to further classify COPD into groups A, B, C, and D, which help guide treatment:

- **Group A**: Low symptoms, low risk (0-1 exacerbations per year and no hospitalizations)
- **Group B**: High symptoms, low risk (0-1 exacerbations per year and no hospitalizations)
- **Group C**: Low symptoms, high risk (≥2 exacerbations per year or ≥1 leading to hospitalization)
- **Group D**: High symptoms, high risk (≥2 exacerbations per year or ≥1 leading to hospitalization)

The symptom assessment is often done using the Modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) questionnaire or the COPD Assessment Test (CAT).

## COPD Exacerbation

[COPD exacerbation](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/copd-acute-exacerbations-triggers-and-signs-symptoms/)

### Triggers
1. **Acute Bacterial Infection**
	
	- Activation of proinflammatory cytokines and recruitment of neutrophils
2. **Acute Viral Infection**
	
	- Epithelial cell secretion of cytokines and ↑ airway lymphocytosis
3. **Air Pollution (including cigarette smoke)**
	
	- ↑ Reactive oxygen species in lungs
### Pathophysiology

- **Acute ↑ in Airway Inflammation:**
	- Accumulation of inflammatory cells and release of harmful mediators, such as reactive oxygen species and proteases, into the lung tissue/airways
#### Consequences
1. **Airway Inflammation:**
	
	- ↑ Secretions that accumulate in the airway lumen
	- Irritation of cough reflexes in airways
	- Cough
	- ↑ Sputum production and sputum purulence
2. **Airway Wall Edema:**
	
	- Limits outflow of air from lungs on expiration
	- Blood flow to lungs continues to perfuse under-ventilated regions of lungs → V/Q mismatch
	- Acute Respiratory Failure
	- Tachypnea
3. **Airway Bronchoconstriction in Response to Inflammation:**
	
	- Constricted airways create audible turbulent airflow on expiration
	- **↑ Wheeze**
	- Unexpired air becomes trapped in the lungs → dynamic hyperinflation
	- **Dyspnea**
	- **Accessory Muscle Use**
4. **Systemic Spread of Inflammatory Markers via the Bloodstream Causes Inflammation Throughout the Body:**
	
	- **↑ CRP**
	- **↑ Cardiac Morbidity**
	- Worsening of respiratory symptoms
#### Notes
- The triggers for acute exacerbations of COPD are unknown in approximately 1/3 of cases
- Changes in pulmonary function (e.g., FEV₁) are poorly sensitive in the individual diagnosis of acute exacerbations of COPD due to individual variability

## COPD and Anaesthesia Management

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311160017.png)

### Pre-op Optimization

#### 1. History and Examination
- Directed towards causes, course, and severity of COPD.
- Note smoking history, steroid use, NIPPV use, and comorbidities.
#### 2. Relevant Investigations
- Conduct appropriate diagnostic tests to assess the patient's pulmonary status and comorbid conditions.
#### 3. Smoking Cessation
- Encourage cessation for at least 6 weeks prior to surgery.
#### 4. Continue Medications
- Continue long-acting bronchodilators, anticholinergics, and inhaled steroids until the morning of surgery.
#### 5. Treat Expiratory Airflow Obstruction
- Use antibiotics for respiratory infections.
#### 6. Optimize Nutritional Status
- Aim for an albumin level ≥ 3.5 mg/dL as it is a predictor of post-op pulmonary complications.
### Principles of Anesthesia

#### 1. Regional Anesthesia
- Useful if sedation is not needed.
- Avoid interscalene blocks in severe COPD.
- Prefer neuraxial blocks below T6.
#### 2. General Anesthesia
- Avoid N₂O due to risk of bullae rupture leading to pneumothorax.
- Cautiously use opioids to avoid respiratory depression.
- Use endotracheal tube (ETT) with low flows to encourage humidification and warmth.
#### 3. Ventilation
- Employ controlled ventilation strategies to minimize complications.
#### 4. Potential Intraoperative Complications
- Be vigilant for air-trapping, bronchospasm, and rupture of bullae leading to pneumothorax, which may not respond to vent disconnection.
#### 5. Postoperative Care
- Employ lung expansion maneuvers (deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry, chest physiotherapy, positive pressure breathing techniques).
- Use CPAP/Nasal PAP if other methods are unsuccessful.
- Utilize post-op neuraxial analgesia with opioids to facilitate early extubation.
- Encourage early ambulation.
- Post-op ventilation may be necessary in severe cases.

### Strategies to Reduce Post-op Complications

#### Preoperative
1. Encourage smoking cessation for at least 6 weeks.
2. Treat expiratory airflow obstruction.
3. Use antibiotics for respiratory infections.
4. Educate patients on lung volume expansion maneuvers.
#### Intraoperative
1. Use minimally invasive (endoscopic) surgery when possible.
2. Consider regional anesthesia.
3. Avoid procedures likely to last longer than 3 hours.
#### Postoperative
1. Institute lung volume expansion maneuvers:
   - Voluntary deep breathing
   - Incentive spirometry
   - Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
2. Maximize analgesia:
   - Neuraxial opioids
   - Intercostal nerve blocks
   - Patient-controlled analgesia
### Ventilation in COPD
- Use controlled ventilation with low tidal volumes (5-8 mL/kg predicted body weight) to allow permissive hypercapnia (pH ≥ 7.25).
- Set a low respiratory rate (8-10 bpm) with longer expiratory times to reduce air trapping.
- Maintain plateau pressures < 15-20 cmH₂O.
- Adjust FiO₂ to keep SpO₂ > 90%.
- Apply PEEP cautiously (5-10 cmH₂O) to keep small airways open, with continuous monitoring for hyperinflation signs.
- Manage dynamic hyperinflation by reducing minute ventilation (lower RR and tidal volume) and sometimes increasing inspiratory flow to decrease inspiratory time.
- If auto-PEEP (intrinsic PEEP) persists, cautiously add extrinsic PEEP at levels below 80% of measured auto-PEEP.
- Consider intermittently disconnecting the ventilator to allow for expiration.

### Equal Pressure Points and PEEP

**A. Pre-inspiration**

- **Intrapleural Pressure:** -5 cmH2O
- **Alveolar Pressure:** 0 cmH2O
- **Atmospheric Pressure:** +5 cmH2O
- Before inspiration, the intrapleural pressure is negative, maintaining the alveoli slightly open with a pressure difference from the atmospheric pressure.

**B. During Inspiration**

- **Intrapleural Pressure:** -7 cmH2O
- **Alveolar Pressure:** -2 cmH2O
- **Atmospheric Pressure:** +6 cmH2O
- During inspiration, the intrapleural pressure becomes more negative, reducing the alveolar pressure further and allowing air to flow into the lungs as the pressure gradient between the alveoli and the atmosphere increases.

**C. End-Inspiration**

- **Intrapleural Pressure:** -8 cmH2O
- **Alveolar Pressure:** 0 cmH2O
- **Atmospheric Pressure:** +8 cmH2O
- At the end of inspiration, the alveolar pressure equalizes with atmospheric pressure while the intrapleural pressure remains negative, maintaining lung expansion.

**D. Forced Expiration**

- **Intrapleural Pressure:** +30 cmH2O
- **Alveolar Pressure:** +38 cmH2O
- **Atmospheric Pressure:** -11 cmH2O
- During forced expiration, intrapleural pressure becomes positive, greatly increasing alveolar pressure and promoting rapid expulsion of air from the lungs.

#### Reduced Alveolar Emptying in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Asthma, and Emphysema (Image 2)

Mechanisms behind reduced alveolar emptying in conditions like COPD, asthma, and emphysema due to pathological changes in the bronchiole wall and altered forces acting to keep it open during exhalation.

- **Optimal Emptying of Alveolus During Exhalation:** Normal alveolar and bronchiolar structure allows for effective emptying of air during exhalation.
	
- **Increased Transmural Pressure Gradient:** In COPD, asthma, and emphysema, there is an increased transmural pressure gradient across the bronchiole wall favoring its collapse during exhalation.
	
- **Intrinsic PEEP (PEEPi):** Incomplete emptying of alveolus during exhalation leads to intrinsic PEEP, increasing residual volume and trapping air.
	
- **Factors Contributing to Bronchiole Collapse:**
	
	- **Increased Intrathoracic Pressure:** Elevated pressure on the bronchiole due to increased intrathoracic pressure.
	- **Loss of Elasticity:** Reduced traction on the bronchiole from loss of elasticity in lung parenchyma.
	- **Increased Secretions and Bronchospasm:** Increased secretions and active bronchospasm contribute to airway narrowing.
	- **Loss of Rigidity:** Inflammation leads to loss of rigidity in the bronchiole wall.
	- **Bernoulli’s Law:** Increased airflow velocity during exhalation causes decreased intraluminal pressure, leading to bronchiole collapse.
