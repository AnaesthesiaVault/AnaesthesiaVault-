# Thoracic Pre-operative Assessment
## Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240521015049.png)

## Risk Assessment

### Introduction
- All patients undergoing pulmonary resections should have a preoperative assessment of their respiratory function in three areas:
	- Lung mechanical function
	- Pulmonary parenchymal function
	- Cardiopulmonary reserve (the “three-legged stool” of respiratory assessment)
- Following pulmonary resection surgery, patients with adequate predicted postoperative respiratory function can often be weaned and extubated in the operating room if they are “AWaC” (alert, warm, and comfortable)

### Summary of Initial Assessment
- **Initial Preanesthetic Assessment for Thoracic Surgery:**
	- **For all patients:**
		- Assess exercise tolerance
		- Simple spirometry: estimate ppoFEV1%
		- Discuss postoperative analgesia
		- Smoking cessation
	- **Patients with ppoFEV1 <40%:**
		- Full pulmonary function testing including DLCO
		- Ventilation/perfusion lung scan if possible pneumonectomy and exercise testing
	- **Cancer patients:**
		- Consider the “4 M’s”: mass effects, metabolic effects, metastases, and medications
	- **COPD patients:**
		- Physiotherapy, bronchodilators, arterial blood gas if moderate or severe COPD
	- **Increased renal risk:**
		- Measure creatinine

## Respiratory Function Assessment
- Major respiratory complications such as atelectasis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure occur in 15–20% of patients and account for the majority of the expected 3–4% mortality
- Cardiac complications such as arrhythmia and ischemia occur in 10–15% of the thoracic population

### Spirometry
- All pulmonary resection patients should have baseline simple spirometry preoperatively to measure forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC)
- These values should always be expressed as a percent of predicted volumes corrected for age, sex, and height
- The most valid single test for post-thoracotomy respiratory complications is the predicted postoperative FEV1 (ppoFEV1%), calculated as:
	- ppoFEV1% = preoperative FEV1% x (1 - % functional lung tissue removed / 100)
	- Estimation of the percent of functional lung tissue is based on the number of functioning subsegments of the lung removed
	- Patients with a ppoFEV1 >40% typically experience no or minor post-resection respiratory complications
	- Major respiratory complications are usually seen in patients with ppoFEV1 <40%; 100% of patients with ppoFEV1 <30% require postoperative mechanical ventilatory support
		- A threshold value of ppoFEV1 45% is more appropriate for an aging surgical population

### Predicted Postoperative Pulmonary Function

#### Calculation of Predicted Postoperative FEV1 (ppoFEV1)

**Anatomic Method (Lungs Contain 19 Segments)**  
- ppoFEV1 = preoperative FEV1 x {(19 - segments to be removed) / 19}

**Segments:**
- Right: Upper lobe (3), Middle lobe (2), Lower lobe (5)
- Left: Upper lobe (3), Lingula (2), Lower lobe (4)

**Perfusion Method**  
- ppoFEV1 = preoperative FEV1 x (1 - fraction of total perfusion of resected lung)

#### PPOFEV1
- PPO FEV1 <0.85L is associated with a high risk of developing respiratory failure

### Preoperative and Postoperative Assessment

**Assessment Criteria:**
- **ppoFEV1 > 80% or > 2L:**
	- Pneumonectomy: No further testing required
	- Lobectomy: No further testing required
- **ppoFEV1 < 80% or < 2L for Pneumonectomy or < 1.5L for Lobectomy:**
	- Calculate ppoFEV1
	- Perform DLCO and express as % of predicted DLCO
	- Measure saturations (SpO2) on air

**Risk Stratification:**
- **ppoFEV1 < 40% and DLCO < 40%:** High risk
- **ppoFEV1 > 40% and DLCO > 40% and SpO2 > 90%:** Average risk (no further testing)
- Other combinations require further exercise testing

**Shuttle Walk Test:**
- < 25 shuttles or desaturation > 4%: High risk
- > 25 shuttles and < 4% desaturation:
	- VO2 max < 15 mL/kg/min: High risk
	- VO2 max > 15 mL/kg/min: Average risk
- Patients at increased risk of respiratory complications (ppoFEV1 <40%) should undergo complete pulmonary function testing, including assessment of lung volumes and airway resistance. Two basic methods of measurement are insoluble gas dilution and plethysmography.

### Plethysmography
**Body Plethysmography Method for Determination of FRC:**
- Mouth pressure (Pm) reflects change in alveolar pressure
- Box pressure (Pm) reflects change in lung volume
- Patient seated in an airtight box, performing panting efforts against a closed shutter

#### Validity of Tests (ATS/ERS Guidelines)

**Technicalities:**
- Operator: Trained, meticulous technique
- Patient: Cooperative, sitting or standing, maximum effort
- Apparatus: Calibrated daily, appropriate fitting
- Interpretation: Correct reference values considering age, height, gender, environment

**Acceptability and Reproducibility:**
- Good start: No cough, hesitation, obstruction, artifacts, early termination, air leaks, or obstructed mouthpiece
- Exhalation: Complete or at least 6 seconds
- Maximum of 8 attempts for 3 reproducible efforts: At least 2 within 150 mL or 5%

### Pulmonary Parenchymal Testing
- Traditionally, arterial blood gas data such as PaO2 <60 mmHg or PaCO2 >45 mmHg have been used as cut-off values for pulmonary resection.
- The most useful test of the gas exchange capacity of the lung is the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO).
	- DLCO reflects the total functioning surface area of the alveolar-capillary interface.
	- This test, included with spirometry and plethysmography by most pulmonary function laboratories, is a useful predictor of perioperative morbidity and mortality.
	- The corrected DLCO can be used to calculate a post-resection (ppo) value using the same calculation as for the FEV1.
		- A ppoDLCO <40% predicted correlates with increased respiratory and cardiac complications and is largely independent of the FEV1.
	- The National Emphysema Treatment Trial showed that patients with a preoperative FEV1 or DLCO <20% had an unacceptably high perioperative mortality rate.
	- These values are considered the minimal values compatible with a successful outcome.

### Diffusing Capacity of Carbon Monoxide (DLCO)

**Decreased DLCO:**
- Decreased membrane surface area (emphysema)
- Increased membrane thickness (ILD)
- Anemia
- Pulmonary hypertension

**Increased DLCO:**
- Pulmonary hemorrhage
- Asthma
- Polycythemia
- Exercise

### Cardiopulmonary Interaction
- After pulmonary resection, there is a degree of right ventricular dysfunction proportional to the amount of functioning pulmonary vascular bed removed. The exact etiology and duration of this dysfunction remain unknown. Clinical evidence of this hemodynamic problem is minimal at rest but dramatic during exercise, leading to elevated pulmonary vascular pressures, limitation of cardiac output, and absence of the normal decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance with exertion.

### VO2 Max
- Formal laboratory exercise testing is the “gold standard” for assessing cardiopulmonary function, with maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) being the most useful predictor of post-thoracotomy outcome.
- The test is performed on a bicycle ergometer or treadmill. Resting measurements are made for 3–5 minutes. Three minutes of unloaded cycling is performed as a warm-up period. The workload is incremented to reach maximum work capacity in 8–12 minutes.
	- The test continues to symptom limitation (e.g., severe dyspnea) or discontinuation by medical staff (e.g., significant ECG abnormalities) or achievement of maximum predicted heart rate.
	- Estimated VO2 max is based on age, sex, and height. For sedentary males, VO2 max (mL/min) = (height (cm) − age (years)) × 20. For sedentary females, VO2 max = ((height (cm) − age (years)) × 14) / weight (kg).
	- The risk of morbidity and mortality is unacceptably high if preoperative VO2 max is <15 mL/kg/min. Few patients with VO2 max >20 mL/kg/min have respiratory complications.

### Anaerobic Threshold
- The anaerobic threshold, measured during exercise testing, is a predictor of postoperative complications.
	- The anaerobic threshold is the exercise level at which lactate begins to accumulate in the blood and anaerobic metabolism begins, approximately 55% of VO2 max in untrained individuals but >80% in trained athletes.
	- It can be documented by repeated blood lactate analysis during exercise or by a threshold increase in CO2 production above the initial respiratory quotient.
	- A threshold value for the anaerobic threshold of <11 mL/kg/min suggests increased risk, but this is not well validated.

### 6-Minute Walk Test
- The distance a patient can walk during a 6-minute test (6MWT) correlates well with VO2 max and requires little or no laboratory equipment.
- For patients with moderate or severe COPD, the 6MWT distance can be used to estimate VO2 max by dividing by 30 (e.g., 600 m distance is equivalent to a VO2 max of 20 mL/kg/min).

### Fall in SpO2
- Some centers assess the fall in oximetry (SpO2) during exercise. A decrease of SpO2 >4% during exercise indicates increased risk of morbidity and mortality.

### Amount of Functional Lung Tissue Removed
- Post-resection exercise capacity can be estimated based on the amount of functioning lung tissue removed. A ppoVO2 max <10 mL/kg/min is considered a contraindication to pulmonary resection.
- Mortality was 100% (3/3) in patients with a ppoVO2 max <10 mL/kg/min in a small series.

### Stair Climbing
- The ability to climb stairs is a useful test in ambulatory patients. The ability to climb five flights correlates with VO2 max >20 mL/kg/min; climbing two flights corresponds to a VO2 max of 12 mL/kg/min. Patients unable to climb two flights are at extremely high risk.

### Regional Lung Function
- Prediction of post-resection pulmonary function can be refined by assessing the preoperative contribution of the lung or lobe to be resected using imaging of regional lung function, particularly useful for pneumonectomy patients.
- Regional lung function imaging should be ordered for any potential pneumonectomy patient with preoperative FEV1 and/or DLCO <80% (i.e., ppo values <40% predicted).
- Regional lung function imaging can be performed by:
	- Radionuclide ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning
	- Pulmonary quantitative CT scanning
	- Three-dimensional dynamic perfusion MRI

### V/Q Scanning
- Ventilation/perfusion lung scanning is the gold standard.
	- Regional ventilation is assessed by scanning after inhalation of a radio-labeled insoluble gas (commonly xenon-133).
	- Regional lung perfusion is assessed by scanning after intravenous injection of radiolabeled particles trapped in the pulmonary capillaries (commonly technetium-99 m macroaggregated albumin).
	- Postoperative lung function shows high correlation with predicted values based on preoperative V/Q scanning for FEV1 (r = 0.92), DLCO (r = 0.90), and VO2 max (r = 0.85).
	- Prediction is more accurate for post-pneumonectomy versus post-lobectomy values. If there is a discrepancy between ventilation and perfusion scan results, it is preferable to use the result attributing the larger proportion of ventilation or perfusion to the diseased lung for post-resection pulmonary function estimation.

### 3-Legged Approach
- No single test of respiratory function has shown adequate validity as a sole preoperative assessment. An estimate of respiratory function in all three areas (lung mechanics, parenchymal function, and cardiopulmonary interaction) should be made for each patient, forming the “three-legged stool” of pre-thoracotomy respiratory assessment.

### Pre-Thoracotomy Respiratory Assessment (3-Legged Stool)

**Respiratory Mechanics:**
- FEV1* (ppo > 40%)
- MVV, RV/TLC, FVC

**Cardiopulmonary Reserve:**
- VO2 max* (> 15 ml/kg/min)
	- Stair climb > 2 flights
	- 6-minute walk
	- Exercise SpO2 < 4%

**Lung Parenchymal Function:**
- DLCO* (ppo > 40%)
- PaO2 > 60
- PaCO2 < 45

### Anesthetic Management

**Predicted Postoperative FEV1 (ppoFEV1%):**
- **> 40%:**
	- Extubate in the operating room if the patient is AWaC (alert, warm, and comfortable)
- **30-40%:**
	- Consider extubation based on exercise tolerance, DLCO, V/Q scan, and associated diseases
- **< 30%:**
	- Staged weaning from mechanical ventilation
	- Consider extubation if > 20% plus thoracic epidural analgesia

## Post-Thoracotomy Complications

### Post-Lobectomy Complications and Hospital Length of Stay (LOS)

| Complication          | All Patients (n = 4,979) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Pneumonia             | 4%                       |
| Atelectasis           | 4%                       |

| Pulmonary Embolus     | 0.3%                     |
| Atrial Arrhythmias    | 12%                      |
| Air Leak              | 10%                      |

## Associated Medical Conditions

### Cardiac

#### Ischemia
- The overall documented incidence of post-thoracotomy ischemia is 5%, peaking on day 2–3 postoperatively
- Patients with intermediate clinical predictors of increased cardiac risk (stable angina, diabetes, etc.) who have adequate functional capacity do not need further cardiac investigation prior to pulmonary surgery
- Patients with intermediate predictors and poor functional capacity should have noninvasive testing of myocardial perfusion at rest and during stress

#### Cardiac Risk Assessment for Pulmonary Resection

**Intermediate Clinical Predictors:**
- Mild stable angina, previous myocardial infarction
- Diabetes
- Compensated/previous congestive heart failure

#### Arrhythmias
- Arrhythmias are common after pulmonary resection surgery, with an incidence of 30–50% in the first week postoperatively, particularly atrial fibrillation (60–70%)
- Factors correlating with increased arrhythmia incidence include the extent of lung resection (pneumonectomy 60%, lobectomy 40%, non-resection thoracotomy 30%), intra-pericardial dissection, intraoperative blood loss, and patient age
- Two factors in the early post-thoracotomy period produce atrial arrhythmias:
	1. Increased flow resistance through the pulmonary vascular bed due to permanent or transient causes
	2. Increased sympathetic stimuli and oxygen requirements, maximal on the second postoperative day as patients mobilize
- TEA with local anesthetics may decrease arrhythmia incidence by increasing the myocardial refractory period, decreasing ventricular diastolic pressures, and improving endocardial/epicardial blood flow ratios

### Age
- There is no maximum age cut off for pulmonary resection surgery. In one series, operative mortality in patients aged 80–92 was 3%, with respiratory complications at 40% and cardiac complications, particularly arrhythmias, at 40%
- For elderly patients, thoracotomy should be considered a high-risk procedure for cardiac complications, and cardiopulmonary function is the most important part of the preoperative assessment

#### Preoperative Cardiac Investigation in Geriatric Patients Prior to Pulmonary Resection Surgery

**Geriatric Patient:**
- Age > 70
- Acceptable exercise capacity

### METS

#### Energy Consumption in Metabolic Equivalents (METS)

| Activity                      | METS |
| ----------------------------- | ---- |
| Sitting quietly               | 1    |
| Walking 1 block               | 2    |
| Playing the accordion         | 2    |
| Climbing 1 flight stairs      | 4    |
| Sexual intercourse*           | 6    |
| Bowling*                      | 6    |
| Ice Hockey                    | 8    |
| Running 6 mph                 | 10   |
| Cross-country ski racing      | 14   |

_MET = basal oxygen consumption = 3.5 mL/kg/min_

### Renal Dysfunction

#### Postoperative Renal Dysfunction Risks
- Renal dysfunction, either preoperative dialysis or serum creatinine >2 mg/dL (>175 mmol/L), predicts prolonged length of stay after lobectomy

**Factors Associated with Increased Risk of Post-Thoracotomy Renal Impairment:**
- Previous history of renal impairment
- Diuretic therapy
- Pneumonectomy
- Postoperative infection
- Blood loss requiring transfusion
- Preoperative cisplatin chemotherapy

### COPD

#### COPD Optimization

**Treatable Complications:**
1. Atelectasis
2. Bronchospasm
3. Respiratory tract infections
4. Pulmonary edema

- All COPD patients should receive maximal bronchodilator therapy as guided by their symptoms

#### Concurrent Problems to Treat Prior to Anesthesia in COPD Patients

| Problem         | Method of Diagnosis       |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Bronchospasm    | Auscultation              |
| Atelectasis     | Chest X-ray               |
| Infection       | History, sputum analysis  |
| Pulmonary edema | Auscultation, chest X-ray |

**Physiotherapy:**
- Cough and deep breathing, incentive spirometry, PEEP, CPAP
- Patients with excessive sputum benefit from chest physiotherapy
- Comprehensive 8–12 week pulmonary rehabilitation programs improve functional capacity for patients with severe COPD; 4-week programs show promise

#### Smoking
- Pulmonary complications decrease in thoracic surgical patients who cease smoking >4 weeks before surgery
- Carboxyhemoglobin concentrations decrease if smoking stops >12 hours before surgery
- Wound healing and resistance to infection improve in patients who stop smoking >4 weeks preoperatively
- No rebound increase in pulmonary complications if smoking cessation is <8 weeks before surgery
- Patients should be counseled to stop smoking; longer cessation periods reduce postoperative complications

**Counseling:**

**Timing of Smoking Cessation and Effects on Physiological Recovery:**
- **12-24 hrs:** Negate effects of nicotine and COHb; increases physical work capacity by 10-20%
- **4-6 days:** Ciliary activity recovers; sputum production increases
- **5-10 days:** Laryngeal and bronchial reactivity settles
- **4 weeks:** Improvement in small-airway narrowing
- **6 weeks:** Sputum volume returns to normal
- **> 8 weeks:** 4x less pulmonary complication
- **3 months:** Tracheobronchial clearance improves
- **6 months:** Marked improvement; equal incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications as non-smokers

**Best result occurs when the patient stops 8 weeks or more before surgery.**

- Reduces perioperative-specific respiratory events and postoperative morbidity

**If the patient does not stop smoking 8 weeks before surgery:**
- Stop smoking 12 hours before surgery

## Malignancies

### 4-Ms
- Anesthetic considerations in lung cancer patients (the “4 M’s”):
	1. **Mass effects:** Obstructive pneumonia, lung abscess, SVC syndrome, tracheobronchial distortion, Pancoast’s syndrome, recurrent laryngeal nerve or phrenic nerve paresis, chest wall or mediastinal extension
	2. **Metabolic effects:** Lambert–Eaton syndrome, hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, Cushing’s syndrome
	3. **Metastases:** Particularly to brain, bone, liver, and adrenal
	4. **Medications:** Chemotherapy agents, pulmonary toxicity (Bleomycin, Mitomycin), cardiac toxicity (Doxorubicin), renal toxicity (Cisplatin)

### Anesthesia Considerations for Different Types of Lung Cancer

| Type         | Considerations                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Squamous cell| Central lesions (predominantly), mass effects: obstruction, cavitation, hypercalcemia, hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. |
| Adenocarcinoma| Peripheral lesions, metastases (distant), growth hormone, corticotropin.                                    |
| Small cell   | Central lesions (predominantly), few surgically treatable, paraneoplastic syndromes, Lambert–Eaton syndrome, fast growth rate, early metastases. |
| Carcinoid    | Proximal, intra-bronchial, no association with smoking, 5-year survival >90%, carcinoid syndrome (rarely).  |
| Mesothelioma | Intraoperative hemorrhage, direct extension to diaphragm, pericardium, etc.                                 |

## Final Risk Assessment
- Review initial assessment and test results
- Assess difficulty of lung isolation: examine preoperative chest imaging
- Assess risk of hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation

### Factors Correlating with Increased Risk of Desaturation During One-Lung Ventilation
- High percentage of ventilation or perfusion to the operative lung on preoperative V/Q scan
- Poor PaO2 during two-lung ventilation, particularly in the lateral position intraoperatively
- Right-sided thoracotomy
- Normal preoperative spirometry (FEV1 or FVC) or restrictive lung disease
- Supine position during one-lung ventilation

### Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale

| mMRC Grade | Description                                                                                                      | Severity Grouping |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1          | Breathless with strenuous exercise                                                                               | Mild              |
| 2          | Short of breath when hurrying on the level or walking up a slight hill                                           | Moderate          |
| 3          | Walks slower than people of the same age on the level or stops for breath while walking at own pace on the level | Severe            |
| 4          | Stops for breath after walking 100 m                                                                             | Severe            |
| 5          | Too breathless to leave the house or breathless when dressing                                                    | Severe            |

## Postoperative Dyspnoea

### Risk Assessment for Postoperative Dyspnoea

#### Spirometry and Transfer Factor

- **Low Risk:** ppo FEV1 ≥40% and ppo TLCO ≥40%
- **Moderate to High Risk:** ppo FEV1 <40% and/or ppo TLCO <40%

#### Functional Assessment

- **Good:** Moderate Risk: Inform patients of risk of mild-moderate postoperative shortness of breath with surgery or radiotherapy
- **Moderate/Poor:** High Risk: Inform patients of risk of severe postoperative dyspnoea and/or long-term oxygen therapy with surgery or radiotherapy

**Notes:**
1. Consider V/Q scanning for more accurate prediction of postoperative values
2. High risk of ventilator dependency in this group. Ensure criteria for lung volume reduction surgery are considered to improve ppo values and postoperative lung function.
