# Introduction

## Preconditioning
- **Preconditioning** involves changes at the biomolecular level that enable specialized tissues to better tolerate major adverse or ischemic events if they have already been exposed to several minor adverse or ischemic events.
	- **Postconditioning** refers to exposing the myocardium to brief, repeated, non-lethal periods of ischemia with intervening restoration of perfusion after a prolonged ischemic period. This process enables the myocardium to become resistant to the adverse effects of reperfusion injury.
## Time Periods Relevant to Ischemic Preconditioning: Early and Late Phase Windows

### Classically
- Ischemic preconditioning traditionally involves four brief periods of coronary artery occlusion followed by five-minute reperfusion intervals before a prolonged occlusion (Murray 2006).

### Early Phase Preconditioning
- The early window of protection occurs within 15 minutes up to 2-6 hours after ischemic preconditioning. During this time, the heart is resistant to further ischemic insults. It protects against myocardial infarction (MI) but not stunning.

### Late Phase (12-96 Hours)
- The late phase represents the second window of protection, dependent on gene up-regulation, reducing further myocardial risk to ischemia. It protects against MI and stunning.

## Pathophysiology

### Mechanisms of Preconditioning

**Early and Late Phases:**

- **Receptor Activation:**
  - Volatile agents
  - Pacing
  - Opiates
  - Bradykinin
  - Adenosine
  - Lidocaine
- **Intracellular Second Messengers:**
  - Protein Kinase C (PKC)
  - Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
  - Tyrosine Kinase
  - Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
  - Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS)
- **Mitochondrial and Sarcolemma Structures:**
  - K_ATP channels
  - Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP)
  - Calcium reduction (Ca²⁺)
  - ATP preservation
  - Maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and structure
- **Concurrent Hypotheses:**
  - Hormonal
  - Immunological
  - Metabolic
  - Cytokines
  - Immunological and neutrophil attenuation
  - Metabolic changes
  - Reduced apoptosis
  - Gap junction control
- **Cellular Effects within the Mitochondria:**
  - Ca²⁺ homeostasis
  - Improved oxygen utilization
  - ATP preservation
- **Gene Transcription and Expression:**
  - Late phase effects

### Relevance to Anaesthesiologists

**Benefits of Volatile Agents in Preconditioning Protocols (Compared to Total Intravenous Anaesthesia):**
- Reduction in CK-MB and cTnI release post-ischemia, thus reducing myocardial damage.
- Preservation of global hemodynamic and left ventricular function.
- Shorter ICU and total hospital stays.
- Faster weaning from mechanical ventilation.
- Trend towards reduced myocardial infarction and death.
- Reduced incidence of long-term cardiac events.

#### Mechanism by Which Volatiles Assist with Preconditioning
1. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance, thus reducing myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO₂).
2. Direct vasodilation.
3. Anti-platelet effects.
4. Anti-dysrhythmic effects during reperfusion.
5. Aiding the recovery of stunned myocardium.

### Propofol and Volatiles
- **Propofol:** Acts as a free radical scavenger and L-type calcium channel antagonist. Enhances mechanical recovery and tissue ATP even after cardiac ischemia and reperfusion.
- **Volatiles:** Share similar mechanisms of anesthetic preconditioning as ischemic preconditioning.
- **Propofol** may be more beneficial in patients with ischemia due to its alternative method of cardioprotection, whereas **volatiles** are superior in patients with little or no preoperative ischemia.

## Protective Measures

### Clinical Evidence for the Benefits of Anaesthetic Preconditioning

**Surgical Groups Studied:**
- Off-pump CABG
- On-pump CABG
- Non-coronary graft cardiac surgery
- Paediatric cardiac surgery

**Biochemical Markers:**
- Reduction in myocardial lactate, troponin I, CK-MB, BNP, and free radical production.

**Cardiac Output Monitoring and Echocardiographic:**
- Transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed reduced wall akinesis.
- Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) indicated better left ventricular function.
- Improved oxygen utilization and cardiac indices.

**Clinical:**
- Reduced inotrope requirement.
- Reduced ventilated time.
- Reduced incidence of MI.
- Reduced hospital and ICU stay.
- No mortality data available yet.

**NB: All the above apply to non-cardiac surgery only!**  
*POISE-3 is investigating whether a MAP cutoff of 80 mmHg is superior to 65 mmHg.
