### Notes
- <sup>a</sup>: Consider reprogramming if patient is pacemaker dependent; postoperative pacemaker check required if reprogrammed.
- <sup>b</sup>: Consider reprogramming if patient is pacemaker dependent; interrogate pacemaker within 1 month after procedure.
- <sup>c</sup>: Deactivate implantable cardioverter-defibrillators peri-operatively and reactivate postoperatively; carry out checks after procedure.

# Essentials

### Classification
- Temporary: Transcutaneous / Epicardial / Transvenous
- Permanent: Placement of ≥ 1 electrode(s) in ≥ 1 chamber(s)
- Pacing: Single Chamber / Dual chamber / Rate Responsive

### Rate Modulation
- Pacemaker senses patient activity and adjusts the pacing rate to meet metabolic requirements
- Rate is increased in response to (i) Motion detected by an accelerometer and/or (ii) Minute Ventilation detected by Thoracic Impedance
- Anaesthesia: Sensors will adjust rate acc to ventilation and/or motion or interference - so RM must be disabled
### Pacemaker Code System

| **I**               | **II**              | **III**                 | **IV**                  | **VI**               |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Chamber Paced**   | **Chamber Sensed**  | **Response to Sensing** | **Rate Responsiveness** | **Multisite Pacing** |
| 0 = none            | 0 = none            | 0 = none                | 0 = none                | 0 = none             |
| A = atrium          | A = atrium          | T = triggered           | R = rate modulation     | A = atrium           |
| V = ventricle       | V = ventricle       | I = inhibited           |                         | V = ventricle        |
| D = dual (A+V)      | D = dual (A+V)      | D = dual (T+I)          |                         | D = dual (A+V)       |
| S = single (A or V) | S = single (A or V) |                         |                         |                      |

**DDD** (synchronous): Ensures coordination between atria and ventricles if one or both are initiating an impulse.

- Four rhythms possible: 1. NSR 2. Atrial sensed, ventricle paced 3. Atrial paced, ventricle sensed 4. Atrial and ventricular pacing
- Ensures that atrial events are followed by ventricular contraction, but inhibits itself if a native QRS is detected. Also ensures that an atrial contraction occurs, thus its advantage over VDD is that it guarantees atrial kick.
### Generic Defibrillator Code (NBD): NASPE/BPEG

| **Position I**       | **Position II**                       | **Position III**          | **Position IV**                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Shock Chamber(s)** | **Antitachycardia Pacing Chamber(s)** | **Tachycardia Detection** | **Antibradycardia Pacing Chamber(s)** |
| O = None             | O = None                              | E = Electrogram           | O = None                              |
| A = Atrium           | A = Atrium                            | H = Hemodynamic           | A = Atrium                            |
| V = Ventricle        | V = Ventricle                         |                           | V = Ventricle                         |
| D = Dual (A+V)       | D = Dual (A+V)                        |                           | D = Dual (A+V)                        |

Position IV is expanded to the full pacemaker coding e.g. VVE-DDDRV

### Absolute Indications for Pacemaker

- Sick sinus syndrome
- Symptomatic sinus bradycardia
- Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome
- Atrial fibrillation with sinus node dysfunction
- Complete atrioventricular block (third-degree block)
- Chronotropic incompetence
- Prolonged QT syndrome
- Cardiac resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing

### Unipolar Vs Bipolar Diathermy

- **Bipolar**: Greater risk for electromagnetic interference (the box makes up part of the circuit).
- **Unipolar**: Current runs from the tip and back to the tip of the lead (less risk of electromagnetic interference).

### Rough Guideline to the Choice of Pacing Mode

### Rate Responsive Pacemaker

1. **Definition**: Rate responsiveness.
2. **Benefit**: The ability to increase heart rate in response to motion or sensed physiological exertion.
3. **Anaesthesia Considerations**: Excessive pacing rates may be triggered by increased respiratory rate, increased tidal volume, electrocautery, and patient movement.

## Pacemaker and ICD

### Pacemaker

![](Pasted%20image%2020240224112423.png)

### Radiographic ID

- Smaller generator
- Discreet right ventricular lead (stable diameter)
- With or without right atrial lead or coronary sinus lead

### Indications

- Patients with symptomatic sinus node dysfunction and bradycardia
- Patients with complete AV block (symptoms less relevant)
- Hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome and neurocardiogenic syncope

### Effect of Magnet

- Suspends sensing of intrinsic rhythm.
- Pacing in an asynchronous mode: the rate depends on the manufacturer and the battery life; if the battery life is low, the rate may not be adequate for surgery.
- Turns off “rate response.”

### Other Effects

#### Electrocautery

- Faulty sensing of intrinsic activity causing inappropriate inhibition of pacemaker activity
	- More prominent with monopolar cautery
	- More likely with above-the-waist surgery
- Possible device reset or damage to the generator, or the leads, but unlikely

#### Radiation Therapy

- Possible device reset when performed near the device

#### Radiofrequency

- Electrocautery-like electromagnetic interference that could cause inappropriate inhibition of pacemaker activity, which is more likely with procedures above the waist
- Possible device reset or damage to the generator, or the leads, but unlikely
### ICD

![](Pasted%20image%2020240224112447.png)

### Radiographic ID

- Larger generator
- Prominent right ventricular lead, also known as shock coils. They appear as two metallic segments along the length of the ICD lead.

### Indications

- Patients at risk of sudden cardiac death: Prior ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, low ejection fraction
- Long QT syndrome
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia
- Cardiac transplantation
- Primary electrical disease: idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia

#### Anesthesia for Brugada Syndrome

- Requires ICD
- Intraoperative considerations:
	- Turn off ICD; use ECG monitoring and pacing pads
	- Monitor electrolytes and maintain normal levels
	- Maintain normothermia
	- Avoid or cautiously perform vagotonic procedures (e.g., pneumoperitoneum)
	- Avoid propofol infusions (bolus can be used), local anesthetics, and alpha-2 agonists. Ketamine and etomidate may also increase ST segment elevation.
	- Monitor for at least 36 hours in a high-care unit.
	- Monitor for VT/VF intraoperatively: If it occurs:
		- Perform defibrillation
		- Administer isoprenaline infusion if an arrhythmogenic storm occurs (>2 episodes of VT/VF in 24 hours)
		- Check electrolytes and address reversible causes
		- Quinidine can also be used orally
		- Remove triggering drugs

### Effects of Magnet

- Varies depending on device, manufacturer, and programming.
- Generally turns off detection of tachycardia and tachycardia therapy (discharge and pacing).
- Typically has no effect on the pacemaker (pacing will not become asynchronous).
- For pacemaker-dependent patients, it is best to reprogram the device to address both tachycardia and bradycardia therapy due to the risk of electrical interference and pacemaker malfunction.

### Other Effects

#### Electrocautery

- Faulty sensing of intrinsic activity causing inappropriate sensing of arrhythmias
	- More prominent with monopolar cautery
- Possible device reset or damage to the generator or leads, but unlikely

#### Radiation Therapy

- Possible device reset when performed near the device

#### Radiofrequency

- Electrocautery-like electromagnetic interference that could cause inappropriate arrhythmia sensing inhibition
- Possible device reset or damage to the generator or leads, but unlikely

### The Radiographic Image of a BiV ICD

![](Pasted%20image%2020240224112509.png)

### Radiographic ID

- Larger generator
- Prominent right ventricular lead (shock coils)
- Right atrium lead
- Coronary sinus lead

### Indications

- Treatment of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure with prolonged ventricular conduction and heart failure symptoms.
- Required ventricular pacing and low ejection fraction (EF):
	- Right ventricular (RV) pacing in patients with low EF increases CHF admissions and mortality.
- Cardiac resynchronization therapy:
	- Improves exercise tolerance and mortality.
	- Continuous pacing provides better hemodynamic stability.

### Why Would a Patient Become Pulseless with a Magnet?

- Most likely, the patient has a BiV ICD and low EF and is pacemaker-dependent.
- The device functioned appropriately with the magnet, which suspended tachyarrhythmia detection.
- Pacing was inhibited by the prolonged use of electrocautery.
- Pacing returns to an unresponsive myocardium after a prolonged period of asystole, which might have led to PEA arrest.
