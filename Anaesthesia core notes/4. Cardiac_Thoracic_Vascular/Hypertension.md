# Introduction
## Definition
- National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as a measurement of 140/90 mm Hg or higher in clinic, with subsequent ambulatory or home measurement of 135/85 mm Hg or higher
- The classification of hypertension is based on the average of two or more stable readings of arterial pressure, taken at two or more visits after initial screening, and not on a single isolated recording.
## Classification of Hypertension

### Classification According to South African Hypertension Society

|Category|Systolic Arterial Blood Pressure (SBP)|Diastolic Arterial Blood Pressure (DBP)|
|---|---|---|
|**Optimal**|<120|and <80|
|**Normal**|<130|and <85|
|**High normal**|130-139|or 85-89|
|**Hypertension**|||
|Stage 1: Mild|140-159|or 90-99|
|Stage 2: Moderate|160-179|or 100-109|
|Stage 3: Severe|180-209|or 110-119|
|Stage 4: Very severe|>210|or >120|
|**Isolated systolic hypertension**|>140|and <90|
|**Pulse pressure hypertension**|>80||

### Classification According to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association

|Category|Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)|Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)|
|---|---|---|
|**Normal**|<120 mmHg|and <80 mmHg|
|**Elevated**|120-129 mmHg|and <80 mmHg|
|**Hypertension**|||
|Stage 1|130-139 mmHg|or 80-89 mmHg|
|Stage 2|≥140 mmHg|or ≥90 mmHg|

#### Note

- The South African Hypertension Society recognizes up to Stage 3 and 4, but other grades are useful for perioperative decisions.
- An individual with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in two different categories should be assigned to the higher category.

### Pathophysiology
#### Chronic Hypertension
- **Definition:** Long-term Blood Pressure (BP) ≥135/85 (ambulatory or home blood pressure measurement) in patients without diabetes, or BP ≥130/80 in patients with diabetes.

### Mechanisms and Effects
#### Increased Afterload
- **Resistance to Left Ventricle Ejection:**
  - To overcome resistance and preserve cardiac output, the myocardium undergoes structural and functional changes.
  - This leads to left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, resulting in a stiff ventricle.

#### Decreased Contractility
- **Impaired Forward Flow:**
  - Decreased contractility of the left ventricle impairs the forward flow of blood from the heart.
  - This causes blood to back up into the lungs, leading to congestive heart failure.

#### Endothelial Dysfunction
- **Atherosclerosis:**
  - Chronic stress on the endothelium of systemic blood vessels leads to endothelial dysfunction.
  - **Accumulation of Plaques:**
	- In the walls of cerebral arteries, leading to ischemic stroke.
	- In the walls of coronary arteries, causing coronary artery disease with oxygen supply-demand mismatch, leading to myocardial infarction.

#### Hypertensive Renal Injury
- **Renal Circulation:**
  - Increased blood pressure in the renal circulation.
  - Smooth muscle of the kidney’s afferent arterioles constricts to prevent the transmission of increased blood pressure to the glomerulus.
  - Chronic stress and trauma lead to injury and excretion of cytokines and extracellular matrix into the subendothelial layer.
  - This results in the thickening of the arteriolar wall and narrowing of afferent arterioles, causing decreased glomerular blood flow, glomerular and tubular ischemia, and subsequent glomerular sclerosis and tubular atrophy, known as hypertensive nephrosclerosis.

#### Cerebral Effects
- **Intracerebral Hemorrhage:**
  - Loss of normal arterial architecture in the brain due to stress from increased blood pressure.
  - Weakening of cerebral arteries, formation, and rupture of microaneurysms lead to intracerebral hemorrhage.

### SA Guideline 2023
 **Hypertension**:
	- Urgent surgery: Appropriate anesthetic technique to control BP instability -> Proceed to surgery.
	- Elective surgery: Symptomatic vs. Asymptomatic.
		- **Symptomatic**: Investigate for end-organ disease.
		- **Asymptomatic**: SBP <180 or PP >80.
			- **SBP <180**: Proceed to surgery with appropriate anesthetic technique.
			- **SBP >180 or PP >80**: Investigate for end-organ disease -> Optimize medical management -> Proceed to surgery with appropriate anesthetic technique.

**Routine Investigations**: ECG, U&E, urinalysis, especially in diabetics.
