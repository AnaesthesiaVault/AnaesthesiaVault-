# Bronchopleural Fistula

- **Etiology of Bronchopleural Fistula (BPF) & Associated Urgency:**
	
	- Trauma, empyema/abscess, bullous disease, post lung resection, carcinoma
- **Comorbid Disease:**
	
	- Chronic obstructive lung disease, malignancy, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias
- **Absolute Indication for Lung Separation:**
	- Protection of healthy lung from soiling
	- Ineffective ventilation (with chest tube in place)
	- Tension pneumothorax (without chest tube in place)
	- Systemic air embolus
- **Repeat Thoracotomy Considerations:**
	
	- Hemorrhage
	- Sepsis, septic shock
	- Postoperative analgesia
	- Postoperative ICU disposition for positive pressure ventilation (PPV)
### Complications of IPPV in BPF

### Size of Fistula Estimation

- Indication via mechanism of injury 
- Excessive bubbling in underwater drain
- Respiratory distress & variation in tidal volume (TV) during inspiration and expiration
- Chest X-ray: Lung collapse despite drain insertion 
- CT scan: Visualization of fistula size

## Goals & Conflicts

- **Lung Isolation Prior to PPV:**
	
	- Prevent pathophysiological complications
	- Challenges: full stomach, difficult airway, hemodynamic instability, limited functional reserve
- **Rapid Sequence Lung Isolation Techniques:**
	
	- Regional anesthesia
	- Awake fibreoptic intubation: single lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) ± bronchial blocker, double lumen ETT prior to general anesthesia (GA)
	- Asleep intubation with spontaneous ventilation prior to isolation
	- Modified rapid sequence induction (RSI) with no or limited PPV prior to lung isolation
	- Double lumen ETT preferred to bronchial blocker for optimal suctioning, ventilation, and isolation
- **Need for Resuscitation & Stabilization Prior to OR:**
	
	- Fluids, vasopressors, antibiotics, chest tube placement
	- Immediate availability of thoracic surgeon for chest tube placement if not in place prior to OR
- **Intraoperative Goals:**
	
	- Lung protective ventilation
	- Restrictive fluid strategy
	- Maintenance of normothermia & normal metabolic parameters
- **Optimization for Postoperative Extubation:**
	
	- Resuscitation
	- Bronchial suctioning
	- Bronchodilators
	- Extubation to BiPAP

## Induction

- **Small Fistula:**
	
	- Conventional induction
- **Large Fistula:**
	
	- Spontaneous respiration (gas induction or awake intubation)
	- Position patient with "fistula side down"
- **Double Lumen Tube (DLT):**
	
	- More secure but requires patient to be asleep during intubation
- **Single Lumen Tube (SLT) & Bronchial Blocker (BB):**
	
	- Less secure but allows patient to be awake during intubation
- **Alternative Options:**
	
	- Thoracic epidural
	- Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)

## Ventilation

- **Small Fistula:**
	
	- Managed with single lumen ETT
	- Small tidal volume (TV)
	- Increased respiratory rate (RR)
	- Elimination or minimization of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
- **Large Fistula:**
	
	- May need double lumen ETT
	- Ventilation strategies for the lung with the fistula:
		- Increased RR and small TV
		- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) below critical pressure
		- High-frequency jet ventilation
