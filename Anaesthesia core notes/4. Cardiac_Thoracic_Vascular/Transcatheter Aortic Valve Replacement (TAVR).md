# Overview
- **TAVR** is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the aortic valve in patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at high risk for open-heart surgery.
- **Guidelines**:
  - **Class 1 (A) Recommendation**: For inoperable and high-risk patients.
  - **Class IIa (B) Recommendation**: For intermediate-risk patients.
- **Access Sites**: The heart is accessed via the femoral, subclavian, or direct aortic arteries.

## Procedure
- **Valve Deployment**: The bioprosthetic valve is threaded through a catheter and positioned within the diseased native valve using imaging guidance. Rapid pacing via a transvenous pacer may be used to stabilize the heart during deployment.
- **Completion**: The valve is fully expanded, replacing the function of the native valve.

## Indications for TAVR
- **Preoperative Assessment**: Patients are evaluated by a multidisciplinary team using a combination of medical history, physical examination, and imaging studies (TTE, TEE, cardiac catheterization, and cardiac CT).
- **Patient Selection**:
  - TAVR is indicated for patients considered "too high risk to operate" by two independent cardiac surgeons.
  - High-risk patients typically have:
	- **STS Risk Score** >10%.
	- **EuroSCORE II** >20%.
  - **Ongoing Trials**: Indications may expand to include low-risk patients.

## Complications and Management

| **Complication**                    | **Management**                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Coronary Artery Occlusion**       | Maintain MAP >70 mm Hg; IABP placement; coronary stenting may be necessary.                    |
| **Post-Procedural Aortic Stenosis** | Deployment of additional valve using "valve-in-valve" technique.                                |
| **Paravalvular Leak**               | Balloon aortic valvuloplasty; valve-in-valve technique.                                         |
| **Post-Procedural AV Block**        | Continue transvenous pacing postoperatively; permanent pacemaker placement may be required.     |

## Anesthetic Considerations
- **Anesthesia Types**:
  - **General Anesthesia**: Preferred for non-femoral access and when TEE is anticipated for valve evaluation.
  - **MAC Anesthesia**: Increasingly used for femoral access TAVR; TTE is used intraoperatively for valve assessment.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Standard ASA monitors, large-bore peripheral access, arterial line, and central access (often placed by the cardiologist).
  - Transcutaneous pacing pads due to the risk of arrhythmias during device deployment.
- **Anticoagulation**:
  - Heparin is administered before valve deployment, with ACT monitoring to ensure adequate anticoagulation.

# MitraClip™ Procedure

## Overview
- **MitraClip™** is a percutaneous procedure used to treat mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients who are not candidates for surgery or who have symptomatic heart failure despite medical therapy.
- **Procedure**:
  - A clip is used to secure the mitral leaflets, introduced via the right femoral vein with transseptal puncture to access the left atrium.
  - The resulting iatrogenic atrial septal defect (iASD) is usually left open, though its long-term consequences are not fully understood.

## Anesthetic Considerations
- **General Anesthesia**: Necessary for TEE guidance during septal puncture and accurate clip placement.
- **Monitoring**: Invasive blood pressure monitoring and central venous access are required.

## Complications
- **iASD**:
  - Often not clinically significant and may even relieve left atrial pressure.
  - However, significant bidirectional shunting may worsen clinical outcomes, making percutaneous closure of iASD desirable in select cases.
- **Post-Procedural Mitral Stenosis**:
  - Accurate patient selection and valve imaging (3D TEE) are critical to avoid iatrogenic mitral stenosis.
  - **Treatment**: Surgery is required if severe mitral stenosis occurs due to the MitraClip™ device.
