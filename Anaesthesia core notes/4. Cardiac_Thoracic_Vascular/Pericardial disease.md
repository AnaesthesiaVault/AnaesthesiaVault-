# Anatomy and Physiology of the Pericardium

- **Composition**:
  - **Layers**:
	- **Inner Visceral Layer**: Thin, adherent to, and continuous with the epicardium of the heart.
	- **Outer Parietal Layer**: Thicker and more fibrous.
  - **Thickness**:
	- Normal pericardial thickness: 1–2 mm.
- **Pericardial Fluid**:
	  - **Volume**: Normal = 15–50 ml.
	  - **Production**: By visceral mesothelial cells.
	  - **Drainage**: Via the lymphatic system into the right side of the heart.
 - **Function**:
	- Minimizes friction on the epicardium during heart movements.
	- Balances hydrostatic pressures over the heart surface.
- **Pericardial Sinuses**:
  - **Oblique Sinus**: Located posteriorly between the left atrium and pulmonary veins.
  - **Transverse Sinus**: Located behind the left atrium, behind the aorta, and pulmonary artery.
- **Physiological Benefits**:
  - Stabilizes the heart in its anatomical position.
  - Limits excessive movement within the chest cavity.
  - Prevents acute distention of cardiac chambers.
  - Optimizes atrial and ventricular coupling and filling.
  - Acts as a barrier against the spread of infection or neoplasm.
  - Secretes prostaglandins that regulate autonomic cardiac reflexes, myocardial contractile function, and coronary artery tone.

# Pathology of the Pericardium

## Congenital Defects

- **Associations**:
  - Often associated with other cardiac, pulmonary, and skeletal abnormalities.
  - Incidence: 1 in 10,000 (usually found at autopsy).
- **Types**:
  - **Partial Absence**:
	- More common on the left side (70%) than the right side (17%).
	- **Left-sided Defects**: Predispose to herniation of the heart, which can become hemodynamically significant during anesthesia induction or cause prolonged ischemia.
	- **Right-sided Defects**: May cause significant compression of the vena cava.
  - **Total Absence**:
	- Rare.
	- Excessive cardiac motion and displacement increase the risk of traumatic aortic dissection.

## Acute Pericarditis

### Etiology
- **Infectious**:
  - Viral (Coxsackie B), bacterial, mycobacterial (tuberculosis).
- **Non-infectious**:
  - Post-cardiac surgery, trauma, malignancy, acute myocardial infarction, post-acute MI (Dressler’s syndrome), uremia (renal failure), or post-radiation.
- **Auto-immune**:
  - Rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or drug-induced (procainamide, dantrolene, heparin, warfarin).

### Symptoms
- Sharp left precordial or retrosternal chest pain, pleuritic in nature, varying with posture (decreased on sitting, increased on lying supine), may radiate to the trapezius ridge.
- Prodromal symptoms of malaise, fever, and generalized myalgia.
- Tachycardia and tachypnea are usually out of proportion to the low-grade fever.
- Triphasic friction rub (atrial systole, ventricular systole, and early diastole).

### Differentials
- Acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism.

### Complications
- May develop pericardial effusion and/or tamponade.

### Risk Factors for Complications
- Bacterial or fungal infections, malignancies, end-stage renal disease, post-cardiac surgery.

### Special Investigations
- **ECG**: Sinus tachycardia, PR depression, diffuse concave upward ST-segment elevation.
- **ECHO**: May show effusion and tamponade if present, other cardiac or para-cardiac disease.

### Treatment
- **Symptomatic**:
  - NSAIDs, colchicine to prevent recurrence.
  - Low-dose corticosteroids if associated with autoimmune disease.

## Chronic Pericarditis

- Management depends on hemodynamic influence.
- Differentiate between chronic pericarditis, relapsing disease, and chronic pericardial effusion.
- Symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids before elective surgery.
- Pericardiectomy is indicated for severe, unresponsive symptoms.
- Moderate to large effusions (>10 mm separation during diastole) should be drained before elective surgery.

## Pericardial Effusion & Tamponade

### Etiology
- **Systemic Inflammatory Disease**: SLE, RA.
- **Infection**: Bacterial, viral, fungal.
- **LV/RV Free Wall Rupture; Aortic Dissection**.
- **Drugs/Toxins/Uremia/Radiation**.
- **Post-Myocardial Infarction**.
- **Trauma**.
- **Malignancy**.
- **Congestive Heart Failure; Pulmonary Hypertension; Cirrhosis**:
  - ↑ Capillary hydrostatic pressure; fluid transudate (serous).
- **Nephrotic Syndrome (rare)**:
  - Usually exudative secondary to inflammation.
### Pericardial Effusion
- **Fluid Accumulation**:
  - Gradual accumulation is better tolerated.
  - Rapid accumulation of low volumes or slow accumulation of high volumes.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Asymptomatic.
  - Sharp pain (↑ while supine/with inspiration).
  - Dull chest pain.
  - Dysphagia, dyspnea, hoarse voice (if size compresses esophagus, lungs, or recurrent laryngeal nerve).
- **Signs**:
  - Elevated intra-cardiac pressures on cardiac catheterization.
  - ↓ ECG Voltages.
  - Soft S1/S2.
  - Cardiomegaly on chest X-ray.
  - Hypo-echoic area surrounding chambers on Echo.
  - ↑ JVP/Pedal Edema/Liver Size.
  - Hypotension.
  - Dyspnea/Crackles on respiratory auscultation.
  - **Beck's Triad for Tamponade**:
	- Hypotension.
	- Jugular Venous Distension.
	- Muffled heart sounds.
### Cardiac Tamponade
- **Mechanism**:
  - Fixed ventricular volume with physiologic shift of septum toward LV with inspiration; ↓ LV filling.
  - Chamber compression severely affects cardiac output.
- **Clinical Findings**:
  - "Pulsus Paradoxus" (exaggerated >10 mmHg drop of BP with inspiration).
  - Impaired filling of the right heart:
	- Venous congestion.
	- Impaired right heart output.
  - Impaired filling of the left heart:
	- ↑ Left Ventricular End Diastolic Pressure.
	- ↓ Left heart output.
- **Outcome**:
  - Shock/Death if untreated.

### Notable Points
- **Normal Pericardial Fluid Volume**: 15-50 cc.
- **Effusion Types**: Transudative, exudative, hemorrhagic, purulent.
- **Causes**:
  - Idiopathic, iatrogenic, trauma, malignancy, end-stage renal disease, autoimmune, infectious (TB), aortic dissection, radiation.
- **Tamponade Risk**:
  - Iatrogenic (post-cardiac surgery or intervention, pacemaker insertion, valve repair).
  - Chest trauma.
  - Malignancy.
  - End-stage renal disease:
	- Pericarditis and effusions common.
	- Uremic pericarditis responds to aggressive dialysis.
	- Dialysis pericarditis often requires drainage.
	- Chronic disease and hypertension reduce risk of significant hemodynamic compromise.

### Pathogenesis
- **Inflammatory Cells**: Target and collect within the pericardium.
- **Direct Addition of Blood**: To the pericardial space.
- **Direct Irritation of the Pericardium**: Pericarditis.
- **Altered Starling Forces**: Fluid accumulates in pericardium.
#### Hemodynamic Effects
  - Dependent on fluid accumulation rate, total volume, fluid type, and pericardial compliance.
  - Acute effusions exceed pericardial compliance quickly, leading to rapid pressure increases and tamponade.
  - Chronic effusions allow for pericardial stretch and compensatory mechanisms, slowing pressure rise despite large fluid volumes.
##### Cardiac Tamponade and Pericardial Pressure-Volume Curves

Cardiac tamponade occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, leading to increased pressure on the heart. This pressure impedes the heart's ability to fill and pump blood effectively. The dynamics of this process can be illustrated through pericardial pressure-volume curves, which show how the pressure within the pericardium changes as fluid volume increases.

###### Rapid Fluid Accumulation

- When pericardial fluid increases rapidly, the pericardium quickly reaches its reserve volume capacity, depicted as the initial flat segment of the curve.
- Once this limit is exceeded, the parietal pericardium (outer layer of the pericardium) cannot stretch sufficiently to accommodate additional fluid.
- This results in a steep rise in pressure with small increases in fluid volume, indicating that the pericardium has exceeded its stretch limit.
- The disproportionate increase in pericardial pressure restricts heart expansion, leading to cardiac tamponade.

###### Slow Fluid Accumulation

- With a slower rate of fluid accumulation, the pericardium has more time to stretch and activate compensatory mechanisms.
- This slower process delays the point at which the limit of pericardial stretch is exceeded.
- As a result, the pericardial pressure increases more gradually with fluid accumulation, allowing the heart to function longer before tamponade symptoms appear.
- This gradual pressure rise provides time for the pericardium to adapt to the increasing volume, reducing the immediate impact on cardiac function.

### Overview of Management

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311153852.png)

#### Types of Drainage Procedures

##### Needle Pericardiocentesis

- Percutaneous catheter placement using Seldinger technique and imaging guidance.
- Can be performed under local anesthesia.
- Diagnostic and therapeutic but with potential complications.

##### Surgical Procedures

- **Pericardial Window**: Formation of a pleuro-pericardial window for ongoing drainage.
- **Subxiphoid Approach**: Effective and simple, can be done under local anesthesia.
- **Sternotomy or Anterolateral Thoracotomy**: For severe cases, may require cardiopulmonary bypass.

## Cardiac Tamponade

**Pathophysiology**:

- Compression of cardiac chambers due to increased intrapericardial pressures.
- Impaired filling of cardiac chambers during diastole (diastolic dysfunction).
- Elevated pericardial pressures cause compression of chambers throughout diastole.
- Unimodal venous return pattern in severe tamponade.
- Transmural pressure gradient (intrapericardial pressure - intracardiac pressure) affects chamber filling pressures.

**Pressure Effects**:

- Intracardiac pressures vary for each chamber, with right atrial pressures being the lowest.
- Increased intrapericardial pressure causes extrinsic compression of cardiac chambers.
- Right-sided filling pressures are lower than left-sided pressures, leading to right atrial and ventricular compression first.
- Decreased venous return to the right heart as right atrial pressure exceeds systemic venous return pressure.
- Impaired right ventricular filling results in reduced right ventricular stroke volume.
- Decreased pulmonary circulation flow leads to decreased left atrial and left ventricular filling.
- Equalization of left-sided pressures follows, leading to reduced cardiac output and forward blood flow.
- Exhaustive physiological compensation may lead to cardiac arrest (PEA).

**Clinical Signs and Diagnosis**:

- Symptoms: Dyspnea, orthopnea, diaphoresis, chest pain, tachycardia.
- Beck’s Triad: Muffled heart sounds, raised jugular venous pressure, hypotension.
- **Pulsus Paradoxus**: Exaggerated systolic blood pressure variation during spontaneous ventilation.
	- Caused by increased right ventricular filling during inspiration, leading to decreased left ventricular filling and systolic blood pressure.
	- Not specific to tamponade; may occur in other conditions or be absent in tamponade.
- **Differential Diagnosis of Pulsus Paradoxus**: Severe COPD, asthma, severe bronchospasm, hypovolemia, CHF, obesity.

**Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV) Effects**:

- Increased intrathoracic pressure compresses pulmonary capillaries, increasing right ventricular afterload.
- Augments left ventricular preload by squeezing blood into the left atrium.
- Enhances left ventricular systolic function, increasing systolic blood pressure.
- Decreased venous return and increased right ventricular afterload can compromise cardiac function in tamponade patients.

### Special Investigations

- **Chest X-ray**: Enlarged cardiac shadow, widened mediastinum, right costo-phrenic angle < 90 degrees, possible pleural effusion.
- **ECG**: Sinus tachycardia, low QRS and T wave voltages, PR segment depression, non-specific ST-T changes, bundle branch block, electrical alternans.
- **Echocardiography**: Diagnostic; assesses effusion size and chamber collapse.
	- Grading: Small < 10 mm, Moderate 10–20 mm, Large > 20 mm.
	- RA collapse for >30% of cardiac cycle is highly sensitive for tamponade.
	- IVC distension indicates increased right atrial pressure.
	- Respiratory variations in tricuspid and mitral transvalvular velocities and septal shift (pulsus paradoxus).
#### Pulsed Wave Doppler Tracing in Cardiac Tamponade

![](Pasted%20image%2020240612080816.png)

- **Technique**: Pulsed wave Doppler tracing using a mid-oesophageal 4-chamber view on trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TEE).
- **Purpose**: To view trans-mitral flow velocities in a spontaneously breathing patient with tamponade.
- **Finding**: Reduction in velocities during inspiration, highlighting pulsus paradoxus.
#### Cardiac Catheterization in Cardiac Tamponade
**Overview**:
- Cardiac catheterization is generally not performed as a diagnostic tool for tamponade because echocardiography is less invasive and provides sufficient diagnostic information.

**Key Hemodynamic Findings**:

- **Blunted Y Descent**: Observed in the central venous pressure (CVP) tracing.
	- **Y Descent**: Occurs after the V wave on the CVP tracing and indicates the opening of the tricuspid valve.
	- Reflects early diastolic filling of the right ventricle (RV).
	- **Blunted Y Descent**: In cardiac tamponade, the rapid equalization of pressures between the right atrium and ventricle leads to ineffective filling of the RV during early diastole.
#### Central Venous Pressure (CVP) Tracing

- **V Wave**: Represents venous filling of the right atrium.
- **Y Descent**: Indicates the drop in right atrial pressure as the tricuspid valve opens and blood flows into the right ventricle.
- **Blunted Y Descent in Tamponade**:
	- Due to the increased intrapericardial pressure, which quickly equalizes with the right atrial pressure, limiting the effective filling of the RV.
	- Results in a less pronounced drop in pressure (blunted descent) on the CVP tracing
##### Clinical Significance
- **Blunted Y Descent**: Suggestive of cardiac tamponade, indicating impaired ventricular filling.
- **Echocardiography**: Preferred for diagnosing cardiac tamponade due to its non-invasive nature and detailed visualization of cardiac structures and hemodynamics.

### Anaesthesia for Tamponade

![](Pasted%20image%2020240619141759.png)

## Constrictive Pericarditis

**Definition**:

- Chronic inflammation of the pericardium causes it to thicken, become non-compliant, and rigid, restricting cardiac chamber expansion during diastole, leading to impaired cardiac filling and diastolic dysfunction.

**Causes**:

- Idiopathic, infectious, post-cardiac surgery, following radiation to the mediastinum, trauma, or autoimmune diseases.

### Pathophysiology

- **Normal Pericardium**: Accommodates changes in cardiac volume.
	
- **Thickened, Calcified Pericardium**:
	
	- Limits cardiac chamber expansion.
	- Early diastolic filling is initially unaffected.
	- Atrial contribution to ventricular filling is mostly impeded during midto late diastole.
	- Leads to a fixed stroke volume state, requiring an increased heart rate to meet tissue perfusion demands.
- **Intrathoracic Pressure Changes**:
	
	- Not transmitted to the heart, leading to the absence of normal inspiratory augmentation of venous return to the right heart.
	- Results in an inspiratory increase in CVP (Kussmaul’s sign).
- **Respiratory Variation**:
	
	- Pulmonary veins lie outside the pericardium; changes in intrathoracic pressures affect pulmonary vein flow.
	- Negative pressure ventilation reduces LV filling and systolic blood pressure but does not typically cause pulsus paradoxus.
- **Ventricular Interdependence**:
	
	- Pressure changes in one ventricle are transferred to the other, leading to equilibration of diastolic pressures.
	- Small septal shifts have minimal effect on filling due to high baseline diastolic pressures.
- **Myocardial Atrophy**:
	
	- Chronic constriction can cause myocardial atrophy, leading to continued diastolic and significant systolic dysfunction, even after pericardiectomy.

### Clinical Signs and Diagnosis

- **Symptoms**:
	- Similar to right ventricular failure: Tachycardia, fluid overload, decreased cardiac output, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
	- Ascites, hepatomegaly, pleural effusion, peripheral edema, cachexia.
	- **Pericardial Knock**: High-pitched sound in early diastole.
	- **Kussmaul’s Sign**: Increase in jugular venous pressure on inspiration.
- **Differential Diagnosis**:
	- Restrictive cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolus, right ventricular infarction, pleural effusion, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Special Investigations

- **Chest X-ray**:
	
	- Ring of calcification around the heart, possible cardiomegaly if associated with effusion.
- **ECG**:
	
	- Low voltages, non-specific ST-T changes, atrial fibrillation, P mitrale.
- **CT Scan and MRI**:
	
	- Confirm pericardial thickening and calcification.
- **Echocardiography**:
	
	- Increased pericardial thickness (>2mm), inspiratory posterior motion of the septum in diastole, nonpulsatile dilated IVC.
	- **Pulsed Wave Doppler (PWD)**: Specific trans-mitral flow velocity pattern.
- **Cardiac Catheterization**:
	
	- **RV Trace**: Square root sign, rapid drop in RV pressure in early diastole ("dip") followed by a plateau.

### Differentiating Constrictive Pericarditis (CP) from Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RC)

- **CP**:
	
	- Uncoupling of intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures.
	- Increased ventricular interdependence.
	- Normal E wave velocities on ECHO indicating preserved elastic recoil and compliance of the LV.
	- Respiratory variation in pulmonary vein flow.
- **RC**:
	
	- Intrinsic myocardial disease with impaired relaxation and reduced compliance.
	- Reduced E wave velocities due to impaired myocardial function.
	- No respiratory variation in pulmonary vein flow.

### Treatment
- Medical management consists of diuretics, digoxin and betablockers to decrease venous congestion and tachyarrhythmias preoperatively.
- Anti-TB treatment is required for a minimum of 2 months before surgery in the case of TB pericarditis.
# Anaesthesia for Pericardiectomy

## Overview

Pericardiectomy with complete decortication is the definitive treatment for established constrictive pericarditis. The perioperative management is complex and requires meticulous planning and monitoring due to the significant risks involved.

### Surgical Approach
- Pericardial stripping is typically performed via sternotomy or lateral thoracotomy.
- Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) support may be used depending on the patient's preoperative condition and intraoperative complications.

### Mortality and Risks
- Perioperative mortality is highly dependent on the preoperative New York Heart Association (NYHA) status.
- The operation carries significant risks, including:
  - Massive hemorrhage.
  - Damage to the epicardium, myocardium, and coronary vessels.
  - Persistent constrictive physiology and abnormal diastolic filling patterns postoperatively.
- Overall mortality is around 12%.

## Pre-operative Assessment

### Signs & Symptoms
- Tachycardia (fixed stroke volume state)
- Fluid overload (peripheral edema → anasarca) leading to pleural effusions, ascites, hepatomegaly
- Decreased cardiac output (CO), shortness of breath (SOB), fatigue
- Pericardial knock
- Cachexia
- Kussmaul's sign (increased jugular venous pressure [JVP] on inspiration)

### Special Investigations
- **Chest X-ray (CXR)**: Calcification ring around the heart ± cardiomegaly
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: p-mitrale, upsloping ST-T waves, atrial fibrillation (AF), low voltages
- **Computed Tomography (CT) / Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: Confirm myocardial thickening and calcification
- **Echocardiography (ECHO)**: Increased E/A ratio, decreased pulmonary vein flow due to increased left atrial pressures
- **Cardiac Catheterization**: Square root sign (rapid filling and rapid drop-off)

## Anaesthetic Issues in Managing Constrictive Pericarditis for Pericardiectomy

### 1. Optimizing Medical Management
- **Medications**:
  - Diuretics, digoxin, β-blockers
  - Anti-tuberculosis (TB) treatment for at least 2 months before surgery

### 2. Haemodynamic Goals
- **Contractility**: Maintain and augment
- **Rate**: Maintain normal sinus rhythm (NSR) to preserve atrial contribution to ventricular filling
- **Afterload**: Maintain
- **Preload**: Maintain or augment, but avoid overload

### 3. Anticipate.
- **Arrhythmias**
- **Massive Hemorrhage**:
  - Massive transfusion protocol (MTP)
  - Whole blood intravenous (WBIV)
  - Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) support
  - Inotropes/pressors ready and running
- **Persistent Constrictive Physiology**:
  - May require inotropes and congestive heart failure (CCF) management even after release due to chronic changes
