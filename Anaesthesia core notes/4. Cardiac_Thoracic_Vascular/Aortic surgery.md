# Aortic Aneurism

## Definition
- **Aortic Aneurysm**:
	- Abnormal, irreversible dilation of a focal area of abdominal aorta (area of aorta between diaphragm & aortic bifurcation) to twice the diameter of adjacent normal artery segment
		- Dilatation of the aorta exceeding 50% of its normal diameter, involving all three layers of the vessel wall.
	- **Normal Diameter**: Approximately 2 cm; an aneurysm is diagnosed when the diameter reaches 3 cm.
- **Thoraco-abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)**:
	- Involves the visceral arteries, including the celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries.
	- Common Causes: Degenerative changes, Marfan syndrome.
## Classification
- **Based on Symptom Duration**:
	- **Acute**: Symptoms present for less than 2 weeks.
	- **Chronic**: Symptoms present for more than 2 weeks.
- **Stanford Classification**:
	- **Type A**: Involves the ascending aorta.
	- **Type B**: Involves the descending aorta.
- **DeBakey Classification**:
	- **Type I**: Involves the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta.
	- **Type II**: Involves the ascending aorta only.
	- **Type III**: Involves the descending aorta only.
## Clinical and Complications
### Asymptomatic, Non-Ruptured Aneurysm

1. **Detection:**
	- Only detectable on imaging or by palpation.
	- Most AAAs are asymptomatic until rupture or days before impending rupture.
### Symptomatic, Non-Ruptured Aneurysm

1. **Symptoms:**
	- Rarely causes symptoms or complications (0.1-1% of AAAs).
	- Adventitia (outermost collagen layer of the aorta) may dilate significantly.
	- Symptoms may include abdominal and/or back pain due to adventitia dilation.
### Ruptured AAA: Emergency
1. **Aorta Location:**
	- Lies between the peritoneal and retroperitoneal space.
2. **Rupture Events:**
	- **Posterior Aortic Wall Rupture:**
		- Retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
		- Space for blood to accumulate, causing rapid pressure increase in the retroperitoneal space.
		- Can act as tamponade, preventing catastrophic blood loss temporarily.
		- Compensated hypovolemic shock: low blood pressure with temporarily stopped blood loss.
	- **Anterior Aortic Wall Rupture:**
		- Peritoneal hemorrhage.
		- Massive hemorrhage due to high blood flow volume through aorta.
		- Hypotension and rapid progression to hypovolemic shock.
		- Death within minutes if untreated.
		- Blood pools in peritoneal space, causing rapid blood loss and decompensation of hypovolemic shock.
#### Complications of AAA
1. **Hypotension and Hypovolemic Shock:**
	- Rapid progression leading to organ ischemia.
	- Potential for kidney ischemia and lower limb ischemia due to thrombi dislodgement.
2. **Death:**
	- High mortality rate without timely surgical intervention.
## Pathogenesis
### Normal Layers of the Aortic Wall (longitudinal section)
- Tunica Intima (inner-most tissue layer of aorta)
- Tunica Media (layers of elastic tissue (elastin) and muscle fibers)
- Adventitia (thin outermost collagenous layer)
### Risk Factors

![](Pasted%20image%2020240614174135.png)

### Pathophysiological Mechanisms
- Immune-mediated destruction of the aorta
- Degradation of aortic connective tissue
- Biomechanical stress on vessels
#### Progression
- Loss of smooth muscle cells & thinning of tunica media
- Destruction of elastin in tunica media
- Decreased aortic tensile strength (ability to withstand stretching)
- Aorta expands and dilates due to internal pressure
#### Infrafrenal Aorta Pathophysiology
- Poorly developed vaso vasorum (dedicated blood supply to vessel wall)
- Relies solely on nutrient diffusion from aortic blood that crosses abdominal aorta
- More prone to ischemia and has impaired repair potential
- Fewer “lamellar” units (fibromuscular units) than other regions of the aorta
- Less elastic and less able to distribute stress
### Outcome
- Aortic aneurysms are usually infrafrenal (85%)

# Aortic Dissection

## Pathogenesis
 **Trauma, Hypertension, or iatrogenic manipulation** (surgery, catheter)
		- Mechanical forces damage aortic intima
**Degeneration of aortic media**
		- Breakdown of elastin layers supporting aortic intima
		- Disorders of collagen (e.g., Marfan syndrome)
		- Abnormal structures supporting aortic intima
**Mechanism**
		- Aortic intima tears → blood dissects aortic intima from the media
**Immediate Effects**
		- Blood entering the dissected aorta expands the aorta, compressing adjacent structures
		- Perturbed wall architecture decreases its mechanical strength
		- If systolic blood pressure > wall strength of aorta:
			- Rupture of aorta
			- Hemorrhage, Haemothorax, Hypovolemic shock, Death
## Dissection Pathway
**Intimal tear creates an “intimal flap” of tissue**
		- If the flap is situated beside the aortic valve, the flap will mechanically impede proper closure (coaptation) of aortic valve → **Aortic valve regurgitation**
		- The intimal flap may also block flow of blood into ostia of coronary arteries → Inadequate myocardial O₂ supply → **Cardiac ischemia**
**Dissection propagates along aortic wall**
		- **Dissection extends into pericardial sac/cavity** → Hemopericardium, Cardiac tamponade, Cardiogenic shock
		- **Extension of dissection into branches of aorta impedes blood flow to all tissues supplied by that branch (i.e., brain, gut, arms, legs)**
			- **Malperfusion syndromes** (e.g., stroke, mesenteric ischemia, shock)
				- Blood pressure difference between arms (>20mmHg)
				- Weaker pulse in one arm
				- Dizziness, Syncope, Coma
		- **Compression of nerve or ganglion leads to their dysfunction**
			- **Compression of superior cervical ganglion** → Horner’s syndrome (unilateral constricted pupil, droopy eyelid, decreased sweating)
			- **Compression of recurrent laryngeal nerve** → Hoarseness
			- **If the compressed structures are pain sensitive (pleura, peritoneum)**
				- Pain signals relayed to CNS (referral pattern depends on structures compressed)
				- **Acute onset “Ripping” chest pain** (maximum intensity at onset, radiates anywhere in thorax or abdomen)
## Goals for Dissection Diagnosis
1. Confirm diagnosis
2. Classify the dissection/delineate the extent
3. Differentiate true and false lumens
4. Localize intimal tear; intimal flap, entry sites
5. Distinguish between communicating and non-communicating dissection
6. Assess side branch involvement (i.e., coronary, carotid, subclavian, celiac, and renal arteries)
7. Detect and grade aortic regurgitation
8. Detect extravasations (peri-aortic or mediastinal hematoma, pleural or pericardial effusion, tamponade)
## Ascending Vs Descending Disease

| Descending Disease         | Left thoracotomy | Lateral           | Usually none, may be shunts or partial bypass | Variable       | Usually no active measures | Variable               |

## Conduct of Anaesthesia for an Aortic Aneurism Repair

### Initial Management of Patients with Suspected Aortic Dissection
1. **Oxygen:** Administer as needed, following ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) principles.
2. **History and Examination:** Obtain detailed medical history and conduct a thorough physical examination whenever possible.
3. **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and oxygen saturation (SpO₂).
4. **Intravenous Access and Bloods:**
	- Establish i.v. line.
	- Perform blood tests including crossmatch, creatine kinase (CK), troponin, full blood count (FBC), urea and electrolytes (U&E), myoglobin, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
5. **ECG:** Obtain a 12-lead ECG to document ischemia.
6. **Pain Relief:** Administer morphine sulphate for pain relief.
7. **Fluid Management:** Administer i.v. fluids carefully.
8. **Blood Pressure Management:**
	- Titrate BP to about 110–120 mm Hg systolic using i.v. esmolol, metoprolol, or labetalol first.
	- Use sodium nitroprusside for additional BP control if beta-blockers are contraindicated.
	- Consider calcium channel blockers if beta-blockers are not suitable.
9. **Imaging:** Perform imaging studies at the earliest opportunity.
10. **Transfer:** Transfer the patient to the theatre or regional cardiothoracic center/intensive care unit as appropriate.
### Risk Stratification

#### Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS)

- **Age of patient (points = no. of years)**: 1 point per year
- **Shock**: 17 points
- **Myocardial disease**: 7 points
  - Includes previous myocardial infarction and/or ongoing angina.
- **Cerebrovascular disease**: 10 points
  - Includes all grades of stroke, including transient ischaemic attack.
- **Renal disease**: 14 points
  - Defined as serum urea > 20 mmol/L and/or creatinine > 150 mmol/L.
  
**Total Score Calculation**:
- Age in years is added to the other variables to produce a total score.
- The best cut-off value for GAS in emergency repair is 84, indicating a mortality of 65%.

**Predictive Utility**:
- GAS is useful in predicting postoperative mortality in both elective and emergency AAA repair.
- **Postoperative mortality**:
  - Elective repair: 1.4% in patients with a GAS < 78.8; 8.7% in those with a GAS ≥ 78.8.
  - Emergency repair: 28% with a GAS < 84; 65% with a GAS ≥ 84.
#### Hardman Index
- **Age > 76**: 1 point
- **Serum creatinine > 190 µmol/L**: 1 point
- **Haemoglobin < 9 g/dL**: 1 point
- **Myocardial ischaemia on ECG**: 1 point
- **A history of loss of consciousness after arrival to hospital**: 1 point

**Total Score Calculation**:
- Each preoperative variable present is assigned 1 point, with a possible score ranging from 0 to 5.
- A total score of ≥ 2 is consistent with a mortality rate of > 80%.

**Predictive Utility**:
- Recent studies have predicted a mortality of 80% with a Hardman index score of ≥ 2.
### Preoperative Considerations
#### Personnel
- Assistance: 2 senior anaesthetists

#### Co-morbidities
- Coronary artery disease (CAD)/ischemic heart disease (IHD)
- Smoking
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Diabetes mellitus (DM)
- Hypertension (HT)

#### Hypotensive Resuscitation
- Clot formation, retroperitoneal tamponade, and hypotension may limit further hemorrhage. Fluid resuscitation may destabilize these factors.
- Maintain a minimum systolic BP (e.g., 70 mmHg) or withhold IV fluids until cerebral or myocardial ischemia occurs.

#### Equipment (Theatre Preparation)
- **Bloods and Fluids**:
  - At least 10 units of red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate.
  - Avoid clear fluids.
  - Do not transfuse preoperatively unless absolutely necessary.
  - Use cell salvage as it reduces the use of allogeneic blood in aortic surgery.
- **Warmers**:
  - Hot-air and IVI warmers are essential. Monitor intraoperative temperature.
- **IV Access**:
  - Two 14G or greater IV accesses.
- **Cell Saver**
- **Syringe Drivers**
  - At least two for inotropes, vasodilators, and epidural.
- **Rapid Infusion System**
- **A-line and CVC**
  - Triple-lumen CVP after induction.
- **Ultrasound**
- **TEG**
- **Lumbar Drain**
  - Indications include increased risk of spinal cord injury (SCI), Type 1 Crawford thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA), prior distal aortic repair.
- **Medications**:
  - Vasoconstrictors (ephedrine and metaraminol), vasodilators (GTN), and β-blockers (labetalol).
- **Analgesia**:
  - Consider preoperative epidural catheter in patients with a contained leak if coagulation results are satisfactory and the patient is hemodynamically stable.
  - Thoracic epidural (T6–T11) pre-induction.
- **PAFC Introducer**:
  - For complex cases, allows rapid fluid administration and PA catheter insertion if necessary.
- **Continuous Cardiac Output Monitoring**:
  - Useful during the cross-clamp period, especially for patients with impaired cardiac function.
  - Options include PA catheter, LiDCO™, PiCCO™, and esophageal Doppler (not accurate during aortic cross-clamping).

### Intraoperative Management
#### Airway
- Double-lumen tube (DLT), consider right-sided if left bronchial distortion on CXR.

#### Position
- Right lateral (left side up).

#### Temperature
- Permissive cooling to reduce ischemic risk.

#### Fluids
- Adequate hydration to reduce renal impairment risk post-op; use rapid infusion system.

#### IV Access
- Wide-bore peripheral venous cannulae and central venous pressure (CVP) line.

#### Blood Management
- Cell salvage, rapid infusion system, cross-matched blood in OR.

#### Monitors
- Transesophageal echocardiogram (TOE): LV function, filling, assess dissection, confirm CVP position, repair quality.
- Arterial line (A-line): Right radial (proximal aneurysm pressure), right femoral (distal perfusion).
- Point-of-care monitoring: ABG, TEG, BSL, HB, Electrolytes.
- Cerebral oximetry: If cross-clamp close to origins of the left common carotid.
- Depth of anesthesia monitoring.
- Neuromuscular transmission monitor.
- CSF drain.
- +/- Pulmonary artery catheter.

#### Induction
- Only induce when setup and hemodynamic control are assured.
- Cardiovascular collapse risk due to:
  - Cardiodepressant effects of intravenous and inhalational agents.
  - Abdominal muscle relaxation reducing tamponade effect.
  - Intermittent positive pressure ventilation reducing venous return.
  - Reduction in sympathetic tone.
- Modified RSI with careful induction, monitoring invasive arterial BP.
- Use moderate/high-dose opioid, e.g., remifentanil (0.1–0.2 µg/kg/min) or high-dose fentanyl (5–10 µg/kg).
- Treat hypotension with fluids first, then cautious vasoconstriction (metaraminol 0.25–0.5 mg).
- No difference in myocardial outcome between sevoflurane-based anesthesia and TIVA.
- Hypothermia likely unless actively managed.
  - Avoid warming blankets on lower limbs during aortic cross-clamp to prevent worsening ischemia.
- Insert urinary catheter for hourly urine output measurements.

#### Maintenance
- General anesthesia (GA) alone or GA with epidural: Pros = good analgesia, less respiratory depression; Cons = masks motor block secondary to spinal ischemia.
- Balanced technique using volatile agents/opioids and neuromuscular blockade.
- Avoid N2O.
- **Acid-Base Management**: Ischemia causes acidosis; may need bicarbonate.
- **Glucose Control**: Insulin infusion.
- **Electrolyte Management**: Monitor for hypocalcemia (citrate accumulation) and hypomagnesemia.
- **Hemodynamic Control**:
  - Maintain high upper body MAP (80-100 mmHg) for increased collateral flow to anterior spinal arteries.
  - Aim for 50 mmHg distal to cross-clamp.
  - Consider partial CPB or shunts depending on surgical site.
  - Have adrenaline, noradrenaline, dobutamine, esmolol, and GTN ready.
- **Renal and Spinal Protection**:
  - Cold perfusion of kidneys during ischemia time & CPB/shunt.
  - MEPs & SSEPs, CSF drain, permissive hypothermia, selective reimplantation of intercostal vessels.
  - Maintain MAP as above, use sequential cross-clamping techniques.

##### Spinal Cord Injury risk Factors
1. Extent of aortic disease.
2. Presence of dissection or rupture.
3. Prolonged cross-clamp duration without distal circulatory support (↑ risk after 30-50 min).

##### Renal Dysfunction Prevention
- Appropriate hydration.
- Minimize ischemia duration.
- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs.
- Selective renal perfusion via distal aortic perfusion pump.
- Infuse cold crystalloid solution (4°C) into the renal artery.
- Avoid hypotension and low CO after renal reperfusion.

##### Heparin Management
- Administer 3000–5000U just before cross-clamp.
- Reverse with protamine 0.5–1 mg per 100U of heparin IV slowly to avoid hypotension.

##### Aortic Cross-Clamp (AXC)
- Proximal hypertension due to increased SVR, SVC flow, and sympatho-adrenal response.
  - Manage with deepened anesthesia, β-blockers (labetalol 5–10 mg), GTN infusion, or epidural LA.
- Metabolic acidosis develops due to ischemic lower limbs.
  - Maintain minute ventilation to develop respiratory alkalosis, minimizing metabolic acidosis upon unclamping.
  - Check ABGs for Hct, metabolic acidosis, respiratory compensation, and ionized Ca2+.
  - Start fluid administration, aiming for moderately increased CVP (5 cmH2O above baseline) by unclamping.

##### Unclamping
- Gradual release helps CVS stability, reduces sudden hypotension, preserves renal function.
- Hypotension post-unclamping due to decreased SVR, relative hypovolemia, myocardial 'stunning.'
  - Treat with IV fluids, lighten anesthesia, small doses of inotropes (adrenaline 10 µg aliquots), calcium gluconate (up to 10 mL of 10%).
  - Use isotonic crystalloid or colloid for fluid replacement.
  - Transfuse blood products as needed (Hct < 25%, platelets < 100 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L).
- Check ACT if coagulopathy is suspected; TEG for comprehensive coagulation status.
- TOE for additional information during the cross-clamp period.

#### Special Considerations
- **Epidural Management**:
  - Bolus epidural morphine 2–3 mg at induction for 12–24 hr analgesia.
  - Use epidural LA sparingly until aorta is closed to facilitate treatment of aortic unclamping hypotension.
- **Renal Failure Risk**:
  - Occurs in 1–2% of cases, multifactorial origin, associated with 50% mortality post-AAA repair.
  - More likely if cross-clamp is suprarenal.
  - Dopamine does not prevent renal failure; acts as inotrope.
  - Mannitol (0.5 g/kg during cross-clamp) may be used as a free radical scavenger and osmotic diuretic.
  - Avoid hypovolemia, monitor urine output hourly.

##### Distal Aortic Perfusion Options
- Bypass pump commonly used except in type IV aneurysms.
- **Techniques**:
  1. **Left Heart Bypass**: Left atria to left femoral artery, no oxygenator required, heat exchanger for cooling.
  2. **Femoral-Femoral Bypass**: Femoral vein cannula to IVC, blood returned to left femoral artery, oxygenator and heat exchanger in circuit.
	- Heparinization required (ACT 200-250), less than full CPB due to antithrombotic coating and absence of reservoirs.
- Passive shunt from proximal to distal aorta.

### Postoperative Management
1. Sedation and ventilation in ICU.
2. Ensure adequate cardiac output, perfusion pressures, and O2 delivery.
3. Normothermia with active and passive rewarming.
4. Continual assessment of volume status and ensuring normovolemia.
5. Monitoring for AKI, MI, arrhythmias, and neurological injury.
6. PACU/ICU, usually intubated post-op, maintain MAP > 80 mmHg, ongoing CSF drainage for 48 hours.

#### Complications
- **Abdominal Compartment Syndrome**:
  - Risks: anemia, prolonged hypotension, CPR, hypothermia, severe acidosis (base deficit > 14 mEq), aggressive fluid resuscitation.
- **Renal Failure**
- **Spinal Cord Injury with Paralysis**

##### Paralysis Management
- Assumed delayed spinal ischemia:
  - Drain CSF to 8-12 mmHg if lumbar drain present.
  - Increase MAP by 10 mmHg every 5 minutes until weakness resolves or high MAP reached (Volume and Vasopressors).
  - If no improvement in 10 minutes, ready lumbar drain.
  - Insert lumbar drain at 20 minutes if not responding, drain to ICP of 10 mmHg.
  - If no improvement, perform CT spine to exclude hematoma.
  - Wean vasopressors as tolerated following improvement in weakness.
# Lumbar Drain

## Indications

- The decision to insert a spinal drain preoperatively should balance risks and benefits, considered by the consultant surgeon and anaesthetist.
- Preemptive insertion of a lumbar drain and maintaining CSF pressure below 10 mm Hg is recommended for:
	- Open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair.
	- High-risk thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR).
- Guidelines:
	- **European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery & European Society of Cardiology:** Recommend CSF drainage for all open TAAA repair and high-risk TEVAR.
	- **American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association:** Recommend CSF drainage for high-risk open and endovascular thoracic aortic repair.
- Prolonged postoperative ventilation is an indication for CSF drainage due to the difficulty in detecting neurological deficits.
- Emergency indication for patients showing signs of spinal cord ischemia (SCI).

## Contraindications

- **Absolute Contraindication:** Patient refusal.
- **Relative Contraindications:** Should be weighed against the individual's risk of SCI.
	- Abnormal coagulation increases the risk of neuraxial hematoma and intracranial hemorrhage.

## Aetiology of Spinal Cord Ischemia (SCI)

- **Blood Supply to the Spinal Cord:**
	- Longitudinal arteries (single anterior spinal artery and paired posterior spinal arteries) from the vertebral arteries.
	- Segmental arteries, including branches from the intercostal, lumbar, inferior mesenteric, internal iliac, and sacral arteries.
	- The artery of Adamkiewicz supplies the thoracolumbar spinal cord, typically arising from T9-12.
- **Mechanisms Contributing to SCI:**
	- Disruption of collateral blood flow during aortic clamping.
	- Increased intracranial and central venous pressure.
	- Reduced spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) due to systemic hypotension, intraoperative ischemia, and postoperative spinal cord edema.

## Insertion and Set-Up

### Equipment

- **Standard Epidural Pack:** Includes a 16G or 14G Tuohy needle with corresponding 19G or 16G catheter.
- **Catheter Types:** Standard fenestrated clear epidural catheters or silicone catheters.
- **External Drainage System Components:** Clear tubing, 3-way tap with flushless transducer, drip chamber, and collection bag.

### Technique

- **Position:** Patient can be seated or in the lateral decubitus position.
	- Seated: Easier technically but may result in greater initial CSF drainage.
	- Lateral decubitus: Suitable for anaesthetized or sedated patients.
- **Site:** Inserted at L3/4 or L4/5 level to avoid injury to the spinal cord.
- **Insertion Steps:**
	- Use loss-of-resistance technique with saline to locate the epidural space.
	- Advance the Tuohy needle into the intrathecal space until CSF flows freely.
	- Thread catheter intrathecally with 6-9 cm left inside.
	- Secure catheter with clear dressing and avoid the surgical field.
- **Precautions:** Delay heparinisation for 60 minutes if a bloody tap occurs; resite or consider postponing surgery if two bloody taps are encountered.
### Anticoagulation Management

- **Preoperative:** 60 minutes between neuraxial technique and systemic heparinisation.
- **Postoperative:** Follow institutional guidelines for timing anticoagulation around catheter removal to reduce hemorrhagic risks

## Intraoperative Management
- **Goal:** Maintain SCPP >70 mm Hg by targeting CSF pressure <10 mm Hg and MAP between 80-100 mm Hg.
- **CSF Drainage Technique:**
	- Drain in 5-10 mL increments if pressure approaches/exceeds 10 mm Hg.
	- Avoid continuous drainage to prevent subdural vein tears and intracranial hemorrhage.
	- Do not exceed drainage rate of 15 mL/h to align with normal physiological CSF turnover (10-20 mL/h).

## Postoperative Management

- **Monitoring Parameters:**
	- CSF pressure, MAP, Glasgow coma scale, pupil reactivity, lower limb power and sensation, and CSF color/volume.
- **Management of Neurological Deficit:**
	- Drain CSF freely with the patient lying flat to reduce CSF pressure <5 mm Hg.
	- Increase MAP >90 mm Hg and maintain hemoglobin >100 g/dL.
	- Consider spinal imaging if symptoms persist.
## Catheter Removal

- **Timing:** Continue drainage for at least 48 hours postoperatively due to high SCI risk in the initial 2 days.
	- Can be extended to 5 days if neurological abnormalities persist.
- **Procedure:** Some institutions advocate clamping the drain before removal to normalize CSF pressure while assessing neurological status.
- **Infection Risk:** Increases significantly beyond 5 days of drain placement.

## Complications

|Complication|Incidence (%)|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Headache|2.1-3.9|Postdural puncture headache; management includes fluid and analgesia.|
|Intracranial hemorrhage|0.3-1.5|If GCS falls or pupils become abnormal, stop drainage and perform urgent imaging.|
|CSF leak|0.9-1.1|Monitor for persistent leaks and treat appropriately.|
|Epidural hematoma|0.4-0.8|Requires immediate attention; MRI preferred if metal-free.|
|Neurological deficit|0.1-0.6|MRI should be performed for postoperative leg weakness.|
|Death|0.3|Rare but severe.|
|Drain fracture|0.1|Requires careful catheter handling.|
|Insertion site infection|0.1|Prevent with strict asepsis.|
|Meningitis|0.1|Indicated by turbid CSF, severe headache, meningism, and signs of infection.|

- **Overall Complication Rate:** 6.5%, with risk factors including wider-bore catheters, difficult insertion, and blood-tinged CSF.
## Evidence for CSF Drainage

- **Efficacy:** CSF drainage was first proposed in 1988 and has been widely adopted to prevent SCI in TAAA repairs.
- **Literature Review:**
	- Some studies support its use in reducing SCI risk, but evidence remains mixed, especially for TEVAR.
	- Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials provide limited evidence, yet it remains a recommended practice for high-risk cases.

# Emergency Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

5. **ECG:** Obtain a 12-lead ECG to document ischemia.
6. **Pain Relief:** Administer morphine sulphate for pain relief.
7. **Fluid Management:** Administer i.v. fluids carefully.
8. **Blood Pressure Management:**
	- Titrate BP to about 110–120 mm Hg systolic using i.v. esmolol, metoprolol, or labetalol first.
	- Use sodium nitroprusside for additional BP control if beta-blockers are contraindicated.
	- Consider calcium channel blockers if beta-blockers are not suitable.
9. **Imaging:** Perform imaging studies at the earliest opportunity.
10. **Transfer:** Transfer the patient to the theatre or regional cardiothoracic center/intensive care unit as appropriate.

## Overview

Emergency repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a critical anaesthetic and surgical emergency, which can present in two ways:

- **Acute**: Characterized by cardiovascular collapse. Prognosis is poor unless the rupture is contained in the retroperitoneal space.
- **Dissecting**: Dissects along the arterial intima, presenting with back or abdominal pain.

Prehospital mortality for ruptured AAA is approximately 50%, with half of those reaching the hospital also not surviving.

## Management

Management follows the protocol for elective AAA repair with specific additional considerations:

Dr. Claire Scanlon's talk titled "Practical Anesthesia Tips for Acute Aortic Dissection." 2024 [Cardiothoracic anaesthesia partners](https://cardiothoracicanaesthesia.com/)

### Key Points on Anesthesia for Acute Aortic Dissection

- **Preparation and Transfer:**
  - **Timing is unpredictable**: Always estimate patient arrival times conservatively. Confirm the actual time when a patient is en route from another hospital.
  - **Direct contact**: Provide transfer teams with your mobile number for rapid communication to avoid delays through switchboards.
  - **Transfer location**: Consider whether the patient should be received in the ICU, theater, or a resuscitation area based on their condition and institutional protocols.
  - **Communication**: Ensure all relevant personnel (surgeons, bed managers, ICU nurses) are informed and coordinated for efficient patient management.
- **Logistics and Team Coordination:**
  - **Theatre availability**: Confirm theater availability, particularly during working hours when all theaters may be occupied.
  - **Equipment readiness**: Prepare necessary equipment (e.g., Belmont infusers, depth of anesthesia monitors) before the patient arrives.
  - **Patient identification**: Ensure the patient has a valid hospital ID to avoid delays in receiving blood products or starting procedures.
- **Preoperative Patient Assessment:**
  - **Thorough review of patient history**: Always verify the information provided from other hospitals. Miscommunication can lead to inappropriate referrals or management changes.
  - **CT and Imaging Review**: Examine the extent of dissection, particularly noting vessel involvement and malperfusion risks.
  - **Echocardiography**: Perform a quick bedside echocardiogram preoperatively to assess the aortic valve and any cardiac changes since the initial assessment.
  - **Blood crossmatching**: Prioritize rapid blood crossmatch, particularly for patients needing immediate surgery.
- **Anesthetic Plan:**
  - **Blood pressure control**: Maintain systolic BP between 80-90 mmHg using agents like esmolol or sodium nitroprusside, and avoid bradycardia.
  - **Lines and vascular access**: Insert two large-bore intravenous lines and arterial lines (typically radial and femoral) before induction.
  - **Induction considerations**: Use a reduced opioid dose (especially if aortic regurgitation is present), and consider performing induction in the theater with the surgeon scrubbed in case of complications.
  - **Airway management**: Prepare for difficult airways as in other high-risk surgeries. Aim for rapid sequence intubation with rocuronium to avoid induction-related hemodynamic collapse.
- **Intraoperative Management:**
  - **Luminal identification**: Use echocardiography to confirm cannulation in the true lumen during surgery. The true lumen will fill in systole, but can be compressed by the false lumen.
  - **Bleeding and coagulation**: Prepare for coagulopathy, particularly if the patient has had previous antiplatelet therapy. Anticipate the need for blood products and consider early use of thromboelastography (TEG).
  - **Myocardial support**: Be prepared for reduced myocardial function postoperatively. ECMO or intra-aortic balloon pumps should be considered if necessary.
- **Postoperative Planning:**
  - **Post-surgery bleeding**: Have clotting products and platelets ready to manage bleeding at the end of the procedure, particularly in cases with anticoagulant or antiplatelet exposure.
  - **Mechanical circulatory support (MCS)**: Plan for post-op myocardial support, such as ECMO, if there are significant concerns regarding cardiac function after surgery.

### Specific Medications and Techniques
- **Anticoagulation management**: Ensure that heparin is ready but kept away from other medications to prevent accidental administration.
- **Cytosorb**: Consider using cytosorb for patients with recent antiplatelet therapy (e.g., ticagrelor) to assist with blood management during cardiopulmonary bypass.
- **Use of aprotinin and steroids**: Aprotinin is used selectively, and steroids are often administered during circulatory arrest.

### Challenges in Special Populations
- **Pregnant patients**: In pregnancy-related aortic dissections, management depends on the stage of pregnancy. Surgery is typically performed if the dissection is life-threatening, with higher risks of fetal complications.
