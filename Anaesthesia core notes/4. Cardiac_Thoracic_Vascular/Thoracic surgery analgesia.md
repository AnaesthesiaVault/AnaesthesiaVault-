# Thoracic Analgesia

## Thoracic Incisions

### Median Sternotomy and Partial Sternotomy
- Allow access to midline structures.

### Thoracotomy Incisions
- Determined by their relationship to the latissimus dorsi muscle.
  - **Standard Posterolateral Thoracotomy**:
	- Transects the latissimus dorsi muscle.
	- Provides good exposure to the entire hemithorax, including lung, oesophagus, mediastinum, cardiac structures, and the aorta on the left.
  - **Anterolateral Thoracotomy**:
	- Transects the serratus anterior muscle.
	- Used in minimally invasive cardiac and thoracic surgery, trauma front room thoracotomy for rapid access to the aorta, pericardium, and other structures.

## Anatomy and Physiology

### Sensory Afferents
- **Skin incision and intercostal muscles**: Intercostal nerves T4–T6.
- **Chest drains**: Intercostal nerves T7–T8.
- **Mediastinal pleura, lung, and mediastinal structures**: Vagus nerve (CN X).
- **Central diaphragmatic pleura**: Phrenic nerve (C3–C5).
- **Ipsilateral shoulder**: Brachial plexus.
- **Parietal pleura**: Innervated by intercostal and phrenic nerves; pain-sensitive.
- **Visceral pleura**: Sensitive mainly to stretch.
- **Latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior muscles**: Thoracodorsal and long thoracic nerves (C5 to C7 roots of the brachial plexus).

### Reasons for Intense Pain
- Muscle division, rib retraction or resection, and destruction of the intercostal nerves.
- Posterolateral thoracotomy incision spans approximately six dermatomes, from the third dermatome posteriorly to the seventh or eighth dermatome anteriorly.
- Up to three chest drains may be required after thoracotomy, often inserted in the eighth or ninth intercostal space, which falls outside the analgesia provided by the epidural or paravertebral block.
- No single analgesic technique can inhibit all these pain afferents.

## Epidemiology and Importance
- **Persistent Pain**:
  - 25% of patients experience moderate to severe pain at six months post-thoracotomy.
  - Severely affects the quality of life in 40% of these patients.
- **Risk Factors for Chronic Post-Thoracotomy Pain**:
  - Male sex, age > 60 years, preoperative pain, and acute pain postoperatively.
  - Incidence: 30%–60%.
- **Consequences of Poor Analgesia**:
  - Poor ventilatory mechanics, shallow breathing, impaired coughing leading to atelectasis, retention of secretions, hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory failure.
  - Cardiovascular dysfunction due to increased sympathetic tone resulting in increased myocardial oxygen demand, afterload, myocardial dysfunction, and arrhythmias.
  - Increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
  - Longer hospital stays and increased ICU admissions.

## Choice of Analgesic Technique
- Ideal technique includes opioids (patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)), anti-inflammatory agents, and local anesthetics (epidural, intrathecal, paravertebral blocks, intercostal nerve blocks, cryoprobe neurolysis).

### Surgical Strategies
- Non-spreading VATS procedures, muscle-sparing techniques, less rib retraction, and rib preservation.
- Strict layered closure, approximating each individual layer of muscle correctly, and avoiding over-approximation of the ribs.

### Systemic Agents
- **Opioids**: Effective for background pain but not for acute pain with cough or movement.
- **NSAIDs and Paracetamol**:
  - Reduce opioid consumption by more than 30% after thoracotomy.
  - Particularly useful for treating ipsilateral shoulder pain postoperatively.
- **Ketamine**:
  - Low-dose intravenous infusions may be effective for refractory pain or contraindications to more common techniques.
- **Dexmedetomidine**:
  - Maintenance infusion doses for analgesia: 0.3 to 0.4 μg/kg/hr.

### Nerve Blocks

#### Intercostal Nerve Blocks
- Placed near the posterior axillary line to cover the lateral cutaneous branch of the intercostal nerve.
- Total bupivacaine dose should not exceed 1 mg/kg.

#### Interpleural Analgesia
- Unreliable in its analgesic effect.

#### Cryoprobe Neurolysis and TENS
- **Cryoprobe Neurolysis**:
  - Application of a −60 °C probe to the exposed intercostal nerves intraoperatively.
  - Produces an intercostal block lasting up to six months but associated with chronic neuralgia.
- **TENS**:
  - Useful in mild to moderate pain but ineffective for severe pain.

#### Paravertebral Blocks
- Paravertebral space is deep to the endothoracic fascia.
- Provides sensory and sympathetic block of multiple thoracic dermatomes unilaterally or bilaterally.
- Comparable to thoracic epidural infusion for post-thoracotomy pain.
- **Advantages**:
  - Comparable analgesia, fewer failed blocks, decreased risk of neuraxial hematoma, less hypotension, nausea, or urinary retention.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Single-level block may only cover 2 to 4 dermatomes, requiring multiple injections.
  - Cannot be used in patients on antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy.

#### Serratus Anterior Plane (SAP) Block
- Considered the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block of the chest wall.
- Local anesthetic into the facial plane superficial or deep to the serratus anterior muscle.
- Blocks the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves T2 to T9.
- **Advantages**:
  - No autonomic block, risk of pleural puncture, or serious spinal cord injury.
  - Complements thoracic PVB, TEA, or intercostal nerve blocks for chest drain-related pain.
  - Easy to perform.

#### Continuous Erector Spinae Plane (ESP) Block
- Local anesthetic is injected into the tissue plane deep to erector spinae muscle but superficial to the transverse processes.
- Promotes extensive craniocaudal spread of local anesthetic, providing good analgesia.
- Simple to perform using ultrasound, with reduced risk of pleural puncture and epidural spread.
### Erector Spinae Plane Block

**Indications**:

- Analgesia for rib fractures
- Back and chest wall surgeries

**Goal**:  
Injection of local anesthetic in the plane deep to the erector spinae muscles and superficial to the transverse processes, to achieve a craniocaudal distribution along several vertebral levels.

**Equipment**:

- **Transducer**: Linear or curved
- **Needle**: 22 gauge, 5-10 cm short bevel
- **Local Anesthetic Volume**: 20-30 mL

**Essential Fact**:  
At higher thoracic levels, e.g., above T5, the trapezius, rhomboid major, and erector spinae muscles can be identified as three layers superficial to the transverse processes. In the lower and mid-thoracic levels, only the trapezius and erector spinae muscles can be seen.

## Thoracic Epidural Analgesia (TEA)
- Gold standard for post-thoracic and upper abdominal surgery analgesia.
- Failure rate of 15% and poor coverage of chest-tube insertion sites.
- Commonly placed between T3 and T8 with bupivacaine and fentanyl or hydromorphone infusions.
- **Synergy**: Opioids and local anesthetics produce segmental epidural analgesia.
- **Lipid-Soluble Agents**:
  - E.g., fentanyl, sufentanil; narrow dermatomal spread, rapid onset, low incidence of pruritus/nausea.
  - Significant systemic effects when used as epidural infusions.
- **Hydrophilic Opioids**:
  - E.g., morphine, hydromorphone; preferable for extensive incisions covering many dermatomes.
- Paramedian approach at mid-thoracic levels decreases the difficulty of placing thoracic epidurals.
