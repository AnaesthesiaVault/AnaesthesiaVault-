# Mycobacterium Tuberculosis

[Tuberculosis](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Mycobacterium-Tuberculosis/)

## Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

1. **Initial Infection**:
	
	- Airborne droplets containing _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ bacilli enter the airway.
	- Airflow and lung anatomy favor the deposition of bacilli in the midlung zone.
	- Alveolar macrophages engulf inhaled bacilli via phagocytosis.
	- Bacilli evade intracellular destruction via complex mechanisms.
2. **Immune Response**:
	
	- Macrophages infected with bacilli release inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1B, IL-6/8).
	- Pro-inflammatory cytokines further activate and recruit neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, and monocytes to the site of respiratory infection.
3. **Infection Control or Spread**:
	
	- If intracellular lysosomal enzymes are released, the bacilli are digested and destroyed, clearing the infection.
		- **Clinical Finding**: Sputum culture and smear microscopy negative for _M. tuberculosis_.
	- If bacilli evade destruction:
		- Infected macrophages travel to thoracic lymph nodes via the lymphatic system leading to immune cell proliferation within thoracic nodes.
			- **Clinical Finding**: Hilar and paratracheal lymphadenopathy.
4. **Granuloma Formation**:
	
	- Recruited macrophages phagocytose extracellular bacilli and become infected.
	- Macrophages form a granuloma to isolate and contain the bacilli.
	- Recruited dendritic cells phagocytose _M. tuberculosis_ and present antigens to T-cells via MHC class II receptors.
	- CD4+ T-cells are sensitized to _M. tuberculosis_ antigens and release IFN-γ.
	- IFN-γ activates infected macrophages within the granuloma to more effectively destroy intracellular bacilli.
		- **Clinical Finding**: Sputum culture and smear microscopy positive for _M. tuberculosis_.
5. **Latent Infection**:
	
	- Bacilli within granuloma survive lysosomal enzymes and become dormant.
		- **Latent M. tuberculosis**: +/- reactivation due to immune suppression (e.g., TNF-α inhibitors).
		- **Clinical Finding**: Positive tuberculin skin test and positive IFN-γ release assay.
6. **Reactivation and Active Disease**:
	
	- Center of granuloma necroses and liquefies, allowing bacilli to escape back into the airways.
		- Bacilli re-enter the host’s airway, allowing droplet transmission to other hosts.
		- **Clinical Finding**: Ghon focus visible on chest X-ray.
7. **Complications**:
	
	- Active _M. tuberculosis_:
		- Multifactorial response, most with unclear mechanisms.
		- **Clinical Findings**:
			- Fevers
			- Night sweats
			- Weight loss
			- Chronic cough
		- Accumulation of inflammatory mediators and necrotic tissue in the lung, irritating airways.
8. **Dissemination**:
	
	- Bacilli spread to other regions of the body, leading to extrapulmonary tuberculosis.

### Summary of the Effect of Tuberculosis Treatment on Various Anaesthetic Agents

|**Drug Class**|**Effect of Tuberculosis Treatment**|**Recommendation**|
|---|---|---|
|**Induction Agents**|Unchanged|Beware risk of awareness with total intravenous anaesthesia|
|**Volatile Agents**|Increased risk of halothane hepatitis|Newer agents are preferable|
|**Local Anaesthetics**|Unchanged|Useful to avoid general anaesthetics and opioids|
|**Muscle Relaxants**|Increased metabolism of rocuronium and vecuronium|Titrate and monitor response using nerve stimulator|
|**Opiates**|Increased metabolism, often requiring more frequent dosing|Titrate to effect. The use of regional techniques and patient-controlled analgesia is recommended|

### Notes

- **Rifampicin**: Thrombocytopenia, enzyme inducer (more frequent dosing of NMBAs/opioids)
- **In (Isoniazid)**: Sensory neuropathy (prevented with Pyridoxine - vitamin B6)
- **Ethambutol**: Optic neuritis
- **Drug-induced hepatitis**
