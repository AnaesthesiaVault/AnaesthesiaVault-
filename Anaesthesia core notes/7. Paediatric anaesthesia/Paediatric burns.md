# Burns in Children: Key Concepts

## Introduction

In the treatment of burns in children, a **humane, friendly, gentle, and encouraging approach** is essential. Burn injuries not only cause immediate physical harm but also result in long-term suffering and scarring. The burns of today lead to future pain and lifelong scars, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive and compassionate care.

## Survival Factors

### Survival Depends On
- **Age of the patient**–Younger children, particularly neonates, have a higher mortality risk, despite being more likely to survive.
- **Site, depth, and percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) burned**.
- **Presence or absence of inhalational injury**–Inhalational injuries significantly increase mortality.
  
### Factors Impacting Survival
- **Burn shock and resuscitation**–Prompt and adequate fluid resuscitation is critical in preventing burn shock.
- **Inhalational injury**–Presence of airway burns worsens prognosis.
- **Rapidity of wound closure**–Early wound closure is crucial to prevent infection and reduce hypermetabolic response.
- **Burn hypermetabolism**–Burn injuries trigger a hypermetabolic state that requires appropriate nutritional support to manage.

## Types of Burns
1. **Thermal** (most common)
2. **Electrical**
3. **Radiation**
4. **Chemical**

## Inhalational Injury

### Diagnosis of Inhalational Injury
#### History of the Injury
- Suspect inhalational injury if the patient was **trapped in an enclosed space** during the burn incident.

#### Clinical Suspicion
- Burns to the **face, neck, eyes, upper trunk, and nose**.
- **Singed eyebrows, eyelashes, and nose hairs**.
- **Soot in the sputum**.
- **Hoarseness, stridor, respiratory distress**, and use of accessory muscles for breathing.
- **Change in voice** and **brassy cough**.
- **Abnormal chest X-ray** findings, such as patchy opacification or "white-out" appearance.
- Arterial blood gas showing **low PaO2**.
- **Raised carboxyhaemoglobin levels** (indicating carbon monoxide inhalation).

### Salient Features of Inhalational Injury
- **Stridor**, brassy cough, and **dysphonia**.
- **Respiratory distress**.
- In children, inhalational injury may be misdiagnosed as **croup, tracheomalacia,** or **tracheobronchitis**.
- Symptoms can be **delayed up to 48 hours** post-injury.
- **Endotracheal intubation** is required in more than 50% of children with airway burns.
- **Endoscopy** is performed to assess the severity of injury and manage the airway, especially when upper airway laryngoscopy is inadequate to evaluate damage below the vocal cords.
- **Secondary pneumonia** occurs in more than 50% of cases.
- **High-frequency, low-pressure ventilation** is preferred to minimize the risk of barotrauma.
- **Increased fluid requirements** are necessary to maintain haemodynamic stability.
- Inhalational injury **increases mortality by 50%**, independent of the TBSA burned.
- **Aerosolized heparin** may be used to loosen airway casts.
- **Prophylactic antibiotics and steroids** are not recommended.

## Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)

Toxic shock syndrome should be considered in any burned child who appears more ill than would be expected given the extent of their burns. TSS most commonly occurs in children **younger than two years** old and typically within **two days of a burn injury involving less than 10% TBSA**.

# Classification of Burns

- Most burns are a combination of **superficial and deep** layers and are best assessed **after 2–3 days**.
- The type of pain experienced depends on the depth of the burn:
  - **Acute nociceptive inflammatory pain** for superficial burns.
  - **Neuropathic pain** for deeper burns.
  - **No pain** in areas of full-thickness (deep) burns where nerve endings are destroyed.

This structured approach provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts regarding burn injuries in children, focusing on survival, diagnosis, and management strategies.

### Burn Classification

Burn injuries cause significant physiological changes in various systems of the body, classified into **early (first 24–48 hours)** and **late (>48 hours)** stages.

## Airways
- **Upper airway**:
  - **Early**: Obstruction, oedema, and stridor due to thermal damage.
  - **Late**: Scarring of the face, leading to limited facial movement and restricted mouth opening; potential for tracheal stenosis.
  
- **Lower airway**:
  - **Early**: Smoke inhalation leading to wheezing, respiratory distress, and pulmonary oedema.
  - **Late**: Potential scarring and airway damage from prolonged exposure and inflammation.

## Pulmonary System
- **Early**:
  - **Hypoxia**: Due to airway injury or inhalation of toxic gases.
  - **Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning**: Requires prompt diagnosis and treatment.
  
- **Late**:
  - **Circumferential chest wall restriction**: Burns involving the chest can limit respiratory expansion.
  - **Infection**: Pulmonary infections are common and may lead to pneumonia.
  - **Restrictive lung disease**: Progressive fibrosis causes restrictive lung patterns, reducing lung compliance.

## Circulation
- **Early**:
  - **Hypovolaemia**: Fluid loss from burn surfaces results in significant volume depletion.
  - **Decreased cardiac output (CO)**: The initial response to hypovolaemia.
  - **Increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR)**: As part of the body's compensatory mechanisms.
  - **Ischaemia-reperfusion injury**: Due to fluid shifts and tissue damage.
- **Late**:
  - **Increased cardiac output (CO)**: As the hypermetabolic state progresses.
  - **Hypertension** and **tachycardia**: Often associated with the late hyperdynamic circulatory state.

## Neurology
- **Confusion, cerebral oedema**, and **raised intracranial pressure (ICP)** due to metabolic derangements and hypoxia.
- **Burns encephalopathy**: Characterized by confusion, seizures, delirium, hallucinations, and coma. Causes include hypoxia, sepsis, cortical vein thrombosis, and hyponatremia.

## Pharmacological Considerations
- **Suxamethonium contraindicated** after 12 hours post-burn due to risk of hyperkalaemia.
- **Late**:
  - Resistance to **non-depolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMR)** due to upregulation of acetylcholine receptors.
  - **Opioid tolerance**: Results from prolonged opioid use during burn management.

## Endocrine System
- **Early**: Reduction in thyroid hormones **T3** and **T4**.
- **Late**: **Hypermetabolic response** that lasts up to 1 year, characterized by:
  - Increased **basal metabolic rate**.
  - Elevated **temperature** and **catabolism**.

## Electrolytes
- All electrolytes are affected, with a tendency towards **hypo-electrolyte states**. Sodium levels can fluctuate between hypoand hypernatremia depending on fluid management.

## Glucose Metabolism
- **Insulin resistance** and **hyperglycaemia** are common due to stress responses and hypermetabolic state.

## Gastrointestinal System
- **Stasis** of the gut, risk of **ulceration**, and **ischaemia**.
- **Abdominal compartment syndrome** may develop due to increased intra-abdominal pressure.

## Haematological System
- **Hypercoagulable state**: Increased risk of thromboembolism.
- **Thrombocytopenia**: Decreased platelet count may occur due to consumption and sepsis.

## Kidneys
- **Early**:
  - **Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)** due to hypoperfusion and myoglobinuria (especially in extensive muscle damage).
  - **Renal injury** caused by hypoperfusion, inflammatory mediators, and release of proteins into plasma.
  
- **Late**:
  - **Increased GFR** and **tubular dysfunction** in response to fluid resuscitation.
  - Late-stage renal injury often results from **sepsis** or **nephrotoxic medications**.

## Sepsis Consideration
- **Sepsis** is a significant cause of morbidity in burned patients. Suspect **toxic shock syndrome (TSS)** if the clinical presentation does not correlate with the extent of the burn area.
# Peri-operative Management of Burns in Children
## Pre Operative
### Resuscitation (RESUS)

The aim of resuscitation is to balance **over-resuscitation** (which may cause pulmonary oedema) and **under-resuscitation** (leading to hypoperfusion and organ damage). The goal is to maintain **organ perfusion** during the shock state and restore **intravascular volume**. Key endpoints for resuscitation include:

- **Urine output**: 1–2 mL/kg/hour.
- **Mean arterial pressure (MAP)**: > 65 mmHg.
- **Acid-base status**: Monitor via arterial blood gases (ABG) to detect metabolic acidosis.
- **Serum lactate**: Levels > 2 mmol/L may indicate inadequate perfusion.

Advanced hemodynamic monitoring such as **transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE)** and **focused transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** are promising technologies but are not yet routine in clinical practice.

### Nil Per Os (NPO)
- **Clear fluids**: Allowed up to **two hours** before surgery.
- **Nasogastric tube (NGT) feeds**: Follow general NPO guidelines, stopping at least 6 hours before surgery.
- **Nasojejunal tube (NJT) feeds**: Should be individualized, considering the patient’s needs and the timing of surgery.

### Anxiety Management

Anxiety tends to increase with repeated visits to the operating theatre, making **psychological preparation** crucial:

- **EMLA™ cream** (lidocaine and prilocaine) should be considered for pain relief during procedures.
- **Medical play**: Child-friendly explanations of what will happen during surgery can reduce anxiety at induction.
- Consider **midazolam** (0.5 mg/kg orally) for preoperative anxiolysis in extremely anxious children, particularly those older than six months.

### Booking the Case

- **Patient demographics**: Ensure the name, folder number, age, weight, consent, and starting **haemoglobin (Hb)** level are recorded.
- **Surgical factors**: Include the **percentage of TBSA** involved (areas for debridement and donor sites), and the specific site for operation.
- **Order of patients**: The youngest patients should be scheduled **first**, with **septic patients** at the end of the list to minimize the risk of cross-contamination.
- **Blood requirements**: If blood transfusion is anticipated based on the patient's Hb and extent of surgery, ensure cross-matching is done. For operations involving >30% TBSA (debridement and donor sites), ensure an appropriate blood volume is available (typically based on estimated blood volume: 80 mL/kg in children).

**Blood-sparing techniques** may reduce transfusion needs:
- **Clysis** (subcutaneous infiltration of fluid with adrenaline and local anesthetic).
- **Topical adrenaline swabs**.
- **Fast surgical techniques**.
- Use of **electrocautery**.

### Preoperative History

The **AMPLE** mnemonic is used to gather essential preoperative history:

- **A**llergies.
- **M**edications: Current medications, especially those affecting coagulation, analgesia, and any prior anesthesia reactions.
- **P**re-existing illnesses: Chronic illnesses such as asthma, diabetes, or epilepsy.
- **L**ast meal: Time of the last intake of food or fluids.
- **E**vents leading to the burn: Mechanism of injury, inhalation exposure, and any associated trauma.

### Examination
- **Airway**: Assess for contractures around the neck or face that may complicate intubation.
- **Breathing**: Evaluate for respiratory distress, especially in patients with suspected inhalational injury, which increases mortality by 20%. Burns to the chest may cause **chest splinting** from tight dressings or circumferential burns. Pneumonia independently increases mortality by 40%, and when combined with inhalational injury, the risk of death increases by 60%.
- **Circulation**: Assess **capillary refill** and the adequacy of **IV access**.
- **Disability**: Use the **AVPU** scale to assess consciousness: **A**lert, responds to **V**oice, responds to **P**ain, **U**nresponsive.
- **Fluids**: Evaluate fluid balance–what, how much, and by which route the fluids are being administered.
- **Glucose**: Monitor glucose levels to manage stress hyperglycaemia.

### Investigations
- **Recent haemoglobin (Hb)** level: To assess for anaemia and the potential need for transfusion.
- **Platelet count (PTL)** and **coagulation profile**: Check for any coagulopathies that could increase intraoperative bleeding risk.
- **Arterial blood gas (ABG)**: If sepsis is suspected, to assess acid-base balance, oxygenation, and ventilation status.
- **Chest X-ray (CXR)**: Only indicated if respiratory disease or inhalational injury is suspected.

### Premedication

Premedication should address **pain**, **anxiety**, **amnesia**, and **sedation**:

- **Analgesia**:
  - **Paracetamol**: 15 mg/kg orally or rectally.
  - **Morphine**: 0.05–0.1 mg/kg IV for pain relief.
  - **Tilidine hydrochloride (Valoron™)**: 1 mg/kg orally.
  - **Clonidine**: 2–5 mcg/kg orally or IV.
  - **Ketamine**: 0.5 mg/kg orally or intranasally for analgesia and sedation.
  - **Gabapentin**: 10–20 mg/kg orally for neuropathic pain.
  
- **Sedation**:
  - **Trimeprazine (Vallergan™)**: 1–2 mg/kg orally.
  - **Hydroxyzine**: 0.5–1 mg/kg orally.
  - **Promethazine**: 0.5–1 mg/kg orally.
  - **Droperidol**: 0.05–0.1 mg/kg IV.
- **Anxiolysis**:
  - **Midazolam**: 0.5 mg/kg orally (maximum 20 mg).
  - **Lorazepam**: 0.05 mg/kg orally or IV.
  - **Hydroxyzine**: 0.5–1 mg/kg orally.
  - **Diazepam**: 0.1–0.3 mg/kg IV or rectally.
- **Amnesia**:
  - **Benzodiazepines** (e.g., midazolam or lorazepam).
  - **Ketamine**: 1–2 mg/kg IV or 6–10 mg/kg IM.
  - **Droperidol**: 0.05–0.1 mg/kg IV.

## Intraoperative Management

### Theatre Preparation
- **Airway management**: Be prepared with all airway devices (ETT, LMA, etc.).
- **IV access**: Insert large-bore cannulas for fluid and blood administration.
- **Temperature control**: Keep the theatre temperature above **28°C** to prevent hypothermia. Warm IV fluids and use warming blankets.

### Antibiotics

Antibiotics are **not routinely** administered but are used for patients with confirmed **bacteraemia**. For burn debridement:

- **Cefazolin**: 50 mg/kg IV every 8 hours.
- For penicillin-allergic patients:
  - **Clindamycin**: 20 mg/kg IV every 6–8 hours.

### Anaesthesia
- **General anaesthesia**: Can be administered either intravenously or via inhalation. Multimodal analgesia is commonly used.
  
#### Ketamine
- **Induction**:
  - 1–2 mg/kg IV.
  - 6–10 mg/kg IM (administered only after inhalational induction due to pain).
  - IM injections should be given in the **vastus lateralis** muscle, not the deltoid.
  
- **Infusion**:
  - Continuous infusion at 4–12 mg/kg/hour.
  - A simplified protocol is to infuse 12 mg/kg/hour for 20 minutes, then 8 mg/kg/hour, and finally 4 mg/kg/hour.

#### Midazolam
- **Bolus**: 0.1–0.2 mg/kg IV.
- **Infusion**: 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hour. Combine midazolam with ketamine in a single syringe for continuous infusion.

#### Additional Anaesthetic Agents
- **Nitrous oxide** and oxygen via nasal cannula (2–3 L/min) can supplement analgesia, particularly during **ketamine TIVA**.

### Airway Control
- **Nasal cannula with capnography**: Ideal for ketamine infusion without airway instrumentation.
- **Laryngeal mask airway (LMA)**: Useful for burns to the lower body. Perform laryngoscopy to clear secretions before placement.
- **Endotracheal tube (ETT)**: For secure airway control, especially for facial or neck burns.

### Blood Loss Management
- **Adrenaline**: Topical application (30 mg in 1L normal saline) to control bleeding.
- **Clysis**: Local infiltration with **bupivacaine** (100 mg in 1L Ringer's lactate) and adrenaline (2 mg).
- **Bipolar diathermy**: Helps minimize bleeding during surgery.

### Fluid Management

For large surgeries:

- Preload with **10–20 mL/kg** of **crystalloid** (Ringer’s lactate or Plasmalyte® B).
- Ensure cross-matched blood is available. Monitor blood loss and haemoglobin levels intraoperatively.

### Monitoring
- **Temperature control**: Ensure normothermia using warm fluids, blankets, overhead heaters, and warm air devices.
- **ECG**: Use surgical staples or crocodile clips for better adhesion.
- **Oximetry**: Place the pulse oximeter on the same limb as the IV, and cover with a waterproof bag.
- **Invasive monitoring**: Secure central lines and communicate with the surgical team about their placement.

### Indications for GA and Dressing Changes
- Large burns (>20% TBSA).
- Burns to sensitive areas (face, hands, feet, perineum).
- Patients with cognitive impairments or PTSD.
- Extensive scar manipulation or dressing removal that causes significant pain.

## Postoperative Management
- **Handover**: Clear communication between theatre and ward staff is essential.
- **Pain control**: Effective analgesia is crucial postoperatively.
- **Fluid balance**: Ongoing losses from operative sites require careful monitoring.
- **Temperature**: Actively warm the child postoperatively to prevent hypothermia.
- **Feeding**: Reintroduce feeding and fluids early. Manage nausea and vomiting aggressively.

# Pain Management in Paediatric Burn Patients

Burn injuries involve complex pain mechanisms, including **nerve damage** and **inflammatory pain**, which fluctuate during the healing process. Adequate pain management in the initial stages of burn injury can help prevent the development of **chronic pain** and significantly improve the quality of life for burn survivors.

## Types of Pain in Burn Survivors

1. **Acute pain**: Immediate pain from the burn injury itself, exacerbated by medical procedures such as dressing changes and debridement.
2. **Chronic pain**: Long-term pain that persists even after the wound has healed, often involving elements of **neuropathic pain**.
3. **Neuropathic pain**: Resulting from nerve damage, presenting as burning, tingling, or shooting pain.

## Challenges in Pain Management

1. **Inadequate emotional support** and reintegration back into society, which can contribute to the persistence of pain.
2. **Misconceptions** about drug side effects and **fear of addiction**, leading to underutilization of appropriate pain management therapies.
3. A lack of understanding that effective pain control is not only ethical but is **scientifically backed**, contributing to better patient outcomes and recovery.
4. **Resource limitations** and poor concern from caregivers, leading to inadequate pain management.
5. **Itching** (pruritus) is a significant component of the pain experience and often overlooked in management.

## Management Strategies

### Nonpharmacological Strategies

- **Distraction techniques**: Child-friendly interventions such as **play therapy**, **music therapy**, and **art therapy** can help distract children from pain and improve their psychological well-being.
- **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and counseling can help reduce anxiety and fear associated with pain.
- **Child life therapists**: These professionals provide age-appropriate explanations and emotional support to children during painful procedures.

### Pharmacotherapy

#### 1. Simple Analgesics

- **Paracetamol**: A foundational analgesic for managing mild to moderate pain in paediatric burns.
	- Dose: **15 mg/kg/dose** every 4–6 hours (maximum 75 mg/kg/day).
- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Effective for controlling inflammation and reducing mild to moderate pain.
	- **Ibuprofen**: 5–10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours (maximum 40 mg/kg/day).
	- NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment or those at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

#### 2. Opioids

- **Morphine**: Mainstay for moderate to severe burn pain, especially in acute settings.
	- Dose: **0.05–0.1 mg/kg IV** every 2–4 hours or **0.2–0.5 mg/kg orally** every 4–6 hours.
- **Fentanyl**: Potent opioid for severe pain, often used in procedural sedation.
	- Dose: **1–2 mcg/kg IV** every 30–60 minutes.
- **Sufentanil**: Ultra-potent opioid, used in severe cases or intraoperatively.
	- Dose: **0.2–0.6 mcg/kg IV**.
- **Tilidine hydrochloride (Valoron™)**: Another option for moderate to severe pain.
	- Dose: **1 mg/kg orally**.
- **Codeine**: Weak opioid used for mild to moderate pain but limited due to variability in metabolism.
	- Dose: **0.5–1 mg/kg orally** every 4–6 hours.

#### 3. Adjuncts

- **Clonidine**: Alpha-2 agonist with analgesic and sedative properties, often used as an adjunct to opioids.
	- Dose: **2–5 mcg/kg orally or IV** every 8–12 hours.
- **Gabapentin**: Particularly useful for **neuropathic pain** and pruritus.
	- Dose: **10–20 mg/kg/day** divided into two or three doses.
	- Gabapentin is effective in reducing chronic pain and itching in paediatric burn patients.
- **Antidepressants**: Especially **tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)** like **amitriptyline** for chronic or neuropathic pain management.
	- Amitriptyline: **0.1–0.5 mg/kg/day**, given at night.

#### 4. Anaesthetics

- **Ketamine**: Used for procedural sedation and pain relief.
	- **Induction**: **1–2 mg/kg IV** or **6–10 mg/kg IM**.
	- **Infusion**: **4–12 mg/kg/hour**.
- **Entonox™** (Nitrous oxide and oxygen): Inhaled analgesic for quick pain relief during minor procedures.
- **Local anaesthetics**: Such as **lidocaine** or **bupivacaine** can be used for regional or local anaesthesia in donor or debridement sites.

### Chronic Pain Management

Chronic pain in burn patients often includes elements of **neuropathic pain**, **anxiety**, and **fear**. It is critical to address these components early and aggressively.

- **Neuropathic pain**: Gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) are first-line agents.
- **Anxiety and fear**: Psychological support, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), is vital to reduce the emotional burden of chronic pain.
- **Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**: Common in burn survivors, requiring a multidisciplinary approach with mental health professionals.

To prevent **withdrawal symptoms**, analgesic and anxiolytic medications used during burn care should be **weaned gradually**, rather than abruptly discontinued. This strategy is particularly important for patients who have received long-term opioid therapy.
