# Anaesthetic Management of Sickle Cell Disease in Children

## Introduction
- Multisystem disease.
- Congenital haemoglobinopathy.
	- Inheritance: autosomal dominant.
- Approximately 4 million people worldwide have sickle cell disease.
- Surgery and anaesthesia carry a high risk for these patients.
## Pathophysiology
- Adult red blood cells normally contain three different types of haemoglobin:
	- Haemoglobin A (HbA): 96-98% of total haemoglobin.
	- Haemoglobin A2 (HbA2): 1.5-3% of the total.
	- Foetal haemoglobin (HbF): 0.5-0.08% of the total.
- Haemoglobin S (HbS) occurs as a result of a single DNA base change (adenine to thymidine).
	- Results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the β-globin chain.
- Inherited in an autosomal co-dominant way:
	- Homozygous expression of the abnormal gene (HbSS) produces sickle cell disease.
- Patients with sickle cell disease:
	- Have no normal adult haemoglobin (HbA) and only have HbS, HbA2, and HbF.
	- Approximately 95% of their haemoglobin is HbS.
- Patients with heterozygous HbS (sickle cell trait):
	- Are carriers but asymptomatic and have a normal life expectancy.
- Sickle haemoglobin (HbS) polymerises into insoluble microfibrils in the deoxygenated state.
	- These parallel microfibrils cause red cell membrane damage, resulting in the classical sickle cell deformity.
	- Deformed red cells are more rigid and less capable of passing through the microcirculation, causing increased blood viscosity and impaired blood flow.
	- These cells have a shortened survival time (5-15 days in homozygous sickle cell disease), resulting in the haemolytic anaemia characteristic of sickle cell disease.

![[41B8AF15-EC13-4D21-ACDF-76918A574A06.jpeg]]

- There is increasing evidence that the primary event in sickle disease is oxidative damage to the arterial endothelium (the lining of the vessel wall) due to the effects of sickle haemoglobin breakdown.
	- HbS is extremely unstable and this may be the cause of vascular damage rather than its insolubility.
	- Biochemical markers of endothelial damage are present in sickle cell disease and suggest that perhaps the disease should be considered a chronic inflammatory disorder.
- The spectrum of sickling disorders is widened by the combination of HbS with other haemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia and haemoglobin C and haemoglobin D.
	- Polymerisation of HbS is affected by the presence of other haemoglobins, but in varying degrees.
	- Patients with HbSD are severely affected, while patients with HbSC are less affected by sickling and suffer more thrombotic complications.
	- The combination of α and β thalassaemia with HbS results in disease ranging in severity depending on the nature of the thalassaemia mutation.
## Epidemiology
- Approximately 4 million people with sickle cell disease worldwide.
	- Most common in West African and Caribbean populations.
- In Equatorial Africa, the sickle cell trait occurs in up to 30% of the population.
- The high prevalence is a result of balanced polymorphism driven by the relative resistance of heterozygotes to malaria.
- In North America, approximately 8% of the black population have sickle-cell trait, and up to 1.3% have sickle cell disease (SCD).
- The majority of sickle cell disease in the UK is found in African-Caribbean populations in large cities where up to 10% of individuals carry the gene.
- The HbS gene also occurs in some areas in Mediterranean regions such as Greece, Southern Italy, Turkey, and in Saudi Arabia and Central India.
## Diagnosis
- The gold standard for diagnosis of sickle cell disease is haemoglobin electrophoresis.
	- The simpler Sickledex test confirms the presence of HbS; however, electrophoresis is required to distinguish the phenotype.
	- The Sickledex test uses sodium metabisulphite as a reducing agent that causes HbS to precipitate in a hyperosmolar phosphate buffer solution to produce a cloudy suspension.
- The Sickledex test is not reliable in the neonatal period as there are low levels of HbS and high levels of HbF that have normal solubility, and may result in a false negative result.
	- It becomes reliable after 6 months of age when the HbF levels have dropped.
- Haemoglobin electrophoresis is the only method of distinguishing phenotype.
	- These tests separate molecules on the basis of their charge at a given pH.
	- Electrophoresis of umbilical cord blood can be used for diagnosis in the newborn.
- Antenatal diagnosis of sickle cell disease is possible by analysis of the DNA of foetal tissue from chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis.

## Clinical Manifestations of Sickle Cell Disease in Children
- Multisystem disorder
### Anaemia
- This is universal in patients with HbSS.
- Usually have a haemoglobin level of 6-9g/dl.
- The anaemia is usually well tolerated and adequate tissue oxygenation is maintained due to:
	- compensatory increase in cardiac output
	- effective release of oxygen to the tissues due to the low affinity of HbS for oxygen.
- A systolic flow murmur is a frequent finding and congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly can occur in adults.
- Children with sickle disease should receive iron and folic acid supplementation.
### Painful Crises
- Associated with the sudden onset of severe pain, most commonly arising in bone and joints due to ischaemia and infarction in the marrow or cortical bone.
- Dactylitis (painful swelling of small bones of hands and feet) occurs in up to half of children by the age of two years
	- sign of severe disease.
- Abdominal pain occurs in older children and can be caused by:
	- bowel dysfunction
	- organ infarction
	- referred pain from the ribs.
- These abdominal crises can present as an ‘acute abdomen’ and can be difficult to distinguish from acute surgical disorders which cause abdominal pain.
- 1% of patients have more than six episodes of pain per year.
- Precipitants for acute painful crises include:
	- infection
	- dehydration
	- cold
	- hypoxia
	- stress.
- Up to 57% of episodes have no identifiable precipitant.
### Acute Chest Syndrome
- Defined as:
	- Fever more than 38.5°C
	- Respiratory distress or chest pain
	- Appearance of new lobar infiltration on chest X-ray.
- Hypoxia is common and ventilatory support is occasionally needed in severe sickle chest crisis.
- The majority of patients are managed with:
	- oxygen therapy
	- hydration
	- blood transfusion
- The incidence of acute chest syndrome in the postoperative child may be as high as 10% in those with severe disease undergoing major surgery.
- Risk factors for sickle chest crisis are:
	- age between 2-4 years
	- persistently raised white cell count
- These risk factors should be assessed preoperatively.
- Multiple episodes of acute chest syndrome in children are likely to result in pulmonary fibrosis and chronic lung disease as the child gets older.
### Cerebrovascular Accidents (CVA)
- The majority of CVAs in patients with sickle cell disease occur during childhood.
- 5% of children with sickle cell disease have overt CVAs due to ischaemia or infarction.
- These are typically caused by vascular lesions in the cerebral vessels and may occur as watershed infarctions during a sickle crisis.
- Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can identify children at risk of cerebral infarction and it is has been shown that treating patients at risk with regular transfusion programmes significantly reduces the incidence of stroke.
- Children are also at risk of intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhages.
### Aplastic Crisis
- Usually precipitated by infection
	- parvovirus is an important pathogen.
- There is suppression of erythropoesis in the bone marrow and a dramatic fall in haemoglobin levels.
- Early diagnosis and treatment with blood transfusion is essential.
### Acute Splenic Sequestration
- Rare complication
	- commonest in children under five years of age.
- Large numbers of red cells are sequestered in the spleen and the haemoglobin level drops precipitously.
- This may present with acute collapse and shock, and may require resuscitation and blood transfusion.
- Children who suffer repeat episodes of splenic sequestration may require splenectomy.
- More commonly, splenic infarction occurs as a result of repeated sickling episodes
	- results in functional hyposplenism.
- Patients are at increased risk of infections, particularly with encapsulated bacteria such as:
	- Streptococcus pneumoniae
	- Neisseria meningitides
	- Haemophilus influenza B.
- All children with homozygous sickle disease should receive prophylactic penicillin V from birth.
### Osteomyelitis
- SCD patients are at higher risk for osteomyelitis than the rest of the population.
- The commonest pathogens are:
	- salmonella
	- staphylococci
### Priapism
- Attacks start as young as eight years.
- Reported by up to 30% of male sufferers of sickle cell disease.
- It can occur in the postoperative period and treatment includes:
	- Hydration
	- Exchange transfusion
	- Intercavernous injections of an α-adrenergic agent.
### Avascular Necrosis
- Intravascular sickling of the red blood cells in the microcirculation of the bone results in:
	- intramedullary sludging
	- stasis
	- thrombosis
	- progressive ischaemia, most often of the femoral head.
- These patients present with pain in the affected joint.
- Orthopaedic management may be conservative or require surgery.
### Long-term Complications of SCD in Adults
- Recurrent sickle cell crises may result in:
	- Gall stones
	- sickle retinopathy
	- leg ulcers
	- chronic renal failure due to renal parenchymal scarring
	- pulmonary hypertension
	- chronic lung disease
	- neurological impairment
	- chronic bone damage
## Anaesthetic Management of Children with Sickle Cell Disease
### Preoperative Screening
#### Pre-operative Screening
- All children in a high-risk population or those with a positive family history should be screened for sickle cell disease.
#### Pre-operative Assessment and Preparation
- Patients at higher risk of perioperative complications:
	- history of chest crisis
	- stroke
	- frequent painful crises
	- severe obstructive sleep apnoea
- All patients with sickle cell disease require meticulous perioperative care.
#### Pre-operative Assessment Should Involve a Careful Review of All Systems
- Multiple episodes of acute chest syndrome may result in:
	- reduced lung volumes
	- pulmonary infarction
	- pulmonary hypertension with low oxygen saturation.
- It is important to check the baseline oxygen saturation before surgery.
- Although more commonly seen in adults, cardiomegaly may be seen on chest X-ray, and echocardiography may be indicated to assess cardiac function.
- Careful neurological examination is essential and any pre-existing neurological deficit from previous CVA should be documented.
- Renal and hepatic function should also be assessed for signs of end-organ damage.
	- even children with HbAS have a renal concentrating defect and they do not tolerate dehydration.
- Surgery for children with sickle disease should be planned carefully and their management should be discussed with the anaesthetic and surgical teams, and if possible, with the paediatricians and haematology teams
- If there is any evidence of active infection, elective surgery should be postponed.
- Where possible, children with SCD should be scheduled first on the theatre list to avoid prolonged starvation and dehydration.
- Patients should be encouraged to drink free clear fluids until two hours before surgery.
#### Blood Transfusion and SCD
- Preoperative blood transfusion is a controversial area:
	- anaesthesia care standards have improved for patients with sickle cell disease
	- the pathophysiology of the disease is better understood
	- many of the precipitating factors for sickle crisis in the perioperative period can be avoided.
- The NHS Blood and Transplant service in the UK is undertaking an international study at present to assess the benefits of preoperative transfusion versus no transfusion in patients undergoing minor and moderate risk surgery (the TAPS study).
	- Theoretically, reducing the percentage of HbSS by prophylactic transfusion should prevent complications of sickle cell disease.
	- Aggressive transfusion regimens are associated with a high incidence of transfusion-associated complications.
- Blood transfusion carries the risk of:
	- allergic reactions
	- acute haemolytic reactions
	- transmission of infection.
- Repeated blood transfusions can cause alloimmunization (the production of antibodies to red cell antigens).
	- These antibodies can cause severe haemolytic reactions.
	- In resource poor areas where screening for infection and highly specific blood cross matching is limited, the balance of the risks versus the benefits of blood transfusion needs to be carefully considered.
- Management plans for transfusion therefore need to be individualised for each patient, taking into account:
	- patient’s medical history
	- type of surgery
	- should be done in consultation with the anaesthetist, surgeon, paediatrician and haematologist, as well as the patient’s family
- Guidelines may vary between hospitals and between regions.
- Transfusion may be used to increase the haemoglobin level
	- repeated top-up transfusion will also reduce the %S level in blood.
- Current transfusion guidelines at Great Ormond Street Children’s hospital in London:
	- Children with no special risk factors having short procedures such as insertion of grommets or minor dental work–no transfusion, provided the haemoglobin is at the normal baseline level (Hb >6g/dl)
	- Children with no special risk factors having intermediate risk surgery such as tonsillectomy or laparotomy - top-up transfusion to Hb 9-11g/dl.
	- Children who have had a chest crisis, CVA or suffer frequent painful crises, or children undergoing major surgery such as thoracic or neurosurgery–sequential top-ups or exchange transfusion to achieve Hb 9-11g/dl AND HbS level <30%.
- It is essential to avoid increased tissue viscosity, so in all circumstances the Hb should not exceed 12g/dL.
- Emergency surgery–patients should be treated the same, but if time does not allow, blood should be crossmatched and ready for surgery.
		- All cases should be discussed with a haematologist if possible.
### Intraoperative Management
#### Oxygenation
- Primary goal is to maintain good oxygenation during the perioperative period.
- Perioperative pulse oximetry monitoring is essential.
- Patients may have impaired oxygen delivery resulting from chronic anaemia or chronic lung damage, and may have a limited reserve during hypoxic episodes.
- Even short periods of hypoxia must be avoided.
- Postoperative CPAP or a nasopharyngeal airway may be indicated in those with obstructive sleep apnoea.
#### Dehydration
- Dehydration  is  poorly tolerated. 
	- Leads  to :
		- increased  tissue viscosity
		- poor  perfusion
		- acidosis 
		- increased  sickling.
- Little evidence to support  fluid loading or  aggressive  hydration,  however  adequate  hydration  must  be  maintained  pre,  intra‐  and  postoperatively .
- The  patient  should be encouraged  to  drink clear fluids up until 2 hours before surgery, or if this is  not  possible,  to  have  intravenous  fluids  during  the  preoperative  fasting  period.  
- Intravenous  fluids  should  be used during surgery
	- Ringers lactate or Hartmann’s
- Postoperative  intravenous  fluids should be prescribed  until oral intake  is re‐established .
#### Acidosis
- Avoid acidosis.
	- causes increased sickling which in turn increases blood viscosity and impairs tissue perfusion.
- This will cause the tissues to become more acidotic, cause further sickling and could result in a sickle crisis.
#### Temperature Management
- Avoid hypothermia.
- Hypothermia causes:
	- vasoconstriction
	- hypoperfusion
	- increased blood viscosity
	- decreased venous oxygen tension
- All lead to increased sickling.
#### Vascular Stasis
- Avoid vascular stasis by:
	- maintaining a good circulating volume
	- careful positioning
	- use of pneumatic compression devices if possible in prolonged surgery
#### Tourniquets
- The safety of the use of tourniquets in patients with sickle cell disease has not been established and should be considered on an individual basis weighing up the risks and benefits.
- Tourniquets after exsanguination of the limb may be used safely in patients with sickle cell trait.
#### Cell Savers
- The high incidence of sickling in cell savers prevents their use in sickle cell disease.
### Postoperative Management
#### Oxygen Therapy
- Oxygen saturation should be monitored continuously
	- supplemental oxygen should be given to maintain saturations >92%.
#### Fluid Management
- Continue intravenous maintenance fluids until the child is tolerating oral fluids.
#### Postoperative Analgesia
- Management of post-operative pain is challenging.
- Patients may have very high perioperative analgesic requirements, and may have tolerance to opioids.
- A multimodal approach should be used with a combination of:
	- opioids where indicated
	- paracetamol
	- NSAIDs
	- regional anaesthesia when possible.
#### Physiotherapy
- Physiotherapy and early ambulation are important to avoid vascular stasis.
#### Nasopharyngeal Airway
- Obstructive sleep apnoea secondary to adenotonsillar hypertrophy is common in children with SCD.
- Careful attention should be paid to these patients postoperatively to avoid:
	- airway obstruction
	- hypoventilation
	- hypoxia.
- A nasopharyngeal airway may be used after tonsillectomy or in those with severe OSA to prevent post-operative airway obstruction and hypoxia.
- In young children, a tracheal tube (the same size as used for surgery) can be cut to length to form a nasopharyngeal airway.
- The nasopharyngeal airway should not be too long–the tube should be carefully inserted through the nose so that the tip just protrudes from behind the soft palate
	- approximately equivalent to the distance from the tip of the nose to the tragus of the ear.
### Postoperative Complications
- Serious post-operative complications usually occur within 48hrs of surgery. They include:
	- Painful crisis
	- Cerebrovascular accident
	- Acute chest syndrome
- Patients need to be monitored carefully for early signs of complications.
#### Management of Sickle Complications
- The anaesthetic team may be involved in managing the acute complications of sickle cell disease:
	- post-operatively
	- when the patient presents to the hospital with an acute crisis
- The management of all sickle crises:
	- establish intravenous fluids
	- oxygen therapy
	- analgesia
	- antibiotics
- Analgesia may require high doses of opiates, as well as the use of regular paracetamol and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or diclofenac.
- Transfusion to an Hb>10g/dl is important, but over transfusion (>12g/dl) must be avoided.
- Exchange transfusion to reduce HbS <20-30% may be indicated in certain situations such as acute chest syndrome or CVA.
	- As a guide, transfusion of 4ml/kg of packed cells raises the haemoglobin concentration by 1g/dl; 8ml/kg of whole blood raises the haemoglobin by 1g/dl.
- Ventilatory support (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or intubation and ventilation) may be required for acute chest syndrome.
- Patients should be carefully monitored for signs of respiratory decompensation.
- Acute sequestration crisis is an important cause of death in children with sickle cell disease.
- Acute hypovolaemia can occur due to pooling of blood in the spleen.
	- Treatment is transfusion of blood and intravenous 0.9% saline for volume replacement.
# Inherited Disorders of Coagulation

## Introduction
- Inherited bleeding (haemostatic) and clotting (thrombotic) disorders are rare but sometimes encountered by anaesthetists during emergency or elective surgeries.
- The perioperative management of these uncommon conditions can be challenging.
## Pathophysiology and Diagnosis
### Inherited Bleeding Disorders
- Haemophilia and von Willebrand’s disease (VWD) are the most common.

![[278D51BC-7BEA-4A42-A260-4AF209484434_4_5005_c.jpeg]]

### Haemophilia
- Haemophilia can be classified as haemophilia A, B, or C depending on the deficiency of the coagulation factors VIII, IX, or XI respectively.
- Haemophilia A and B: inherited as X-linked recessive (XLR)
	- Mutation in the long arm of chromosome X at F8 and F9 genes, respectively.
	- Males are affected and females are carriers.
	- One-third of the patients presenting with haemophilia have no family history.
- Factors VIII and IX mainly play an important role in the intrinsic pathway of the clotting cascade.
	- Required for thrombin generation and fibrin formation.
- Plasma concentration of factors VIII and IX can be expressed in IU/ml or as percentages of normal pooled plasma.
	- 1 IU is the concentration of coagulation factor in 1 ml of normal pooled plasma.
	- Normal value is 0.5–1.5 IU ml2 1 or 50–150%.
- Diagnosis of haemophilia usually suspected when bleeding symptoms occur spontaneously or after trauma.
- The risk of bleeding increases as the factor levels decrease.

![[CD6858CA-1344-4E44-9119-CD3E83BF0942_4_5005_c.jpeg]]

- Patients usually present with:
	- bleeding into the weight-bearing joints (knees, ankles and elbows)
	- bleedinng into muscles and rarely the genitourinary system.
- Most common cause of death is intracranial bleed.
- The routine clotting screen may be normal and the only abnormality may be a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time.
- The definitive diagnosis is made only by a factor level assay.
### Von Willebrand’s Disease
- Most common of inherited bleeding disorders.
- Prevalence of VWD is one in 100
	- Asymptomatic in the majority of patients
	- Clinically significant in only one in 10 000 patients.
- Caused by quantitative or qualitative defect in von Willebrand’s factor (VWF).
- VWF:
	- Plasma glycoprotein
	- Plays a vital role in:
		- Platelet adhesion
		- Platelet aggregation
		- Acts as a carrier for factor VIII and thereby decreasing its clearance from plasma
	- Synthesized in bone megakaryocytes and vascular endothelium
	- Stored in Weibel–Palade bodies in the endothelial cells
- Deficiency of VWF leads to easy bruising from trivial trauma; in particular, bleeding from mucosal surfaces, that is, epistaxis, gums, and bowel.
- Depending upon the type of VWD, patients can have prolonged bleeding after surgery.
- People with blood group O tend to have low VWF levels.
- Classified by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) based on quantitative or qualitative defect of VWF into three types.
	- Type 1 VWD: quantitative defect
	- Type 2 VWD: qualitative defect.
		- Type 2 is further subclassified into four types (type 2A, 2B, 2M, 2N) depending upon:
			- Associated platelet binding and function
			- Factor VIII binding capacity
			- Number of high molecular weight VWF multimers.
		- Type 3 VWD: complete absence of VWF.
	- Type 1 VWD is a mild–moderate bleeding disorder, whereas type 3 VWD is a severe bleeding disorder.
- Autosomal inheritance (dominant or recessive) depending on the subtype.
- Often the only abnormality is a prolonged bleeding time as normal screening tests do not rule out VWD.
- In general, lab diagnosis of VWD is made with quantitative factor VIII, VWF, collagen binding assays, ristocetin cofactor activity, and multimeric analysis.
- The qualitative assays include tests such as glycoprotein binding assay, ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo), and ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination.

## Anaesthetic Considerations
### Anaesthetic Considerations for Haemophilia and VWD
#### Preoperative Assessment
- Detailed history of haemophilia/VWD type and severity.
- Information on response to DDAVP, use of recombinant factors VIII/IX, and previous blood transfusions.
- Complete blood count, coagulation profile, fibrinogen level, and specific factor assays if indicated.
- Evaluate for transfusion-related infections (HIV, Hepatitis B/C).
- Assess for joint deformities, contractures, and airway.
- Multidisciplinary team assessment (haematologist, surgeon, anaesthetist).
#### General Principles
- Multidisciplinary management including haematologist, surgeon, anaesthetist, physiotherapist, and occupational therapist.
- Ensure availability of appropriate factor concentrates.
- Schedule elective surgery early in the week and morning.
- Preoperative clotting screen and specific factor assays.
- Avoid mucosal trauma, i.m. injections; maintain normothermia.
- Care with vascular access and invasive monitoring, consider ultrasound.
- Avoid tachycardia and hypertension.
- Assess risk-benefits for neuraxial and regional blocks; generally avoided.
- Early mobilization, consider mechanical DVT prophylaxis.
- Multimodal pain management, avoid NSAIDs.
### Specific Management
#### Haemophilia
- **Historical Context:**
	- Prior to viral inactivation, common cause of death was transfusion-transmitted infections (Hepatitis C, HIV).
	- Shift from pooled plasma products to recombinant factors.
- **Preoperative Management:**
	- Achieve 80-100% correction of factor VIII before major surgery.
	- Confirm correction levels pre-surgery.
	- Maintain postoperative levels:
		- Up to 6 weeks after orthopaedic procedures.
		- 1-2 weeks after other procedures.
#### Factors and Blood Products
- Recombinant factors VIII and IX: haemophilia A and B.
	- Commercial preparations of factors VIII and IX as lyophilized powder are available.
	- Free from the risk of disease transmission
	- Limiting factor is cost.
	- Dosage:
		- Each FVIII unit per kilogram of body weight infused i.v. will raise the plasma FVIII level by 2% (t1/2 factor VIII= 8–12 h).
		- No of units of FVIII required= weight of patient% factor level desired x0.5.
		- Each FIX unit per kilogram of body weight infused IV will raise the plasma FIX level 1% (t1/2 factor IX= 18–24 h).
		- No of units of FIX required= weight of patientx % factor level desired.
	- Patients must be screened for the presence of inhibitors to factor VIII or IX.
	- Depending upon the amount of inhibitors present, patients are classified as:
		- low risk (inhibitor level <5 Bethesda units/ml)
			- requires higher dose of the deficient factor,
		- high risk (>5 Bethesda units/ml).
			- requires approved alternative regimens like recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) or Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA)
- Intermediate and high purity factor VIII concentrates:
	- plasma derived
	- can have other non-factor VIII proteins
	- alternative when recombinant factors are not available
- Cryoprecipitate:
	- Source of factor VIII, VWF, factor XIII, and fibrinogen.
	- Carries a risk of transmission of blood-borne infections
		- must be used only when recombinant factors are not available.
	- Methylene blue-treated non-UK sourced cryoprecipitate is used for children <16 yr old.
- Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC):
	- Combination of blood clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, protein C and S.
	- Current main indication of PCC is for emergency reversal of warfarin
		- initially developed for treatment of haemophilia B
		- Its thrombogenic calculated units are based on factor IX levels.
	- The dosage is 15–50 units/kg (maximum 5000 units stat).
	- Most PCC contain heparin to prevent activation of the factors.
	- The plasma-derived activated PCCs (FEIBA) are licensed for use in patients with inhibitors to factor VIII and IX.
		- Commercially available products include Beriplexw and Octaplexw and differ in:
			- concentrations of the factors
			- manufacturing process
			- methods for viral inactivation
			- dosage
- Recombinant factor VIIa:
	- Can bind to the surface of activated platelets, thereby directly activating factor X
		- improved generation of thrombin.
	- rFVIIa effective in achieving haemostasis in haemophilia patients with inhibitors in about 80% of cases.
	- The thrombogenic activity of rFVIIa is optimized when fibrinogen levels and pH are within the normal range.
	- Licensed for use in platelet dysfunctional disorders (Glanzman’s thromboasthenia) and Fresh-frozen plasma is no longer used in perioperative management of haemophilia as it carries the risk of blood-borne infections and volume overload.
#### Pharmacological Options
- Desmopressin (1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) or DDAVP:
	- Analogue of vasopressin hormone
	- Acts by releasing VWF which in turn forms a complex with factor
		- prevents its breakdown.
	- Mainly used in treatment of mild form of haemophilia A and VWD.
	- DDAVP produces a twoto five-fold increase in factor VIII levels
		- may be sufficient in mild haemophilia for minor surgery.
		- Ineffective in severe haemophilia A or in haemophilia B.
	- Available as intranasal spray, oral or sublingual tablet, or IV preparation.
	- Peak effect of IV dose is at 60 min and s.c./intranasal is 90–120 min.
	- IV/SC dose is 0.3 mg/kg.
	- Adult nasal spray dosage of 300 mg is equivalent to the standard i.v. dose of 0.2 mg/kg.
	- A dose of 300 mg for those over 50 kg and 150 mg for those up to 50 kg is suggested.
	- Not approved for use in:
		- Children <2 yr
		- Pregnant women.
- Tranexamic acid:
	- Synthetic derivative of amino acid lysine.
	- Antifibrinolytic action due to competitive inhibition of conversion of plasminogen to plasmin which degrades fibrin.
	- The plasma half-life is 2 h.
	- Optimal dosage is unknown and has been successfully used in a wide dose range.
	- It can be used orally (15–25 mg/kg 8 hourly) or IV (10 mg/kg 8 hourly).
	- Conventional oral dosage is 3 g in three divided doses.
	- Should be avoided in patients with haematuria due to obstructive uropathy.
	- Helpful in haemophilia and VWD.
#### Von Willebrand's Disease
- **Majority of Cases:**
	- Do not require blood components.
	- Pharmacological management is sufficient.
- **High-Risk Subtypes:**
	- Maintain VWF level at ~100 IU/dL perioperatively.
	- Maintain >50 IU/dL in the immediate postoperative period.
	- FVIII plasma concentration:
		- Above 100 IU/dL for major surgery.
		- Above 50 IU/dL in the postoperative period.
	- Treatment duration:
		- Major surgery: 7-14 days.
		- Minor surgery: 1-5 days.
- ##### Treatment:
- DDAVP:
	- Approved for use in VWD Type 1.
	- No use in VWD Type 3.
	- Use in VWD Type 2 must be discussed with a haematologist:
		- Variable effect according to sub-types.
		- Can cause thrombocytopenia.
	- Administer at least 90 minutes before operation.
	- Further doses may not be beneficial due to rapid tachyphylaxis.
	- Possible side effects:
		- Hypotension
		- Facial flushing
		- Hyponatraemia
	- Consider fluid restriction during use.
- Antifibrinoltics:
	- Tranexamic acid in the mentioned doses may be useful.
- VWF/factor VIII concentrates:
	- Indicated in:
		- severe cases
		- type 3 VWD
		- qualitative defects of VWF
	- Derived from pooled plasma and are subjected to viral inactivation methods.
	- Various preparations with different ratios of VWF/factor VIII:C and VWF:RCo levels are available (Humate Pw and Alphanate SD/HTw).
	- Products like recombinant factor VIII which contain no VWF are not used in VWD.
	- Venous thromboembolism (VTE) can occur with replacement therapy.
	- Allo-antibody formation occurs in 10–15% of type III VWD.
		- In patients with inhibitors, there is very limited experience reported in the literature but recombinant VIIa (rVIIa) and continuous infusion of high doses of rFVIII have been successfully used.
- Platelet infusions:
	- should be considered if bleeding persists, despite DDAVP and replacement VWF concentrates.
- Cryoprecipitate:
	- Unpredictable effect.
	- Risk of transmissible infections.
	- Should not be used for management of VWD unless other treatment modalities have failed.
## Special Populations and Situations
### Regional Anaesthesia
- No clear-cut guidelines in patients with coagulation disorders.
- Case series and reports of central neuraxial blocks with catheters in haemophiliac patients undergoing lower limb orthopaedic surgeries after correction of factor levels
	- no randomized controlled trials.
- Risk–benefit ratio must be assessed individually on a case-to-case basis.
- The minimum ‘safe’ factor levels and platelet count for neuraxial block in both the obstetric and general populations and evidence-based recommendations for neuraxial techniques in the setting of haemophilia and VWD cannot be offered.
### Obstetrics Patients with Haemophilia
- Females are usually carriers as haemophilia is an XLR disorder.
- All female relatives of a patient with haemophilia must be screened to document FVIII level.
- Once the carriers are identified, they must be educated and counselled about the risk of having a child with haemophilia and other reproductive options.
- Patients should be managed with a multidisciplinary team right from the antenatal period.
- Sex of the child and haemophilia status may be identified by polymerase chain reaction around 10 weeks of gestation or by ultrasound around 18–20 weeks.
- Factor VIII and IX levels must be measured immediately before delivery and postpartum
	- aim to maintain above 0.5 IU/ml.
- Controversies exist about the mode of delivery.
- Instrumental delivery poses a high risk of intracranial haemorrhage in a fetus with confirmed haemophilia status.
- Elective Caesarean section must be debated individually according to the risk to mother and child taking into consideration the haemophilia status of the fetus.
- There is no contraindication to normal vaginal delivery
	- prolonged labour must be avoided.
- No evidence that routine ultrasound screening or prophylactic administration of clotting factors reduces the risk of intracranial haemorrhage in the newborn.
### Labour Analgesia
- Risk of neuraxial analgesia must be assessed individually after checking platelet and factor VIII levels (>0.5 IU/ml).
- Other options:
	- remifentanil patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with continuous monitoring of heart rate and oxygen saturation.
## Von Willebrand's Disease
- In pregnancy, VWF begins to increase from 6 weeks of gestation and increases by threeto four-fold by the third trimester.
- Levels of VWF must be assessed at 34–36 weeks in type 1 and 2 VWD.
- VWF activity (VWF:RCo) >40 IU/dl is required for safe vaginal delivery and >50 IU/dl for Caesarean section.
- Post-Caesarean section patients usually need treatment with DDAVP or VWF concentrates for a week to maintain haemostasis.
	- Patients with post-partum haemorrhage must receive active management with suitable replacement therapy.
	- Monitoring of VWF and factor VIII must be done within 24 h postpartum as levels of VWF decline rapidly back to baseline.
### Labour Analgesia
- Epidural analgesia may be considered in type1 VWD after evaluation of coagulation profile and VWF levels.
- The risk–benefit ratio must be assessed and must be performed by a senior anaesthetist.
- Epidural anaesthesia is not recommended in type 2 or 3 VWD.
## Other Recessively Inherited Coagulation Disorders
- Deficiency of fibrinogen, prothrombin, clotting factors V, VII, X, XI, and XIII are recessively inherited and are very rare
	- prevalence ranging from one in two million for factor II (prothrombin) and factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency to one in 500 000 for factor VII (FVII) deficiency.
	- Replacement factors such as fibrinogen concentrates (RiaSTAPw), rFVIIa (NovoSevenw), and F XIII (Corifactw) are available and must be considered along with the use of PCC and cryoprecipitate.
### Inherited Clotting Disorders (thrombophilias)
- Thrombotic and embolic events cause significant mortality and morbidity.
- Thrombotic tendency can be caused by inherited or acquired defects in the clotting cascade.
- Venous thrombosis has annual incidence of one in 1000.
- Deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S account usually for,5% of venous thrombosis in all age groups.
#### Inherited Thrombophilias

![[6D2E7F82-176E-452A-9DD2-E2EA450E2EA2.jpeg]]

#### Antithrombin Deficiency
- Antithrombin functions by:
	- inactivating thrombin and activated factor X (primary function)
	- inactivating factors VII, IX, and XII
- The normal levels of antithrombin are 70–132% and <60% results in thrombosis.
#### Protein C and Protein S Deficiency
- Protein C mainly functions by inactivating activated factors V and VIII and stimulating plasminogen activator.
- Protein S is a cofactor of protein C
	- enhances its action.
- The normal levels of:
	- protein C: 70–164%
	- protein S: 63–160%
	- and any level below the normal is thrombotic.
#### Factor V Leiden Mutation
- Factor V mainly acts as a cofactor for activated factor X
- Activity of factor V is limited by activated protein C which degrades it.
- The factor V Leiden mutation results in resistance to activated protein C thereby causing thrombosis.
#### Abnormalities of Fibrinolytic System
- In normal subjects, plasminogen is converted to plasmin which lyses clots.
	- mainly activated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI).
- Deficiency of plasminogen, tPA, or excess of PAI may lead to a hypercoagulable state.
- Qualitative defects in fibrinogen (dysfibrinogenaemia) may also lead to thrombosis.

![[B3330E12-17EA-42DB-877F-A26E7D8FA1DB.jpeg]]

### Treatment
- Anticoagulants such as:
	- unfractionated heparin
	- low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
	- warfarin
- For specific conditions, replacement factors are available like cryoprecipitates, protein C, and antithrombin.
- Fresh-frozen plasma is rarely used as a source of anticoagulants and may be used in the case of their deficiency.
- Consideration should be given to preoperative placement of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in high-risk patients undergoing high-risk surgery with anticipated prolonged immobility.
### Preoperative Assessment
- Detailed coagulation screen must be done to evaluate the diagnosis and to monitor treatment as patients are on anticoagulation.
- Decision to administer fresh-frozen plasma before surgery must be done in consultation with the haematologist.
	- Fresh-frozen plasma is only used for factor V deficiency and plasma exchange in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and haemolytic uraemic syndrome.
### General Principles
- As for bleeding disorders:
	- multidisciplinary team management
	- elective scheduled surgery
	- ultrasound for vascular access
	- multimodal analgesia.
- Preoperative clotting screen/anti-Xa levels depending on the medication used to bridge perioperative anticoagulation.
- Bridging therapy with unfractionated/LMWHs for high-risk patients.
- Avoid dehydration and promote early mobilization
- Use of mechanical compression devices.
### Anaesthetic Considerations
- Choice of GA vs regional anaesthesia should be individualized as per patient and surgery.
- Guidelines exist for regional anaesthesia in a patient on anticoagulation by American and European societies of regional anaesthesia.
- In high-risk patients, warfarin must be converted to heparin before surgery with monitoring of coagulation.
- Use of mechanical measures like graduated elastic stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices must be used.
- A plan for restarting anticoagulants after surgery must be discussed with the surgeons and haematologist.
# Guidelines for Neonatal and Paediatric Transfusion
## Introduction
- Paediatric surgical patients often require volume replacement with blood or blood products during the perioperative period.
- Hypovolaemia secondary to blood loss is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this population.
- Blood is crucial for:
	- Oxygen delivery
	- Metabolism of drugs
	- Immunity
- Significant changes in circulating blood volume and cellular constituents affect basic functions and cardiovascular properties, necessitating prompt treatment of hypovolaemia.
- Transfusion of blood products in paediatric patients carries higher risks of harm and complications compared to adults.
- Risks of transfusion can be infectious or non-infectious, with non-infectious risks posing greater chances of transfusion reactions and increased mortality.
- The three leading causes of mortality from transfusion are:
	- Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)
	- Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)
	- Haemolytic transfusion reactions (HTR)
- Acute transfusion reactions can range from mild (urticaria) to severe (fever, rigors, sepsis, anaphylactic reactions, TRALI, TACO, HTR).
- The number of patients needing transfusions is increasing, while the donor pool is either unchanged or decreasing.
- Given the risks and potential life-threatening complications, guidelines to assess the appropriateness of paediatric transfusions are essential.
## Physiological and Haematological Variances from Adults
- **Neonate's Haemostatic System**:
	- Not well developed at birth; matures during infancy.
- **Physiological Characteristics in Children**:
	- Higher rates of cardiac output and circulating blood volume.
	- Increased oxygen consumption.
	- Higher metabolic rate.
- **Neonatal Haemoglobin Levels**:
	- Affected by the timing of umbilical cord clamping.
	- Reach a steady state by age 2-3 months.
	- Higher haemoglobin concentration if cord clamping is delayed.
	- Deteriorates by age 3 months due to reduced red cell production.
- **Foetal Haemoglobin (Hb F)**:
	- Constitutes 70% of total Hb in term infants.
	- Higher affinity for oxygen, causing a leftwards shift in the oxygen haemoglobin dissociation curve.
	- Reduces oxygen delivery to tissues.
- **Platelet Count in Neonates**:
	- Born with relatively normal platelet count.
	- Platelet function may be impaired for the first 2-3 weeks of life.
- **Coagulation Factors**:
	- Low levels of procoagulant proteins.
	- Dysfunctional fibrinogen and plasminogen.
	- Higher risk of bleeding compared to adults due to prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT).

## Transfusion Thresholds
- Transfusion threshold describes the minimum haemoglobin level at which a transfusion is considered, balancing between severe anaemia and the risk of morbidity and mortality from unnecessary donor blood exposure.
- A haemodynamically stable, healthy child can tolerate a haemoglobin level drop to 7-8 g/dL with normal cardiac output and adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
- Oxygen delivery to tissues (DO2) is a product of arterial oxygen content (CaO2) and cardiac output.
	- Normally, if haemoglobin concentration decreases, CaO2 also decreases, but DO2 remains stable due to increased cardiac output.
	- If the lower limit of haemoglobin is breached, compensation fails, leading to diminished DO2 and increased oxygen extraction.
- Normovolaemia can be maintained using crystalloids and colloids.
	- Crystalloids are better for interstitial losses as they reach the interstitium faster.
	- Colloids are more suited for intravascular losses.
- Unnecessary fluid resuscitation should be avoided due to potential harm and should be physiologically guided.
- A practical method for prescribing intravenous fluids, the “4-2-1 rule,” was developed for paediatric patients based on estimated metabolic needs at rest.
	- In theory, an awake child needs 1 ml of water to metabolise 1 kcal.
	- The “4-2-1 rule”: weight based rule for maintenance fluid.
		- accounts for insensible skin, respiratory, and urinary losses.
#### Transfusion Thresholds

#### 4-2-1 Rule and Daily Maintenance Fluid according to Weight

![[680127D4-CD8E-4154-957D-F620BD095C9D_4_5005_c.jpeg]]

### Maximum Allowable Blood Loss
- The anaesthetist needs to estimate the amount of blood a patient can lose before requiring a transfusion.
- This estimation is done using the child’s circulating blood volume and a mathematical equation.
- Formula:
	- MABL = EBV x (HbI–Hbt) / Hbav
	- MABL: Maximum allowable blood loss
	- EBV: Estimated blood volume (weight in kg x blood volume in ml/kg)
	- HbI: Initial haemoglobin
	- Hbt: Threshold haemoglobin
	- Hbav: Average haemoglobin HbI + Hbt/2
- The original equation used initial haemoglobin as the denominator, but studies showed haemodilution reduced haemoglobin loss with the use of crystalloids or colloids.
- Ongoing blood loss can be replaced with:
	- Crystalloid at a 3:1 volume ratio
	- Colloid at a 1:1 ratio
- When MABL is reached, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion should begin.

![[4B3E3D38-A94C-4CE8-A700-28FB9C6006DA.jpeg]]

### Assessing Blood Loss
- Inspect surgical field, floor, and drapes.
- Evaluate swabs by weighing them and measure volume in suction bottles.
- Assess cardiovascular indices: heart rate, blood pressure, central and peripheral temperature, and capillary refill time.
- Measure central venous pressure (use trends rather than single values).
- Monitor arterial pressure waveform.
- Monitor cardiac output (trends are more valuable than isolated figures).
- Check biochemistry: lactate level > 4mmol/l and base deficit > -4 (indicators of poor tissue perfusion).
- Determine extraction ratio (ER) by sampling arterial and venous blood at organ outflow.
	- ER = (Pa–Pv) / Pa
	- Pa: concentration in the renal artery
	- Pv: concentration in the renal vein
### Massive Blood Loss and Massive Transfusion
- Defined as the loss of one or more circulating blood volumes within 24 hours or half the volume within three hours.
- Massive blood loss can lead to coagulopathy secondary to haemorrhage.
- Early management with blood products (FFP/FDP, platelets, packed red cells) improves patient outcomes.
- Guidelines suggest considering FFP/FFD and cryoprecipitate when over 50% of blood volume is replaced with red cells.
- Mandatory use of FFP/FFD and cryoprecipitate when more than 120%-150% of blood volume is replaced.
- Massive transfusion protocols for paediatric patients are underdeveloped but show satisfactory results where implemented.
- Massive transfusion in adults is roughly equivalent to 10 units of packed red blood cells.
- Combined with crystalloid infusions, massive transfusions can cause irreversible coagulopathies.
- Avoid hypothermia, hypovolaemia, acid-base abnormalities, and ensure correction of electrolyte abnormalities.
- Protocols aim to provide a balanced amount of blood products to treat haemorrhagic shock and coagulopathy and should be available in all hospitals.

![[D8E8629D-408D-4048-86AE-3D3991FC8720.jpeg]]

### Transfusion of Blood Products
#### Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusion
- Perform a preoperative full blood count to evaluate haemoglobin, haematocrit, and reticulocyte count.
- Transfuse RBC based on restrictive haemoglobin levels.
- Infants under 4 months must have type-specific or O negative blood.
- RBC transfusion increases arterial oxygen content and delivery to tissues.
- Autologous blood transfusion carries less risk than allogenic blood; preoperative autologous donation is beneficial but challenging in paediatrics.
- Use small volume red cell transfusions (10-20 ml/kg) as suggested by the South African National Blood Service.
- For infants, a complete crossmatch is not essential if no clinically significant antibodies are present and the direct antiglobulin test is negative; reconfirm ABO and Rh-D group for each transfusion.
#### Blood Component Therapy
##### Platelets
- Indicated for acute bleed with >40% blood volume loss or for invasive procedures with platelet count < 50 x 10^9/l.
- Strongly consider administering platelets under these circumstances:
	- <1000g and <1 week old
	- Clinically unstable (labile blood pressure)
	- Previous major bleeding
	- Current minor bleeding
	- Coagulopathy
	- Planned surgery or exchange transfusion
	- Major bleeding with platelet count < 100 x 10^9/l
- Suggested dose: 1-2 units/10 kg or 10-15 ml/kg.
##### Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)
- Indicated for Vitamin K deficiency, liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or dilutional coagulopathy with coagulation factor deficiency.
- Suggested dose: 1 unit/10 kg or 10-15 ml/kg.
##### Cryoprecipitate
- Contains 80 units of factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, factor XIII, fibrinogen (150-250 mg), and fibrinonectin.
- Indicated when fibrinogen levels fall below 150 mg/dl with active or microvascular bleeding or massive bleeding.
- Suggested dose: 1 unit per 5-10 kg body weight.

![[513F9362-A91A-4F65-A156-1D26EBE4F61D.jpeg]]

### Complications of Massive Blood Transfusion

- **General Considerations**
	- One unit of packed RBC can be equal to a child’s entire circulating volume, leading to frequent complications such as:
		- hyperkalaemia
		- metabolic acidosis
		- hypomagnesaemia
		- hypocalcaemia
		- variations in the haemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve.
- **Hyperkalaemia**
	- Serious complication due to old stored RBCs causing cardiac arrhythmias and arrest.
	- Recommended to use RBC collected within a week and transfuse at 1 ml/kg/min.
	- Treatments: 1 meq/kg sodium bicarbonate, 60 mg/kg calcium gluconate, or 20 mg/kg calcium chloride intravenously.
- **Hypocalcaemia**
	- Higher risk in children with liver dysfunction due to citrate in stored blood.
	- Managed with 5-10 mg/kg calcium chloride or 15-30 mg/kg calcium gluconate.
- **Hypomagnesaemia**
	- Important for stabilizing the membrane potential and maintaining cardiac stability
		- treat arrhythmias with 25-50 mg/kg magnesium sulfate.
- **Hypothermia**
	- Children are prone due to larger surface area compared to body weight.
	- Can lead to hypoglycaemia, apnoea, reduced drug metabolism, decreased oxygen delivery, and worsening coagulopathy.
	- Ultimately, hypothermia may result in death.
### Interventions to Reduce Perioperative Bleeding

- **Antifibrinolytics**
	- Tranexamic acid (20 mg/kg bolus and 10 mg/kg/hr infusion) decreases blood loss by inhibiting activation of plasminogen to plasmin.
- **Desmopressin**
	- Stimulates release of von Willebrand factor, increasing vWF and factor VIII levels, affecting platelet activity through its adhesion to the vascular wall.
	- Recommended dose: 0.3 μg/kg IVI.
- **Recombinant Factor VII**
	- Reserved for refractory and uncontrollable bleeding due to controversy in paediatric use.
- **Fibrinogen Concentrate**
	- Indicated for perioperative and traumatic bleeding and in patients with liver failure (impaired fibrinogen synthesis).
- **Prothrombin Complex**
	- Contains factors II, VII, IX, X, Protein S, and Protein C.
	- Used to reverse Warfarin and treat bleeding in haemophiliac patients, as well as perioperative bleeding refractive to use of FFP, platelets and cryoprecipitate.
	- Recommended dose: 20-30 UI/kg.
### Alternatives to Blood Transfusion
- Blood conservation strategies to reduce transfusion risks include:
	- Acute normovolaemic haemodilution
	- Antifibrinolytics
	- Controlled hypotension
	- Intraoperative cell saver use
	- Preoperative autologous donations
# Blood Sparing Techniques in Paediatric Anaesthesia
### Introduction
- Blood-sparing techniques:
	- Aim to reduce blood loss
	- Minimize the need for blood and blood product transfusions
	- Implemented through a multidisciplinary and multimodal approach
- Reasons for blood conservation strategies:
	- **Risks and Side Effects of Blood Transfusion:**
		- Infectious risks
		- Non-infectious risks
	- **Low Supply of Blood Products:**
		- Few donors
		- Short storage time for paediatric patients
	- **Refusal of Transfusions:**
		- Religious reasons
		- Personal reasons
## Blood Transfusion

![[6F268080-123E-4FE6-8817-E39BD58512CF.jpeg]]

### Risks and Side Effects of Blood Transfusion

- **Differences between Countries**
	- Developing countries: transfusion-transmissible infections predominate.
	- Industrialised countries: Main issues are immunological reactions, overtransfusion, and clerical errors.
- **Safety Improvements**
	- Overall safety of blood components has increased, especially in industrialised countries, mainly concerning infection risks.
	- Non-infectious risks remain significant, particularly in the paediatric population.
- **Incidence of Adverse Outcomes**
	- Infants: 37 per 100,000 RBC issued
	- Children (<18 years): 18 per 100,000 RBC issued
	- Adults: 13 per 100,000 RBC issued (Serious Hazards of Transfusion SHOT data, UK)
- **Higher Risk for Children**
	- Children experience a higher incidence of adverse events and worse outcomes compared to adults.
- **Minimising Transfusions**
	- Blood transfusions should be kept to a minimum.
	- Only administer transfusions after carefully considering the risks and benefits.
### Perioperative Blood Conservation Strategies

- **General Considerations**
	- Blood conservation begins long before the operation.
	- Health professionals should be aware of transfusion risks and avoid unnecessary, inappropriate, and over-transfusion.
	- Strategies to decrease blood use carry risks and costs.
	- Most methods are available for children, with efficiency depending on patient age and type of surgery.
- **Classification of Strategies**
	1. **Increasing Pre-operative Red Blood Cell Mass**
	2. **Decreasing Peri-operative Blood Losses**
	3. **Optimizing Transfusion Practice**
- **Approach and Application**
	- Combining all three strategies is best, based on individual patient risk assessment and surgery type.
	- Higher expected blood loss increases the benefit from blood-conservation strategies.
	- Some techniques are universally applicable (e.g., clean surgical technique, pressure dressings).
	- Specialized techniques (e.g., pre-operative autologous donation) may be limited to specialist centres with proper logistical support.
- **Specific Applications**
	- Strategies vary with the type of surgery
		- major blood-conservation techniques are more beneficial in surgeries with high expected blood loss (e.g., cardiac, craniofacial, scoliosis surgery).
### Optimizing Transfusion Practice

- **Adoption of Restrictive Transfusion Triggers**
	- Regular audit of transfusion policies and algorithms reduces blood transfusion without increasing adverse events.
	- Optimal transfusion threshold in children is unclear and varies by situation.
- **Considerations for Acute Blood Loss in Theatre**
	- Adolescents and adults compensate with increased cardiac output.
	- Smaller children have limited ability to increase cardiac contractility:
		- increase heart rate to compensate for blood loss.
	- Infants <4-6 months should be transfused at 20-25% blood volume loss; older children and adults at 30-35% blood volume loss.
- **Decision Factors for Transfusion**
	- Ongoing blood loss (speed, amount, duration of surgery).
	- Pre-existing conditions (e.g., cardiac malformations, previous cardiac surgery).
	- Signs of end-organ impairment (e.g., oliguria).
	- Rapid blood loss requires quick haemoglobin assessment (e.g., Haemocue or blood gases).
		- blood gases have advantage of providing glucose, lactate and electrolytes.
- **Transfusion in Anaemic Patients Without Acute Blood Loss**
	- Maintain tissue perfusion and oxygenation.
	- No absolute numbers regarding haemoglobin or haematocrit.
		- Consider age, pre-existing disease, and clinical condition.
- **General Transfusion Thresholds**
	- Same transfusion threshold used for normovolaemic infants over 4-6months of age as children, adolescents and adults.
	- Restrictive transfusion policy using a haemoglobin threshold of 70g/l is not associated with increased morbidity or mortality in postsurgical PICU patients over 4-6 months.
	- For ventilated neonates with FiO2<0.35 and premature babies, a transfusion threshold of haemoglobin 100g/l is recommended.
	- For babies with cyanotic heart disease, congestive heart failure or children with a FiO2 requirement >0.35, the haemoglobin threshold might be up to 120g/l.
- **Detailed Transfusion Policy**
	- Include pre-operative optimization advice (e.g., anaemia, medications).
	- Applicable to both operating department and ward level.
	- Emphasize standardized multidisciplinary transfusion algorithms.
### Preoperative

- **Patient Factors to Assess**
	- Starting haemoglobin/haematocrit, adjusted for age and weight.
	- Co-morbidities (e.g., cardiac, pulmonary, diabetes, renal, gastroenterology problems).
	- Pre-operative treatment with anticoagulants.
	- Clinical signs of anaemia or hypovolaemia.
	- Type of surgery (Surgeries with high expected blood loss: craniofacial, scoliosis, cardiac with high expected blood loss).
	- Modifiable risk factors should be addressed prior to surgery:
		- correct anaemia or hypovolaemia
		- stop anticoagulants if possible
		- discuss any problems that might have arisen with the appropriate specialist (cardiologist, haematologist, surgeon, etc).
- **Medication**
	- Children may be on coagulation-interfering drugs (e.g., aspirin, warfarin).
		- Particularly children with cardiac abnormalities.
		- May not be possible to stop due to underlying condition such as in shunts or artificial valves
	- Decisions on stopping anticoagulants should weigh risks of thrombo-embolism against bleeding risks.
		- The clinical team responsible for the perioperative care of the patient (cardiologist, haematologist, anaesthetist, surgeon) must discuss the pros and cons of stopping anticoagulants.
	- Common anti-platelet drugs: aspirin (usually not stopped before minor surgery).
		- Benefits usually outweigh the perceived bleeding risks.
		- If it can be stopped, it should be stopped 5-7 days before surgery.
		- Platelet function tests are not necessary.
	- Newer anti-platelet drugs:
		- Examples:
			- ADP receptor inhibitors (Clopidogrel, Ticlopidin)
			- Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors (Abciximab).
		- Usually prescribed alongside aspirin
			- decision has to be made whether both can be continued, both stopped, aspirin alone continued or a replacement medication started (heparin).
			- Decision should be made by the cardiologist, haematologist, surgeon and anaesthetist on a case-by-case basis.
			- There aren’t enough studies in the paediatric patients to support a recommendation for all cases at the moment
	- Most common oral anticoagulant used in children is warfarin
		- vitamin K antagonist.
	- Newer oral anticoagulants:
		- direct inhibition of thrombin (Dabigatran, Ximelagatran)
		- direct inhibition of Factor Xa (Rivaroxaban).
	- These drugs have been shown in adults to be as effective as warfarin with a better safety profile.
	- If a patient is on a new anticoagulant, a paediatric haematologist should be consulted about the stopping or changing of the drugs perioperatively.
	- If anticoagulation needs to be continued, a detailed plan about the management of the medication needs to be made and communicated clearly to all members of the team, including the patient and the parents.
	- In patients receiving warfarin, anticoagulation usually needs to be continued, and so is changed perioperatively to an IV heparin infusion (unfractionated heparin), which has a shorter half-life.
		- Patients can therefore be anticoagulated until shortly before the operation starts.
- The following is a guideline describing how to change warfarin to heparin:
	- Day 3 before surgery:
		- Take last dose of warfarin
	- Day 2 before surgery:
		- Omit warfarin
	- Day before surgery:
		- Give loading dose of 100U/kg of unfractionated heparin, followed by an infusion of heparin 25U/kg/hr.
		- Check APTT 4hrs after start of heparin; it should be 60-90 sec.
		- If the APTT is too low, increase the heparin infusion by 10% and re-check after 4 hrs.
		- If desired APTT is reached, do daily APTT levels.
	- Day of surgery:
		- Check INR: for most surgery INR should be <2; if higher, consult with surgeon/ haematologist/cardiologist
		- Stop heparin 4hrs before surgery.
			- In some cases where there will be a long period of time preparing the child for surgery
				- repeat cardiac operations
				- some surgeons are happy for the heparin to be stopped on arrival in the anaesthetic room, with skin incision approximately 1.5 hrs afterwards
				- Re-start heparin 1-2 hrs after surgery
					- continue with heparin infusion as instructed by the surgeon
				- If no other instruction: start usual warfarin dose 24hrs post-surgery
	- Day 1 postop:
		- Continue heparin infusion, give regular warfarin
	- Day 2 postop:
		- Check INR: if at normal pre-op level, stop heparin.
		- If INR too low, continue with heparin infusion and re-check INR daily. Stop heparin once INR is at desired level.\
**Anaemia**
- **Investigation and Treatment**
	- Should be investigated and treated based on the cause.
	- Treatment may delay the operation.
- **Chronic Childhood Anaemia**
	- **Industrialised Countries:** Often related to diet, cancer, or chemotherapy effects.
	- **Developing Countries:** Commonly due to:
		- malnutrition
		- parasite infestation
		- infections (e.g., malaria).
	- Use the same transfusion thresholds as acute anaemia.
- **Iron and Erythropoietin**
	- Can increase red cell mass before surgery.
	- Require a good bone marrow response to be effective.
	- **Adults:** Oral iron and erythropoietin over 2 weeks increase haemoglobin by 10g/l.
	- **Intravenous Iron:** Increases haemoglobin by up to 60g/l in adults with chronic bleeding anaemia.
	- Used to increase pre-operative haematocrit and blood units for autologous donation
**Pre-operative Autologous Blood Donation**
- **Purpose**
	- Augment blood supply.
	- Reduce risks of allogeneic transfusions, particularly alloimmunisation.
	- Greater intraoperative allowable blood loss if haematocrit is baseline or higher before surgery.
- **Administration and Risks**
	- Complex structure involving multiple specialities.
	- Risks include clerical errors and infectious contamination.
	- Typically for children >20kg, although described for those as young as 6 months.
	- Requires general anaesthetic for smaller children and adequate bone marrow
	- response.
- **Logistics**
	- Synchronize surgery with donations due to short storage time for paediatric patients.
	- High wastage (up to 64%) due to waiting lists and surgery cancellations from patient factors (e.g., colds, infections), making it inefficient for reducing perioperative blood transfusion.
### Intraoperative

- **Surgical Techniques**
	- Use vasoconstrictors
		- Adrenaline-soaked swabs or local anaesthetics with adrenaline cause vasoconstriction and therefore less blood loss
	- Tourniquets
	- Clean surgical technique
		- diathermy, ligation, fibrin patches, ultrasound
	- Pressure dressings
	- Early exploration for postoperative bleeding.
- **Acute Normovolaemic Haemodilution (ANH)**
	- Blood drawn after anaesthesia, replaced with crystalloid/colloid.
	- Reduces haematocrit which in turn reduces viscosity, improves tissue perfusion, decreases peripheral vascular resistance.
	- Transfuse collected blood back after bleeding stops.
	- Recommended for patients with multiple antibodies for whom it is often difficult to get allogenic blood crossmatched.
	- Blood is kept at room temperature
		- no side effects of cold storage, such as decreased platelet function or high potassium content.
	- The efficiency of this technique depends on the amount of blood collected and the blood volume lost by the patient.
	- Might not be applicable to very young patients as infants are less able to compensate for anaemia by increasing stroke volume compared to adults.
	- In babies younger than 6 months ANH is not recommended as the dilutional anaemia is poorly tolerated due to the presence of HbF, which has reduced ability to unload oxygen to the tissues.
	- ANH is used to good effect in adolescents for scoliosis surgery and children undergoing craniosynostosis surgery.
		- Recent meta-analysis of 42 RCT suggested only modest benefits from ANH
- **Hypervolaemic Haemodilution (HH)**
	- Dilution of blood volume without withdrawing blood first.
		- achieved with colloid (approximately 10-15ml/kg)
	- Effective in reducing allogeneic blood transfusion.
- **Controlled Hypotension**
	- Lowering blood pressure, usually to 50-60mmHg, to decrease intraoperative blood loss.
	- Various drugs described to do this
		- in paediatric anaesthesia deepening of the anaesthetic with anaesthetic vapours or TIVA is usually sufficient
		- In PICU, beta blockers, nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, nicardipine have been used to good effect.
	- Inexpensive and effective but has limitations:
		- hypovolaemia
		- elevated ICP
		- decreased end-organ blood flow
	- Hypocapnia should be avoided and a higher FiO2used to assist oxygen delivery.
- **Cell Salvage and Autotransfusion**
	- Used in surgeries with major blood loss (e.g., cardiac, craniofacial, scoliosis).
	- Decreases necessity and volume of transfusions.
	- Small centrifugation bowls have been introduced, so that the technique is now safe and efficient method to use, even in infants <10kg and /or <1 yr of age. The system can be run continuously in operations with major ongoing blood loss.
	- Can be done postoperatively from drains with aseptic collection.
- **Antifibrinolytics**
	- Controversial but effective in reducing perioperative blood loss.
	- Drugs: tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid.
		- A 2008 Cochrane Review of studies in scoliosis surgery looking at aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid showed that all three antifibrinolytics decreased the amount of blood transfusions.
		- The authors recommended a high dose regimen for all 3 drugs, as these were the regimens used in the studies included in the review and found no adverse effects.
		- Another study looked at tranexamic acid vs placebo in scoliosis surgery: it showed that estimated blood loss (EBL) was reduced in the TEA group compared with placebo, although the amount of transfused blood did not differ
### Postoperative

- **Monitoring and Management**
	- Postoperative blood losses after major surgery such as cardiac, major orthopaedic surgery or craniofacial reconstruction can be significant.
	- Pressure dressings and drains can be deceiving as bleeding can occur obliquely into the body, into the thoracic or abdominal cavity or soft tissue.
	- Drains can be blocked by blood clots.
	- Vigilance for blood loss.
		- Early decision for surgical second look in case of ongoing or abnormal bleeding avoids unnecessary transfusions
	- Correct abnormal clotting with medications (e.g., vitamin K, calcium, antifibrinolytics).
	- Augment postoperative anaemia with iron and erythropoietin.
	- Use cell saver systems for postoperative blood salvage.
### Future Alternatives to Blood Transfusion

- **Investigated Alternatives**
	- Cell-free, haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers.
	- Artificial red cells (liposomes, encapsulated nanoparticles).
	- Fluorocarbon-based oxygen solutions.
	- Universal red cells (modified human red cells).
	- Stem cell-derived red cells (promising but under research for mass production and potential adverse effects).
# Anaesthetic Management of the Child with Haematological Malignancy
### Overview

- **Incidence and Impact**
	- 1400 new cases of childhood cancer annually in the UK.
	- Affects 1 in 600 children by age 14.
	- Haematological malignancy accounts for 45% of cases.
	- Increasing incidence of leukaemia with a 5-year survival rate around 85%.
### Care of Immunocompromised Children

- **Frequent Immunocompromise**
	- Children with haematological malignancy are often immunocompromised.
	- Higher risk of neutropenic bacteraemia in children with leukaemia.
- **Causes of Reduced Immune Function**
	- Disease process affecting production of cells required for immunocompetence.
	- Treatment effects (chemotherapy or radiotherapy).
	- Coexisting conditions and congenital abnormalities (e.g., Fanconi anaemia, neurofibromatosis, Noonan syndrome).
	- Latent infections (e.g., EBV, CMV).

![[ACBDDBDE-03BA-485C-AC7F-A4C8C1EB12CC.jpeg]]

### Infection Control Measures

- **Strategies for Reducing Infection Risk**
	- Standard infection control (strict hand hygiene, minimizing contact with known infective cases: chicken pox, measles, respiratory tract and GI infections).
	- Schedule immunocompromised children before infective cases on operating lists.
	- Obtain a full blood count (FBC) before anaesthesia to check neutrophil count, anaemia, or thrombocytopenia.
	- Carefully consider the use of regional anaesthetic techniques and avoid intramuscular injections.
		- can lead to abscess formation.
	- Maintain skin integrity, take care when instrumenting the airway.
	- Avoid rectal trauma when inserting temperature probes
		- Possibly refrain from using rectally administered medication.
### Care of Central Venous Lines (CVC)

- **Use and Risks**
	- Commonly used for chemotherapy, blood sampling, and hydration.
	- Sources of infection:
		- skin
		- direct contact of the catheter or hub by an infected source (hand/fluid)
		- haematological seeding from another source
		- contaminated infusion fluid or drug solution
- **Infection Reduction Measures**
	- Staff and patient education.
	- Aseptic insertion with chlorhexidine skin preparation.
	- Disinfection of catheter hubs.
	- Removal of unnecessary connectors.
	- Replacement of administration sets every 72–96 hours.
	- Assessment and care of entrance/exit sites.
	- Use of transparent semi-permeable dressings and prompt replacement if damp/soiled.
	- Consideration of inhalation induction to reduce infection risk (avoid using indwelling line altogether)
- **Steps During Indwelling Line Use for Induction**
	- Keep pre-drawn drugs in a clean tray with covered syringe hubs.
	- Wear gloves and clean access ports with chlorhexidine wipes.
	- Flush the line with normal saline post-procedure and document the flush to ensure no residual drug in the cannula or connectors.
## Anaesthesia for Common Procedures
### Bone Marrow biopsy/harvest
- Used to:
	- diagnose leukaemia
	- monitor response to treatment
- Cells obtained from aspirates are analysed using microscopic morphological evaluation.
- Samples obtained from the trephine biopsy are used to evaluate cellularity of the marrow and to exclude marrow involvement by lymphoma.
- Bone marrow harvest performed as treatment for leukaemia.
	- Harvested cells can later be re-infused into the child to reestablish cell production after high-dose chemotherapy.
	- It can be either autologous (cells frozen) or allogenic.
	- Complex ethical issue.
	- Children who are deemed Gillick competent are able to consent to donate.
	- In cases where the donor child is unable to give consent, someone with parental responsibility can provide consent on their behalf.
	- Before this, however, at least in the UK, there must be involvement with an accredited assessor/patient advocate from the Human Tissue Authority.
- The preferred site for obtaining bone marrow in children posterior superior iliac crests:
	- Contain the most accessible marrow
	- Are non-weight bearing
	- Performing the procedure at this site has a low potential for damaging other important structures.
- The child is normally placed in the prone or lateral decubitus position.
- Bone marrow biopsy is a short procedure
- Bone marrow harvests can take between 60 and 90 min.
- Preoperative assessment for bone marrow biopsy:
	- Know the underlying (or suspected) diagnosis
	- Whether the child is undergoing active treatment
	- Results of a recent FBC.
- In cases of severe thrombocytopenia, a bone marrow biopsy can be taken:
	- Apply sufficient local pressure afterwards to achieve haemostasis.
- A spontaneously breathing anaesthetic technique supplemented by local anaesthetic infiltration of the wound with the addition of simple analgesia is usually acceptable.
- Avoid NSAIDs if the platelet count is particularly low.
- For autologous bone marrow harvest, in addition to the preoperative assessment above, obtain a group-and-save sample.
- Prolonged procedure in the prone position:
	- Most anaesthetists will intubate and ventilate the child.
- Up to 10% of the patients’ bone marrow may be harvested
	- Could result in anaemia and hypovolaemia.
		- Fluid resuscitation will be required.
		- Blood transfusion should be delayed until after the procedure as the transfused red blood cells can contaminate the harvested marrow.
### Long Term Venous Access
- Required for regular blood tests and administration of chemotherapy.
	- The requesting oncologist makes the choice of line.
		- Subcutaneously placed port devices more convenient for short intermittent use
		- Tunnelled lines (e.g. Hickman lines) preferable if the child needs venous access very frequently.
	- Risks:
		- infection
		- thrombosis
		- leakage
		- dislodgement
	- Often require more than one line during a prolonged course of treatment.
		- Central veins should be preserved and not used indiscriminately for routine perioperative access.
- Preoperative assessment:
	- Coagulation status
	- Platelet count
	- Assess vascular anatomy and patency of vessels with ultrasound
		- particularly if the child has had multiple lines in the past.
- I.V. or inhalational induction
	- depends on the preference of the child, parents, and the anaesthetist.
- Tracheal tube preferred in smaller children due to:
	- the position of the neck
	- proximity of the operator to the airway
- Laryngeal masks suitable in the older child
	- Inflated cuff may distort the vascular anatomy
- Analgesia:
	- Paracetamol
	- Local anaesthetic infiltration at the insertion point
	- Small dose of short-acting opioid perioperatively usually required.
### Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy
- Chemo normally a combination of at least two cytotoxic drugs.
- Many children with leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) require intrathecal chemotherapy
	- For most cases, GA is required.
- Most commonly used drugs:
	- Cytarabine
	- Methotrexate in conjunction with hydrocortisone.
- Side-effects:
	- Nausea and vomiting
	- Organ toxicity
	- Risk of secondary malignancy.
- Anaesthetists should never be involved in performing the lumbar puncture or the administration of intrathecal chemotherapy.
	- Before 2001, there were at least 14 cases of doctors, including anaesthetists, incorrectly administering the i.v. chemotherapy drug vincristine via the intrathecal route, resulting in death or paralysis of the patients.
- Before induction, establish whether the oncologist or nursing staff wish to carry out any other procedures such as:
	- blood tests
	- bone marrow biopsy
	- placement of a nasogastric tube
	- dressing changes at the same
- Many of these children have long-term venous access
	- IV induction is preferable.
	- Use aseptic technique when using these lines.
- Lumbar puncture and administration of intrathecal chemotherapy is a brief procedure.
	- Anaesthesia can be provided via a mask using an inhalation spontaneously breathing technique
		- alternative is use propofol and remifentanil.
- Radiotherapy used as curative and palliative measure for children with haematological malignancy.
	- Curative regimes: low daily dose of radiotherapy over 5–6 weeks
	- Palliation: Single high-dose therapy
- Drawbacks of Radiotherapy:
	- Tumour lysis may be provoked
	- Longterm risk of a secondary malignancy developing.
- Children receiving radiotherapy should remain completely immobile to ensure correct localization of the treatment.
	- General anaesthetic often required, especially in the younger child.
	- Older children may tolerate the treatment awake with suitable preparation from the play therapist.
	- Radiotherapy to the head and neck: custom-made plastic shells for the patient to lie in are produced before treatment.
		- Similar moulds can be made for other parts of the body.
	- Treatment takes no more than 10–15 min.
- Radiotherapy suite is unfamiliar and remote environment.
	- Access to piped gases and monitoring is limited
	- Readily available emergency assistance limited.
	- Remote monitoring during the procedure to prevent exposure of the anaesthetic team to radiation.
		- conventional minimal monitoring supplemented by camera surveillance.
- The decision to sedate or fully anaesthetize the child is a decision for the anaesthetist.
	- Usually day case procedures
		- utilize methods associated with minimal hangover effects.
	- Most anaesthetists use a laryngeal mask airway to reduce the risk of supraglottic swelling associated with repeated daily intubations.
	- If child needs to be in the prone position for their radiotherapy, a tracheal tube is usually preferred for increased airway security.
	- Antiemetics recommended
		- Nausea is a well-recognized side-effect of raditherapy
		- Due to the risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), dexamethasone should be avoided.
	- Minimize stress for the child and parents:
		- Radiotherapy lists should follow a set structure
		- Should be carried out in the morning to allow the child to recover, eat, and go home as soon as possible.
- Oral mucositis:
	- Common complication of chemoradiotherapy
	- Occurs in 40–70%7 of children receiving treatment.
	- Manifested by:
		- Inflammation
		- Ulceration
		- In severe cases, there may be bleeding of the mucous membranes. I
	- Establish the presence of mucositis before anaesthesia:
		- Airway management may be difficult
		- Instrumentation may lead to bleeding
			- Troublesome in the presence of a co-existing coagulopathy.
### The Child with an Anterior Mediastinal Mass

- **Common Associations:**
	- Seen in children with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin’s disease, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
	- Almost 50% of children with Hodgkin’s disease have a mediastinal mass at diagnosis.
- **Anatomical and Clinical Concerns:**
	- Anterior mediastinal masses present significant perioperative risks due to proximity to the heart, major vessels (SVC), and airways.
	- Symptoms can be divided into respiratory and cardiovascular categories.
	- Nearly 50% of masses are asymptomatic at presentation

![[C2AB094E-E5B8-41C3-AAF6-7A4E4BDF511E_4_5005_c 2.jpeg]]

- **Respiratory Involvement:**
	- More common with anterior mediastinal masses.
	- Potential involvement of heart and great vessels leading to pericardial effusion and tamponade.
	- Aorta usually spared due to its position and pressure.
- **Symptom Severity and Risk:**
	- Severity of symptoms may not correlate with compression degree.
	- > 50% tracheal compression indicates anaesthetic risk.
	- Significant compromise can occur without tracheal compression.
	- Airway compression may only be evident in the supine position.
	- Syncope from vessel compression may occur during Valsalva manoeuvre.
- **Pre-Anaesthesia Tumour Shrinkage:**
	- Severe symptoms or superior vena cava obstruction ideally managed with tumour shrinkage before anaesthesia.
	- High-dose steroids or radiotherapy may be used, though they may complicate histological diagnosis.
- **Non-Anaesthetic Diagnostic Approaches:**
	- Peripheral blood films, local anaesthetic tissue sampling (bone marrow, pleural fluid, lymph node biopsy) can be considered.
	- Techniques may involve risks, especially with intravenous sedation.
- **Pre-Anaesthesia Assessment:**
	- Comprehensive history, examination, and low threshold for suspecting compressive symptoms.
	- Diagnostic imaging (chest X-ray, CT/MRI, echocardiography, pulmonary function tests) to establish mass extent.
	- Flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy under local anaesthesia recommended.
- **Anaesthetic Strategies:**
	- Performing this procedure under local anaesthetic is preferable, as the complication rate for these children undergoing general anaesthesia may be as high as 19.6%.
	- Minimize complications with anti-sialagogue agents, gas induction in head-up/lateral position, maintaining spontaneous ventilation, and awake extubation.
	- Positive pressure ventilation can cause cardiorespiratory collapse due to reduced venous return.
- **Emergency Management:**
	- Airway compromise or reduced cardiac output may improve in lateral or prone position.
	- Fibreoptic equipment should be available; consider using a rigid bronchoscope for distal airway obstruction.
### Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS)

- **Definition:**
	- Metabolic derangement from tumour breakdown, releasing intracellular components (cations, anions, nucleic acid metabolites, and proteins) into the bloodstream.
	- Occurs spontaneously or post-treatment (cytotoxic therapy, steroids, radiotherapy).
- **Common Associations:**
	- High tumour burden
	- Tumors highly sensitive to treatments
	- Rapid proliferation.
	- Most common in Burkitt’s lymphoma (up to 42% incidence).
- **Biochemical Changes:**
	- **Hyperuricaemia:** Due to purine breakdown.
	- **Hyperphosphataemia:** Malignant cells contain up to four times the level of organic and inorganic phosphate.
	- **Hyperkalaemia:** Secondary to cell lysis.
	- **Hypocalcaemia:** Due to hyperphosphataemia and calcium phosphate precipitation in tissues.
- **Pathophysiology:**
	- Uric acid is poorly soluble
		- Under normal physiological conditions, it is 99% ionized and therefore excreted.
		- In TLS, as the uric acid concentration increases, it becomes less ionized
			- crystals begin to precipitate in the renal tubules leading to renal failure.
	- Combination with hyperphosphataemia leads to calcium phosphate precipitation, increasing renal failure risk.
	- Symptoms manifest 48-72 hours post-treatment

| Symptom  | Signs         |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Nausea   | Oedema        |
| Vomiting | Heart failure |
| Lethargy | Arrhythmias   |
|          | Seizures      |
|          | Tetany        |

- **Prophylaxis and Treatment:**
	- Delay chemotherapy until prophylactic measures possible.
	- Avoid trigger factors like tumour surgical manipulation and dexamethasone.
		- Dexamethasone used in the treatment of haematological malignancy
			- induces apoptosis of B cells, ALL cells, and monoclonal lymphoma cells
			- The higher the dose of steroid, the more intense the response.
			- Treatment doses of dexamethasone are in the order of 3 mg/m2 per 12 h, which approximates to a 0.1 mg/kg dose, the same as the antiemetic dose.
	- Mainstay of treatment:
		- aggressive hyperhydration
		- diuresis
		- drugs to control the hyperuricaemia.
	- **Hyperhydration:** 3 litre/m²/day targeting >100 ml/m²/h diuresis.
		- In children who are profoundly hypoalbuminaemic or have poor cardiac function, this volume of fluid may lead to pulmonary oedema.
		- Hyperhydration therapy may need to be initiated and monitored in a high-dependency environment.
	- **Medications:**
		- Aluminium hydroxide for hyperphosphataemia.
		- Allopurinol or rasburicase for hyperuricaemia.
		- Urinary alkalinization with caution.
			- Can lead to calcium phosphate deposition in the presence of hyperphosphataemia and urinary xanthine crystals if there is concomitant treatment with allopurinol.
	- **Severe Cases:** Transfer to PICU for renal replacement therapy.
### Blood Product Administration

#### Doses of Blood Products

![[39068977-B65D-42AC-AD28-C159360444A9.jpeg]]

### Common PICU Problems

#### Resoiratory Failure

- **Causes:**
	- Infection or side effects of treatment.
	- **Cytotoxic agents:** Bleomycin causes lung fibrosis, pneumonitis, and predisposition to oxygen-induced lung injury.
	- **Radiotherapy:** Lung damage related to total radiation dose.
- **Common Issues:**
	- Pleural effusions, pulmonary infiltrates, and infective pneumonitis.
	- Pleural effusions from:
		- inflammation
		- cancer cells
		- lymphatic obstruction due to mediastinal masses.
- **Infections:**
	- Commonly caused by gram-negative bacteria.
	- Risk from parasites, fungi, viruses (e.g., CMV) in immunocompromised children.
	- Risk of pneumonitis from graft vs host disease (GVHD) post-bone marrow transplant or from non-irradiated blood.
- **Diagnosis:**
	- Symptoms and investigations similar to other causes of respiratory failure.
	- Difficult diagnosis, sometimes requiring lung biopsy.
- **Management:**
	- Supportive treatment targeting the underlying cause.
	- **Main treatments:** Broad-spectrum antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, ventilation.
	- Enhanced oxygen toxicity risk due to cytotoxic agent exposure.
	- Careful airway instrumentation due to thrombocytopenia.
	- Increased risk of ventilator-acquired pneumonia.
	- Possible cessation of ongoing chemotherapy during recovery.
#### Cardiovascular Failure

- **Causes:** Tumour compression (particularly in the mediastinum), sepsis, chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., anthracyclines: doxorubicin, daunorubicin).
- The cardiac toxicity of these agents is related to the cumulative dose administered
- **Management:**
	- Monitor with regular echocardiography
	- slower infusion rates
	- liposomal formulations
	- cardioprotective agents
		- dexrazoxane
#### Sepsis
- Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children with haematological malignancy.
- **Risk Factors:** Immunocompromised state due to underlying condition, treatment.
- **Management:**
	- Treatment is with empiric antibiotics while awaiting microbiological analyses.
	- Most hospitals will initiate treatment using a broad-spectrum penicillin and an aminoglycoside with additional cover for gram-positive organisms if the child has an indwelling CVC.
	- If the child presents with septic shock, fluid resuscitation should be guided by cardiac output monitoring
		- many cytotoxic agents cause cardiomyopathy and impaired cardiac function.

![[CE1E0124-D750-43BE-B9FE-8151AFDBD30B.jpeg]]

#### Hyperviscosity

- **Definition:**
	- White cell count >100 x 10⁹/L.
	- Commonly occurs at presentation or relapse.
	- High risk of morbidity and mortality at counts >300 x 10⁹/L.
- **Symptom Development:**
	- Dependent on patient and underlying disease.
	- Acute myeloid leukaemia shows symptoms at lower white cell counts due to larger myeloblast size.
- **Pathophysiology:**
	- Increased blood viscosity.
	- Causes:
		- endothelial damage
		- capillary obstruction
		- micro-infarction
		- organ dysfunction.
	- Organs at risk: brain and lungs.
		- Brain: cerebral haemorrhage or infarction.
		- Lungs: alveoli damage, hypoxia, respiratory failure.
	- Kidneys at risk, similar to Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS).
- **Treatment:**
	- Early initiation of cyto-reductive chemotherapy.
	- Severe cases may require leucopheresis or exchange transfusion.
	- **Pre-treatment measures:**
		- Hyper-hydration.
		- Treatments to reduce TLS risk.
	- Avoid blood transfusion before treatment to prevent increased viscosity.
	- Platelet transfusion may be needed to reduce cerebral haemorrhage risk if count <20 x 10⁹/L.
### Post-Haemopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT)

- **Introduction:**
	- First used successfully in 1968.
	- Treats conditions including acute leukaemias and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).
- **Types:**
	- **Autologous HSCT:** Uses the patient’s own stem cells.
	- **Allogenic HSCT:** Uses donor cells.
- **Mortality and Complications:**
	- High post-HSCT mortality.
	- Main causes: sepsis, pulmonary complications, Graft vs Host Disease (GVHD).
	- Many patients require Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) management.
- **Pulmonary Complications:**
	- Occur in up to 15% of patients.
	- Causes:
		- direct damage and scarring from pre-transplant conditioning
		- endothelial damage from chemotherapy
		- infections.
	- Survival rate for ventilated children with HSCT-related pulmonary complications is <20%.
- **Graft vs Host Disease (GVHD):**
	- Common post-HSCT complication.
	- Significant morbidity and mortality risk.
	- **Forms:**
		- **Acute GVHD:** Occurs within the first 100 days post-transplant, most commonly in the first 5 weeks. Up to 80% incidence in allogenic transplants.
			- arises due to donor cytogenic T-cells recognizing host cells as foreign and rejecting them
		- **Chronic GVHD:** Occurs later, with prolonged effects.
	- **Affected Areas:** Skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver.
	- **Symptoms and Severity:**
		- **Mild:** Maculopapular rash, nausea, diarrhoea, mild liver function derangement.
		- **Severe:** Skin desquamation, ileus, fulminant hepatic failure.
- **Critical Care Treatment:**
	- Supportive care focusing on:
		- Scrupulous skin care.
		- Preventing superimposed infection.
		- Maintaining appropriate fluid balance.
	- **Specific Therapy:**
		- High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone.
		- Additional immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil).
		- Serotherapy (e.g., alemtuzumab).
