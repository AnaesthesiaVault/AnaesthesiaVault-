# Anaesthesia for the Paediatric Cancer Patient
## Introduction
- Childhood cancer is devastating for both the child and their caregivers.
- Anaesthesiologists play a crucial role in alleviating anxiety, pain, and suffering in paediatric cancer patients.
- Children with malignancies face significant physiological and psychological stress from both the disease and its treatment.

**Scope of the Problem:**

- **Worldwide Incidence:** Approximately 150 in 1,000,000 children.
- **South Africa:** 1 in 600 children will have cancer before age 16.
- **United Kingdom:** About 1,500 new paediatric cancer cases annually; cancer accounts for 20% of deaths in children aged 1-14 years.
- **United States:** Incidence increased from 11.5/100,000 in 1975 to 14.8/100,000 in 2004. Five-year survival rates have improved from 58.1% to 79.6%.

**Long-term Considerations:**

- Improved long-term survival means anaesthesiologists will see more survivors needing surgery unrelated to their original cancer.
- Managing these patients requires consideration of the long-term effects of cancer and late side effects of treatment.

**Types of Childhood Cancers:**

- **Leukaemias:** One third of all childhood cancers; acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is most common, peaking at ages 2-3.
- **Lymphomas:** 10-15% incidence, peaking in ages 10-20.
- **Brain and Spinal Cord Tumours:** Account for 25%; common types include astrocytomas, gliomas, and ependymomas.
- **Embryonal Tumours:** 15%, arising from abnormal embryonic tissue proliferation; examples include retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and nephroblastomas (Wilm’s tumour).
- **Rarer Cancers:** Include soft tissue sarcomas, bone tumours, and germ cell tumours.
- **Gender:** Boys are affected 20% more often than girls.

### Overview of the Management of Childhood Cancers
- Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are the principle methods used to treat childhood cancers.
- The anaesthesiologist needs to have a basic understanding of the relevant toxicities of the treatment each patient is receiving.
- The multisystem dysfunction caused by these treatments may have a significant impact on the child’s physiology and thus increase their anaesthetic risk dramatically.
#### Chemotherapy
- Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for the majority of childhood cancers.
- Anaesthesia is often required to administer these treatments:
	- sedation or GA for lumbar punctures with administration of intrathecal chemotherapy
	- facilitating the monitoring of response to treatment with GA and analgesia for painful procedures:
		- bone marrow aspirate
		- trephine biopsies.
- Conventional chemotherapy is designed to be cytotoxic to rapidly dividing cancer cells via a variety of mechanisms.
	- Systemic toxicity is common as normal, healthy cells that also divide rapidly, such as those in the paediatric bone marrow, heart, lungs and airway, are also affected.
	- Every organ system is at risk of being involved
		- thorough history and clinical examination of the patient is needed pre-op to ascertain the extent of organ involvement.
#### Principles of Chemotherapy
- A regimen of multiple drugs from different classes with different mechanisms of action are combined at the maximum dose that can be tolerated by the patient
- Strategies are employed by the oncologist to maximise the anti-cancer effects of the drugs while trying to minimise the systemic toxicity:
	- Using different drugs with non-overlapping toxicity profiles in order to minimise the additive systemic toxicity
	- Alternating chemotherapy drugs at different times in the treatment cycle to provide periodic rest from the toxicities caused by a particular agent
	- Intrathecal administration for primary or preventative treatment of meningeal leukaemias and lymphomas
		- Localised administration of therapy into the CSF is associated with decreased systemic effects but complications of intrathecal administration include:
			- Chemical arachnoiditis
			- Spinal epidural haematoma
			- Postdural puncture headache
	- Use of supplemental drugs or treatments to decrease,remedy or prevent the systemic side effects of the chemotherapeutic agents
		- This allows increased doses to be used and the maximum anti-cancer effect to be achieved
			- Adjunctive treatments include:
				- Anti-emetics
				- Haemopoeitic growth factors
				- Transfusion of blood products
				- Haemopoeitic stem cell transplantation(HSCT)
	- Corticosteroids often used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents because of their cytotoxic, antiemetic and immunosuppressive properties.
		- They bind to the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor and induce apoptosis in the cancer cells.
		- Their immunosuppressive effects are used in combination with HSCT to prevent rejection of the transplanted tissue.
#### Molecularly Targeted Agents
- Targeted strategies are currently being researched:
	- anti-angiogenic therapies
	- immunomodulation
	- gene therapy
	- humanised antibodies.
- These therapies target specific tumour cell receptors and/or signalling pathways needed for tumour cell division and proliferation.
	- Because the tumour cell receptors and proteins are specifically targeted, the effect on healthy tissues is reduced thus limiting toxicity.
- FDA has approved some monoclonal antibodies for clinical use.
	- Target specific tumour cell surface antigenic proteins.
	- These antibodies may be unconjugated, radio-labelled or conjugated with a cytotoxic molecule to increase the damage caused to the cancer cells.
	- They appear to have a relatively little if any systemic toxicity and are being combined with conventional chemotherapy to improve outcomes.
### Radiation Therapy
- Radiation therapy causes death of both cancer cells and healthy tissue by damaging cellular DNA.
- The radio-sensitivity of any cell depends on:
	- Its phase within the cell cycle
	- Its ability to repair damage to DNA
	- Its nutrient and oxygen content
- Normal, healthy cells have a greater ability to repair their DNA following the ionising effects of radiation; however, they require more time to do so.
	- Total dose of radiation required is divided into a series of fractions over days or weeks.
	- The dose of radiation administered and the duration of treatment will depend on the type of tumour being treated.
	- Conformal radiotherapy: three dimensional imaging and computing which allows the radiation dose to conform closely to the tumour shape and size
		- designed to minimise radiation to the surrounding tissues.
	- Even with these new conformal technologies, radiation to healthy tissues is unavoidable and the developing tissues found in children are particularly sensitive to the toxic effects of radiation.
	- The overall damage to normal tissues will depend upon:
		- The total and fractional dose of radiation received
		- The relative sensitivity of the healthy tissue concerned
		- The volume of the tissue irradiated
		- The duration of treatment
		- Use of concurrent chemotherapy
	- Although recent advances in radiation therapy will hopefully limit overall toxicity, many long term survivors who received high dose therapy years before will exhibit late toxic effects:
		- Intracranial
			- Panhypopituitarism
			- Large vessel stroke
			- Ototoxicity
			- Cataracts
		- Chest
			- Coronary artery disease
			- Cardiomyopathy
			- Arrhythmias
			- Pericardial disease
			- Valvular disease
			- Hypo-or hyperthyroidism
			- Thyroid nodules
			- Thyroid cancer
			- Pulmonary fibrosis
			- Restrictive or obstructive lung disease
		- Abdomen/pelvis
			- Intra-abdominal malignancies
			- Bladder Fibrosis
			- Haemorrhagic cystitis
			- Renal insufficiency
			- Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis
### Anaesthetic Considerations

- **Frequent Procedures**: Children with cancer often undergo multiple procedures at different stages, requiring varying levels of anaesthetic care (sedation, general anaesthesia, invasive monitoring).
- **Individualised Approach**: A tailored, systemic approach is crucial to formulate an appropriate anaesthetic plan.

**Key Considerations:**
1. **Direct Tumour Effects**:
	- Assess how the tumour impacts the child's physiology and necessary adjustments.
2. **Chemoand Radiation Therapy Effects**:
	- Evaluate systemic toxicity and its impact on anaesthetic risk.
3. **Coexisting Disease**:
	- Consider other illnesses the child may have.
4. **Surgical Procedure Impact**:
	- Understand the specific requirements and risks associated with the planned surgery.
5. **Drug Interactions**:
	- Be aware of potential interactions between anaesthetic drugs and chemotherapeutic agents.
6. **Aseptic Technique**:
	- Use strict aseptic protocols for immunocompromised patients to prevent infections.
7. **Pain Syndromes**:
	- Address and manage pain effectively, considering both procedural and disease-related pain.
8. **Psychological Stress**:
	- Recognize and mitigate the psychological impact of repeated hospitalisations and procedures.

**Pre-Operative Assessment:**
- Conduct a thorough assessment with a focus on the considerations above.
- Build rapport with the child to help reduce anxiety and stress associated with frequent hospital visits.

**Special Situations:**
- **Anterior Mediastinal Mass**: One of the most challenging scenarios in paediatric anaesthesia. Proper assessment and planning are essential to manage the risks associated with this condition.

**Anterior Mediastinal Mass (AMM) Considerations:**
**Direct Effects of Tumour:**
- Often caused by lymphomas or T-cell ALL.
- Mass may be primary or due to metastases.
- Compression of surrounding structures is the main concern.

**Compression Concerns:**
1. **Tracheobronchial Tree Compression:**
	- Increased risk of airway collapse and obstruction with anaesthesia.
	- Compression may extend below the carina, making tracheal intubation potentially ineffective.
2. **Great Vessels Compression:**
	- **Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome**:
		- Swelling and cyanosis of head, neck, and upper extremities.
		- Raised JVP.
		- Conjunctival oedema.
		- Syncope.
		- Headache.
		- Blurred vision.
		- Lethargy, confusion, or anxiety.
	- **Superior Mediastinal Syndrome (SMS)**:
		- Signs of SVC syndrome plus:
			- Stridor.
			- Dyspnoea.
			- Cough.
			- Wheezing.
			- Dysphagia.
			- Orthopnoea.
			- Hoarseness or change of voice.
			- Observed position of comfort.

**Important Notes:**
- The absence of SMS symptoms does not rule out significant compression by AMM.
- Paediatric patients are less likely to report symptoms due to increased compliance of structures and communication challenges.
- High suspicion is necessary when evaluating children with newly diagnosed lymphoma, neuroblastoma, germ cell tumours, and ALL.

**Strongest risk factors for acute peri-operative cardiac or respiratory complications in patients with an anterior mediastinal mass:**

**Clinical signs and symptoms:**
- Orthopnea
- Upper body edema (signs of SVCS)
- Stridor
- Wheeze

**Diagnostic imaging findings:**
- Tracheal, bronchial, or carinal compression
- Great vessel compression, SVC obstruction
- Pulmonary artery outflow obstruction
- Ventricular dysfunction
- Pericardial effusion

**Anaesthesia in Children with Anterior Mediastinal Mass (AMM):**
- **Diagnostic or Therapeutic Interventions:**
	- General anaesthesia (GA) associated with cardiopulmonary arrest and potentially fatal
	- Incidence of airway and cardiac complications ranges from 9.4%–15%
	- Complications reported in both sedation and GA
- **Predictors of Complications:**
	- Multidisciplinary team decision required to weigh risks vs benefits
	- Consider alternative diagnosis methods (peripheral blood films, pleural fluid aspirates, bone marrow aspirate, and trephine biopsy)
	- Pre-treatment to shrink tumour (irradiation and steroids) is controversial
- **Options for Surgery:**
	- **Local Anaesthetic:**
		- Difficult in younger patients
		- Not suitable for very invasive procedures
	- **General Anaesthesia:**
		- Pre-operative plan required
		- Multidisciplinary team approach
		- Evaluate patient symptoms and radiological investigations to assess anatomy and risk of CVS collapse
- **Pre-operative Evaluation:**
	- **CXR:**
		- Small mass/asymptomatic: CT scan probably not needed
		- Large mass/SVC syndrome/SMS symptoms: CT chest and full investigation required
	- **CT Scan of Chest and Neck:**
		- Delineate anatomy of mass
		- Demonstrate airway and great vessel compression
	- **Flow-volume Loops:**
		- Show trachea, carina, or bronchi compression
		- Difficult in younger children
		- Limited predictive value in adults
	- **ECHO:**
		- Rule out pericardial effusion
		- Show tumour encasement of heart or surrounding structures
		- Demonstrate dynamic compression of heart or great vessels
- **Pre-operative Discussions:**
	- Post-operative ICU admission
	- Plan for CVS collapse intra-operatively
- **Intra-operative Management:**
	- Flexible fibre-optic and rigid bronchoscope with experienced operators available
	- Gentle IV or inhalational induction
	- **Maintain Spontaneous Ventilation Throughout Surgery:**
		- Increase FiO2
		- Reposition to rescue position
		- CPAP
		- IPPV + PEEP
		- Use rigid bronchoscope to stent distal airways if complete obstruction occurs
	- **Great Vessel Compression Management:**
		- Fluid bolus
		- Reposition to rescue position
		- Sternotomy and physical elevation of mass
	- **Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) and ECMO:**
		- Not useful for a child already in CVS collapse due to inevitable global hypoxia by the time bypass techniques are instituted
### Airway and Oral Cavity

**Direct Effects of the Tumour:**
- Tumours directly involving the airway are rare:
	- Usually benign haemangiomas
	- Only 1% malignant, usually lymphomas or soft tissue sarcomas
- Enlarged tonsils and adenoids due to leukaemic infiltration are common:
	- Associated with obstructive sleep apnoea
	- Can lead to pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction
	- Increased sensitivity to narcotic agents
	- Increased risk for post-operative airway obstruction and respiratory arrest
	- Avoid long-acting narcotics
	- Avoid day case surgery
- Leukaemic infiltration of the retropharyngeal lymph nodes may present with stridor
- Direct anatomical compression or deviation of the airway due to tumour's mechanical effects may present potential difficulty in managing the airway

**Side Effects of Treatment:**

- **Oral Mucositis:**
	- Erythematous, painful ulcerative lesions in the oral cavity
	- Common during high-dose chemotherapy, post-HSCT, and radiation therapy to the head and neck
	- Severe cases may limit or interrupt treatment
	- Supra-glottic oedema and bleeding in the oral cavity can lead to potential aspiration of blood and secretions
	- Report of hyperkalaemia with the use of scoline in a patient with severe extensive mucositis due to upregulation of extra-junctional receptors (similar to mechanism seen with burn injuries)
- **Chronic Effects of Irradiation to the Head and Neck:**
	- Fibrosis and stiffening of the soft tissue, leading to limitation of mouth opening and neck extension
	- Airway mucosal fibrosis, chronic subglottic oedema with supraand subglottic narrowing and stenosis
	- Hypoplasia of the jaw and xerostomia
	- All the above may lead to difficulty in managing the patient’s airway
	- In patients who have received radiation therapy to the head and neck region, a thorough and in-depth investigation of their airway is necessary pre-operatively to avoid unanticipated airway problems
### Cardiovascular System

**Direct Effects of Tumour:**
- **Pericardial Effusion:**
	- Common with lymphomas
	- May be small and incidental or large causing tamponade with decompensation
- **Intra-cardiac Tumours:**
	- Uncommon, usually rhabdomyomas or fibromas
	- One-third of patients with primary cardiac tumours may experience hypotension and arrhythmias on induction of anaesthesia

**Side Effects of Treatment:**

- **Chemotherapeutic Agents:**
	- **Anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin):**
		- Most cardiotoxic
		- Used in leukaemias and lymphomas treatment
		- Cardiotoxicity due to free radicals interfering with mitochondrial function and lipid peroxidation in myocytes, and inhibition of topoisomerase II
		- Early (acute) toxicity: occurs within days or weeks, symptoms include hypotension, CCF, arrhythmias, usually reversible
		- Late toxicity: dose-dependent chronic effects, can occur months to years after treatment, progressive and persistent, with subclinical cardiomyopathy incidence as high as 65% in survivors
	- **Other Cardiotoxic Agents:**
		- Alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, mitomycin, ifosfamide, cisplatin)
		- Non-alkylating agents (e.g., fluorouracil, vinca alkaloids like vincristine)
	- Cardiotoxicity manifests as ECG abnormalities, arrhythmias, hypotension, CCF, myocarditis, pericarditis, myocardial ischaemia, chronic cardiomyopathy
	
- **Radiation Therapy:**
	- Affects all heart components: pericardium (pericarditis, pericardial effusions), myocardium (cardiomyopathy), endocardium (endocardial and valvular fibrosis), conducting system (conduction defects), coronary artery disease
	- Higher doses associated with significant acute and long-term disease
	- Combination with anthracycline or vincristine treatment causes additive cardiotoxicity

**Anaesthetic Considerations for Cardiac Toxicity:**
- Subclinical cardiomyopathy may be unmasked during anaesthesia and surgery due to additive cardiodepressant effects of anaesthetic agents
- Reduction in cardiac index during minor procedures may not differ significantly from controls, but clinical significance during major surgery is unknown
- Pre-operative assessment:
	- Baseline ECG for patients receiving or treated with anthracycline agents
	- Recent ECHO required if treated during infancy, high dose (>240mg/m²), chest radiation used, or if above information is unknown
	- Evaluate functional status, type and extent of surgery, and co-existing disease to form an appropriate anaesthetic plan

### Pulmonary System

**Direct Effect of Tumour:**
- **Primary Lung Tumours:**
	- Rare
- **Metastases:**
	- More common, usually from Wilm’s tumour or osteosarcoma
- **Indirect Effects:**
	- Respiratory distress and compromise from:
		- Pleural effusions
		- Chylous effusions from obstructed lymphatics
		- Parenchymal infiltrates
		- Thrombosis
		- Superior mediastinal syndrome (SMS)
		- Hyperleukocytosis-induced pulmonary leukostasis, causing increased blood viscosity in pulmonary vasculature

**Side Effects of Treatment:**
- **Chemotherapeutic Agents Associated with Pulmonary Toxicity:**
	- Bleomycin
	- Busulfan
	- Lomustine
	- Carmustine
	- Cyclophosphamide
	- Methotrexate
	- Mitomycin
	- Vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine)

**Pulmonary Toxicity:**
- **Acute Pulmonary Toxicity:**
	- Manifestations: hypersensitivity pneumonitis, alveolar-interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema
	- Often subclinical despite abnormal pulmonary function tests
	- Non-specific signs of insidious onset
	- Typically resolves after discontinuation of the offending agent
	- Irreversible once radiographic evidence of toxicity is observed
- **Late Pulmonary Toxicity:**
	- Manifests as pulmonary fibrosis
	- Can occur months to years after treatment
	- Generally asymptomatic, but may include exercise-induced dyspnoea, need for supplemental oxygen, chronic cough, bronchitis, recurrent pneumonia
	- Increased incidence with combination chemoand radiation therapy
	- Bleomycin-induced chronic pulmonary toxicity is most common

**Radiation Therapy:**
- Lung tissue is highly sensitive to ionising radiation
- Progression from acute pneumonitis to late pulmonary fibrosis
- Increased and accelerated toxicity with chemotherapy agents (bleomycin, methotrexate, alkylating agents, anti-tumour antibiotics)

**Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation:**
- Pulmonary dysfunction due to cytotoxic agents, chemoand radiation therapy, total body irradiation, chronic graft vs host disease
- Incidence of lung disease: ~24%
- Acute phase: restrictive impairment 3-6 months post-transplant
- Chronic phase: restrictive, obstructive, or isolated diffusion abnormalities

**Anaesthetic Considerations:**
- Concern for progressive pulmonary fibrosis leading to severe restrictive lung disease
- High inspired oxygen concentrations during or post-bleomycin treatment increase pulmonary toxicity and post-operative respiratory distress
	- Use lowest possible peri-operative oxygen concentrations
	- Judicious approach to fluid therapy
- Assess for pulmonary toxicity and occult respiratory compromise
- Pre-operative assessment:
	- Guided by historical/physical findings of insufficiency
	- Lung function tests and CXR during bleomycin treatment and post-stem cell transplantation
	- Assess need for peri-operative ventilation
	- Investigate obstructive lesions (intra-oral, anterior mediastinal masses)
- Survivors of childhood cancer should be questioned about respiratory deficits, symptoms like dyspnoea, cough, wheezing

### Renal System

**Direct Effects of Tumour:**
- Parenchymal renal tumours or non-renal malignancies (e.g., neuroblastomas) infiltrating the kidney causing dysfunction.
- Non-renal tumours (e.g., lymphomas, neuroblastomas, leukaemias) can infiltrate and obstruct the urinary tract and/or renal vasculature.
- Acute renal failure (ARF) may occur due to:
	- Chemotherapy and radiation therapy toxicity.
	- Other nephrotoxic medications.
	- Primary renal tumour.
	- Non-renal tumour infiltration.
	- Urinary tract infiltration and post-renal obstructive uropathy.
	- Tumour lysis syndrome.
	- Severe haemodynamic disturbances (e.g., sepsis, veno-occlusive disease).
- Majority of renal tumours are Wilm’s tumours, presenting with:
	- Asymptomatic abdominal mass (90%).
	- Symptoms like abdominal pain, gross haematuria, hypercalcaemia, hypertension, acquired von Willebrand syndrome (less common).

**Side Effects of Treatment:**

- **Chemotherapeutic Agents:**
	- Almost all agents can cause nephrotoxicity.
	- Agents commonly associated with ARF: cisplatin, carboplatin, ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate.
	- Nephrotoxicity ranges from mild to severe, progressive in up to 30% of patients.
	- Toxicity may be subclinical with moderately reduced glomerular filtration rates (GFR).
	- Increased incidence and severity with concurrent use of other nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., amphotericin B, acyclovir, cyclosporine A, immunoglobulin, antibiotics, diuretics).
	- Cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and ifosfamide can cause SIADH.
	- Cisplatin causes hypomagnesaemia and proximal tubulopathy.
	- Ifosfamide causes protein wasting.
	- Cyclophosphamide’s main urological side effect is haemorrhagic cystitis.
	
- **Radiation Therapy:**
	- Radiation therapy to abdomen or pelvis or total body irradiation (prior to HSCT) unavoidably exposes kidneys.
	- Increased toxicity with combined chemotherapy or post-unilateral nephrectomy for Wilm’s tumour.
	- Radiation nephritis: interstitial nephritis, glomerulosclerosis, azotaemia, proteinuria, anaemia, hypertension.
	- Late effects: hypertension, ongoing renal dysfunction.
	
- **Haemopoetic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT):**
	- Incidence of ARF post-transplant: 20% - 45%.
	- Risk factors: veno-occlusive or graft vs host disease, co-existing disease, pre-conditioning factors (e.g., total body irradiation).
#### Anaesthetic Considerations
- **mpact of Renal Failure:**
	- Affects fluid status, acid-base balance, electrolytes, haemoglobin, coagulation status.
	- Influences pharmacokinetics and dynamics of anaesthetic agents.
- **Renal Protection:**
	- Avoid nephrotoxins.
	- Maintain renal perfusion pressure.
- **Wilm’s Tumour Excision:**
	- Involvement of renal vein or IVC can lead to significant intra-operative blood loss.
	- Requires adequate pre-operative planning.

### Hepatic System

**Direct Effects of Tumour:**

- **Causes of Hepatic Masses:**
	- Primary cancer (most commonly hepatoblastoma).
	- Metastatic lesions.
	- Benign lesions (cysts, inflammatory process).
- **Presentation:**
	- Painless abdominal mass.
	- Hepatic dysfunction and jaundice are uncommon.
	- 20% of hepatoblastoma patients have thrombocytosis.
	- 20% of liver tumour patients may have associated genetic syndromes affecting anaesthesia.

**Side Effects of Treatment:**

- **Chemotherapeutic Agents:**
	- Acute hepatotoxicity and liver function test abnormalities.
	- Rare progression to chronic liver disease.
	- Toxic effects occur hours to weeks after treatment, usually reversible.
	- Common agents: methotrexate, actinomycin D, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine.
- **Radiation Therapy:**
	- Acute radiation-induced hepatotoxicity is dose-dependent and usually self-limiting.
	- Increased incidence and severity with larger liver volume irradiated, concurrent chemotherapy, co-existing disease.
	- Severe toxicity: veno-occlusive disease (VOD), also called sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.
		- Incidence: 11%-27% post-HSCT.
		- Mortality rate: 19%-50%.
		- Extensive damage to liver acinus zone 3 structures.
		- Symptoms: hyperbilirubinaemia, painful hepatomegaly, fluid retention.
		- Complications: portal hypertension, liver failure, multi-organ dysfunction/failure.
		- Risk factors: TBI dose pre-HSCT, chemotherapeutic agents (vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, busulfan).
	- Chronic hepatic fibrosis is uncommon in children but can occur with sufficient radiation doses.

**Anaesthetic Considerations:**
- **Liver Dysfunction:**
	- Impaired drug biotransformation, metabolism, clearance.
	- Decreased protein synthesis, affecting pharmacokinetics and dynamics of anaesthetic agents.
	- Decreased coagulation factor synthesis, leading to impaired haemostasis.
	- Fluid status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte concentrations may be affected.
	- Increased risk of worsening hepatocellular damage during anaesthesia and surgery.
### Gastrointestinal System

**Direct Effects of Tumour:**
- Tumours in the GIT can cause:
	- Intestinal or biliary obstruction
	- Intussusception
	- Erosive perforation
	- Intra-abdominal haemorrhage

**Side Effects of Treatment:**

**Chemotherapeutic Agents:**
- Common GIT toxicities include:
	- Nausea and vomiting

	- Neutropenic enterocolitis
	- Stomatitis
- These effects can lead to:
	- Anorexia
	- Malnutrition
	- Electrolyte imbalances
	- Changes in serum proteins
- Supportive management:
	- Aggressive use of supplemental nutrition
- Pancreatitis may be induced by L-asparaginase

**Radiation Therapy:**
- Chronic GIT effects usually result from radiation therapy or surgery.
- Radiation is toxic to rapidly dividing GIT mucosa cells, causing:
	- Inflammation
	- Oedema
- Mostly transient and self-limiting changes.
- Higher dose therapy can cause chronic effects due to:
	- Destruction of microvasculature
	- Necrosis
	- Fibrosis
	- Ulceration
	- Perforation
	- Adhesions
	- Enteritis
	- Stenosis and obstruction at any point along the GIT

**Anaesthetic Considerations:**
- Delayed gastric emptying must be considered in children currently on or having completed cytotoxic therapy.
- Aspiration risk may be increased by pre-operative use of opiates for pain management.
- Vomiting, mucositis, enteritis, and bowel obstruction may lead to:
	- Malnutrition
	- Dehydration
	- Electrolyte abnormalities
### Nervous System
**Direct Effects of Tumour:**

- **Brain Tumours:**
	- Examples: Astrocytomas, gliomas, ependymomas.
	- Effects depend on location within the CNS and histological type.
	- **Symptoms:**
		- Infants: Irritability, failure to thrive, vomiting, macrocephaly.
		- Older children: Headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, focal neurological deficits.
	- **Acute Neurological Deterioration:**

	- Higher doses can cause focal necrosis, myelitis, stroke, optic toxicity.
	- **Long-term Effects of Cranial Irradiation:**
		- Neurocognitive changes, second malignancies, seizures, coordination, and motor control difficulties.

**Anaesthetic Considerations:**

- **Surgical Resection:**
	- Primary treatment for most paediatric brain tumours.
	- **Symptoms to Manage:**
		- Raised intra-cranial pressure, seizures, altered consciousness.
	- **Pre-operative Assessment:**
		- A thorough understanding of peri-operative risks.
		- Formulation of an appropriate anaesthetic plan for each patient.
### Endocrine and Neuroendocrine Systems

#### Direct Effects of Tumours
- Endocrine tumours represent <5% of childhood cancers.
- Found within an endocrine gland (may or may not secrete hormones) or in non-endocrine tissue (produce ectopic hormones).
- Most common tumours:
	- Gonadal germ cell tumours: 40%-45%
	- Thyroid tumours: 30%
	- Pituitary tumours: 20%
- Can cause localised mass effect (compression of surrounding structures) or present with electrolyte/metabolic disturbances due to excess hormone production.

#### Side Effects of Treatment

**Chemotherapeutic Agents:**
- Glucocorticoids used during cytotoxic therapy for:
	- Treating various toxicities.
	- Inducing direct cytotoxicity via apoptosis.
- Exogenous administration causes hypothalamic-pituitary axis suppression:
	- May lead to insufficient endogenous cortisol during stress (e.g., surgery).
	- Symptoms: hypotension, malaise, anorexia, headache, lethargy, nausea, fever during peri-operative period.
- Long-term effects on the pituitary axis are limited; no association with cytotoxic therapy and hypopituitarism in survivors.

**Radiation Therapy:**

- Pituitary and hypothalamus exposure during treatment of head/neck tumours, total body irradiation for HSCT, prophylactic cranial irradiation of ALL.
- Dose-dependent risk of chronic neuroendocrine dysfunction:
	- Growth hormone deficiency is most common.
	- All cell lines may be affected, leading to various hormone/electrolyte irregularities.
- Irradiation of the neck:
	- Can cause hypo-/hyperthyroidism, thyroid nodules, secondary thyroid cancer.
	- Hypothyroidism is the most common long-term side effect, present in up to 50% of childhood cancer survivors.

#### Anaesthetic Considerations
- > 3 weeks of exogenous steroid therapy of >20mg/day of prednisone or equivalent can cause measurable suppression and inability to mount a stress response for up to 1 year.
	
- May require "stress dose" steroids in the peri-operative setting:
	- Persistent adrenal suppression:
		- 46% of children 2 weeks after stopping prednisone treatment.
		- 13% of children 20 weeks after stopping.
	- Stress response varies; stress dose recommended within 2 months after cessation of glucocorticoid treatment:
		- Hydrocortisone IVI: 1-2mg/kg
		- Dexamethasone IVI: 0.05-0.1mg/kg
- Consult with the treating oncologist before giving steroids in patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS); dexamethasone may trigger TLS episodes peri-operatively.
- Catecholamine-secreting tumours are rare in children; their anaesthetic management is well-documented in literature.
### Haematological System

#### Direct Effects of Tumour
- **Myelosuppression**:
	- Common in childhood cancers.
	- Presents as anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.
	- Caused by bone marrow replacement by cancer cells.
	- Common in newly diagnosed ALL (80%).
	- Thrombocytopenia common during diagnosis in acute leukaemia and bone marrow infiltrating tumours.
- **Leukocyte Count**:
	- Variable in acute leukaemia patients.
	- Neutropenia common in ALL.
	- Hyperleukocytosis predominant in AML.
- **Hyperleukocytosis**:
	- High leukaemic blasts cause intravascular clumping leading to leukostasis.
	- Leukostasis is potentially fatal, causing vessel occlusion, infarction, and haemorrhage in pulmonary and CNS circulations.

#### Side Effects of Treatment
**Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapeutic Agents:**

- Can cause myelosuppression.
- Cytopenia uncommon unless large volumes of bone marrow irradiated.
- Myelosuppression is the most common dose-limiting effect of chemotherapy.
- Reduction in blood cell counts seen 7-10 days after treatment initiation.
- Clinical recovery of acute pancytopenia usually within 4 weeks of treatment cessation.
- Subclinical chronic bone marrow dysfunction may persist, revealed under future stress.
- Myeloablative preparation for HSCT with radiation therapy causes near-complete destruction of host haemopoietic stem cells.
	- Engraftment and haematopoietic recovery occur within the first month post-transplantation.
	- Patient highly susceptible to infections, bleeding, and anaemia during recovery.

**Leukopenia:**
- Most common haematologic toxicity of cytotoxic treatment.
- Often causes cessation or dose limitation of treatment.
- Neutropenia associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
- Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (stimulates growth and maturation of myeloid progenitor cells).

**Anaemia:**
- Very common in children with cancer (82%).
- Results from toxic effects of treatment, poor nutritional status, marrow infiltration, repeated phlebotomy, haemolysis, and inflammatory states.
- Treatment includes red cell transfusion and erythropoietin.

**Thrombocytopenia:**
- Cannot be treated with haematopoietic growth factors.
- Frequent platelet transfusions and therapy interruptions necessary.
- Clinically significant bleeding is the most common cause of early death in children with leukaemia.
- Multifactorial aetiology:
	- Myelosuppressive effects of treatment.
	- Marrow invasion by tumour.
	- Consumptive thrombocytopenia due to infection and DIC.
	- Increased platelet sequestration (splenomegaly).
	- Platelet dysfunction (medication or uraemia).
	- Dilutional thrombocytopenia secondary to transfusion therapy.

#### Anaesthetic Considerations
- **Neutropenia**:
	- Investigate for fever and sepsis.
	- Consider urgency of surgery and clinical status.
	- Follow standard precautions to prevent infection (use gloves, gowns, masks, aseptic technique, avoid PR medication administration, peri-operative protective isolation).
	- Evaluate mucositis if neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm³.
- **Red Blood Cell Transfusion**:
	- Individualised approach based on overall clinical condition, signs/symptoms of anaemia, tolerance to decreased red cell volume and oxygen carrying capacity, presence of cardiopulmonary dysfunction, stress/anticipated blood loss of planned surgery, risk of peri-operative bleeding, patient's ability to tolerate volume load.
	- Use leukodepleted blood to reduce fever and infections.
	- Exercise caution in hyperleukocytosis (leukocrit > 10-15%) to avoid worsening hyperviscosity syndrome.
- **Platelet Transfusion**:
	- Lack of evidence peri-operatively in children with cancer.
	- ASCO guidelines:
		- 40,000-50,000/ml for major invasive procedures.
		- 20,000/ml for minor procedures (e.g., bone marrow biopsies).
		- > 100,000/ml for neurosurgical procedures.
			
		- 10,000/ml for lumbar puncture.
	- Post-transfusion platelet count should be confirmed.
	- Transfusion of 10ml/kg platelets should increase count by 50,000-100,000/ml.
	- Use leukodepleted platelets to minimise alloimmunisation risk for patients likely to receive multiple transfusions.
### Disorders of Haemostasis

#### Direct Effect of Tumour
- **Aetiology of Bleeding**:
	- Thrombocytopenia
	- Hyperleukocytosis in AML
	- Clotting factor deficiency
	- Circulating anticoagulants
	- Defects in vascular integrity
- **Acquired Bleeding Disorders**:
	- Lupus anticoagulant syndrome
	- Acquired von Willebrand syndrome (8% in children with Wilm’s tumour)
	- Inhibitors to factor VIII or acquired haemophilia
	- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
- **Thromboembolism**:
	- Rare in general paediatric population, common in paediatric cancer patients
	- Increased risk due to:
		- Chronic indwelling central venous catheters
		- Chemotherapeutic agents (corticosteroids and L-asparaginase)
		- Infections and sepsis
		- Increasing age of the child

#### Side Effects of Treatment
- **Thrombocytopenia**:
	- Caused by cytotoxic treatment
- **Increased Fibrinolysis and Coagulation Factor Dysfunction**:
	- Due to hepatic dysfunction, vitamin K deficiency, poor nutritional state, recurrent infection, medication effects

#### Anaesthetic Considerations
- **Transfusion of Clotting Factors**:
	- Individualised per patient
	- Based on prolonged markers of coagulation (PT or aPTT) and surgical bleeding despite sufficient platelet levels
	- Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) needs to be ABO compatible and leukodepleted
- **Risk of Thrombosis**:
	- Increased intra-operative risk in cancer patients
	- Risk of thrombosis vs. peri-operative bleeding needs to be discussed with oncologist and haematologist

### Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS)

- **Characteristics**:
	- Rapid, massive destruction of tumour cells
	- Release of cellular components causing ARF, multi-organ dysfunction, and death
	- Common in haematological malignancies with high proliferation rates, large tumour burden, and sensitivity to cytotoxic therapy:
		- ALL
		- Burkitt’s lymphoma
		- AML (may occur spontaneously)
	- Typically occurs post-chemo/radio-therapy, with fever or peri-operatively associated with anaesthesia and surgery

### Retinoic Acid Syndrome

- **Occurrence**:
	- Up to 27% in patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia receiving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
- **Symptoms**:
	- Respiratory distress, fever, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural/pericardial effusions, hypotension, CCF, ARF
	- Potentially fatal

#### Anaesthetic Considerations for TLS
- **Hydration**:
	- Keep high-risk patients well hydrated peri-operatively
- **Prophylaxis**:
	- Discuss fluid administration, rasburicase, and allopurinol with oncologist pre-surgery
- **Dexamethasone**:
	- Consult oncologist before administration due to risk of triggering peri-operative TLS

### Neurocognitive Dysfunction

- **Prevalence**:
	- Common in adults who survived childhood cancer (40% in acute leukaemia survivors)
- **Affected Areas**:
	- Intelligence, executive functioning, psychomotor skills, verbal comprehension, attention, memory
- **Risk Factors**:
	- Direct effect of tumour/surgery to the brain
	- Cranial irradiation
	- Age <5 years
	- Female gender
	- Certain cytotoxic agents (systemic and intrathecal methotrexate)

#### Psychological Changes

- **Acute Considerations**:
	- Fear, grief, anxiety, reliance on medical community, repeated hospital admissions
	- PTSD prevalence of 33-68%
	- Financial and emotional burden on family
	- Operating room anxiety requires special preparation and desensitisation techniques
	- Respect preferred routines to minimise trauma
- **Chronic Considerations**:
	- Increased incidence of chronic health conditions in survivors (62.3%)
	- 27% have severe or life-threatening conditions
	- Psychological issues: depression, anxiety, behavioural problems, PTSD
	- Requires delicate approach considering psychological effects of past ordeal
### Pain and Paediatric Cancer

#### Direct Effect of Tumour
- **Commonality**: Tumour/metastatic disease-related pain is common (78% experience pain pre-diagnosis).
- **Acute Pain Resolution**: Often resolves within 10 days of treatment initiation.
- **Chronic Pain**: Phantom limb and persistent bone pain can be difficult to treat.
- **Pain Sources**: Bone, viscera, or peripheral nerve involvement.
- **Management**: Requires specialist chronic pain physicians; medications with anaesthetic implications.

#### Side Effects of Treatment
- **Prevalence**: Pain is the most common symptom in cancer treatment (84% inpatients).
- **Pain Severity**: 80% report moderate to severe pain.
- **Pain Causes**: Anti-neoplastic therapy (41-58%), surgical procedures, unrelated causes, tumour.

#### Anaesthetic Considerations
- **Role**: Minimize pain and stress during procedures.
- **Techniques**:
	- Mask anaesthesia with VIMA for patients without IV access.
	- TIVA with propofol (± ketamine, opiate) for those with central access.
- **Opioids**: Essential for moderate to severe pain; may lead to tolerance.
- **Analgesic Plan**: Patient-specific, multimodal approach including regional anaesthesia.
- **Regional Technique Risks**:
	- Bleeding/coagulopathy (epidural/spinal haematoma).
	- Peripheral neuropathy from high-dose cisplatin therapy.
- **Pre-operative Discussion**: Necessary for benefits vs risks evaluation.

### Recommended Pre-operative Evaluation

#### Pre-op Testing and Evaluation
- **Routine Testing**: Insufficient data for routine testing; individualized based on history, examination, disease state, and planned surgery.
- **Investigations**:
	- **FBC**: Consider general condition, comorbidities, planned surgery, potential bleeding, hematologic abnormalities.
	- **Coagulation Studies**: Needed if platelet count is sufficient and no abnormal bleeding history; specific conditions may increase risk.
	- **Electrolytes**: Check if imbalance suspected (SIADH, hypercalcaemia, intracranial pathology, dehydration, renal dysfunction, tumour lysis syndrome).
	- **Hepatic/Renal Function**: Review trends in organ function; specific conditions warrant testing.

#### Other Pre-op Considerations
- **Vascular Access**:
	- Plan pre-surgery; central venous access common.
	- Use aseptic technique, aspirate ports before use, consider risks with chronic steroid use.
- **Fasting Guidelines**: Same as healthy children; adjust for cancer-related comorbidities.

### Anaesthesia for Radiation Therapy

#### Indications for Radiation
- Brain tumours: Gliomas, medulloblastomas.
- Tumours outside CNS: Lymphoma, neuroblastoma.
- Leukaemia: Cranial irradiation in ALL.

#### Importance of Patient Movement Control
- High-dose radiation aims to target tumour cells while sparing healthy tissue.
- Control of patient movement is crucial.

#### Anaesthesia Requirements
- **Younger Children**: General anaesthesia required.
- **Older Children (>5 years)**: May tolerate without anaesthesia with suitable preparation.
- **Radiation Dose**: Divided into fractions over 10 days to several weeks.

#### Anaesthetic Goals
- Rapid onset, brief duration, and prompt recovery.
- Ensure immobilization during treatment.
- Maintain patent airway in various positions.

#### Anaesthetic Agents
- **Propofol TIVA**: Preferred for rapid onset, quick recovery, low side effects, anti-emetic properties.
- **Avoid Opiates**: Not indicated as there is no pain; opiates cause respiratory depression.

#### Vascular Access
- Long-term access established with indwelling central venous catheter.

#### Thermoplastic Mould for Head/Neck Radiation
- **Purpose**: Prevent movement.
- **Process**:
	- Patient sedated/asleep; warm mould draped over head.
	- Mould hardens around contours.
	- Pre-made holes for nostrils and mouth.
	- Ensure airway remains patent.
	- Oropharyngeal airway or LMA inserted to act as a spacer.
#### Prone Position
- Mostly obsolete due to conformal radiotherapy advances.
- Propofol TIVA with spontaneous ventilation works well.

#### Remote Location Considerations
- Radiotherapy suite is remote, requiring specific precautions:
	- **Pipeline Gases/Vacuum**: Not readily available; use electric suction and backup oxygen.
	- **Resuscitation Equipment/Emergency Drugs**: Must be immediately available.
	- **Staff Familiarity**: Staff may not be familiar with anaesthetic equipment/techniques.
	- **Remote Monitoring**: Use TV cameras/screens to monitor patient and equipment.

#### Post-Procedure Recovery
- Transfer to recovery area within the radiotherapy suite.
- Ensure patient fully regains consciousness before discharge.
- Rapid recovery with propofol TIVA; patients can return to ward shortly after.
- Discharge criteria: Patients can be discharged as soon as 30 minutes post-procedure.
