# Managing the Difficult Airway in the Syndromic Child

## Managing the Difficult Airway in the Syndromic Child

1. **ASA Definition of a Difficult Airway:**
	- A clinical situation where a conventionally trained anaesthesiologist experiences difficulty with facemask ventilation, tracheal intubation, or both.
2. **Incidence of Difficult Laryngoscopy in Pediatrics:**
	- Retrospective review of 11,219 pediatric procedures showed an estimated incidence of 1.35%.
	- Higher risk in:
		- neonates
		- infants
		- underweight children
		- ASA physical status III/IV
		- Mallampati score III/IV.
	- Reliability of the Mallampati score in predicting difficult airway in children is questioned.
	- Colorado Pediatric Airway Score (COPUR) may be more reliable due to its detailed scoring system.

1. **Challenges in Pediatric Airway Assessment:**
	- Cooperation during airway assessment can be challenging in children.
	- A comprehensive scoring system that accounts for different airway aspects is preferable.
2. **Incidence and Predictors of Difficult Airway Management in Children:**
	- Data on difficult airway management in children is sparse but lower than in adults.
	- Syndromic children often exhibit predictors of difficult intubation:
		- Dysmorphic features.
		- Limited neck extension (e.g., Klippel–Feil syndrome).
		- Limited mouth opening or restricted temporomandibular joint mobility.
		- Macroglossia (e.g., Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome).
		- Limited submandibular space (e.g., retrognathia, micrognathia, Pierre Robin syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome).
		- Structural abnormalities of the laryngo-tracheal passage.
		- Presence of soft tissue tumors, storage diseases (e.g., mucopolysaccharidoses), and arteriovenous/lymphatic malformations.
	- Neonates and infants may require lateral profile assessment to detect subtle signs of mandibular hypoplasia.

1. **Common Syndromes Associated with Difficult Airway Management:**
	- The article discusses several common syndromes encountered in pediatric anesthesia practice that are linked to difficult airway management.
2. **Importance of Familiarity with Techniques and Devices:**
	- Numerous techniques and devices are available to manage difficult airways.
	- Experience and familiarity with equipment are more crucial than the specific device chosen.
3. **Preoperative Assessment for Syndromic Children:**
	- Focus on signs/symptoms of airway obstruction (e.g., apnoea, somnolence, noisy breathing, stridor, snoring).
	- Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is common due to anatomical changes.
	- Include review of dentition, mouth opening, head-neck mobility, facial anomalies, anomalies of the palate and mandibular floor, and thyromental distance in the examination.
	- Consider non-airway-related clinical problems (e.g., congenital cardiac lesions, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, seizure disorders, raised intracranial pressure, developmental delay).
4. **Anaesthetic Planning:**
	- Discussion with the child (if appropriate) and parents/caregivers before induction of anesthesia.
	- Consider the potential need for a surgical airway, especially in urgent surgeries.
	- Establish a 'bail out' plan in case of failure to secure a non-surgical airway, involving relevant specialities (refer to the Difficult Airway Society Guidelines).
	- Adequate time should be allocated to premedication, choice of anesthetic technique, equipment setup, and considerations before induction.
5. **Use of Neuromuscular Blockers:**
	- Despite discussions advocating for the use of neuromuscular blockers without prior verification of facemask ventilation in normal airways, confirming facemask ventilation before paralysis is recommended in syndromic patients.
	- Neuromuscular blockade improves intubating conditions and facilitates mask ventilation once satisfactory ventilation is confirmed.

### **Trisomy 21 (T21)**

- **Prevalence**: Most common chromosomal abnormality, occurring in 1:600–800 live births.
- **Airway Management Issues**:
	- Short neck, relative macroglossia, microdontia, mid-facial and mandibular hypoplasia.
	- Atlanto-axial instability due to vertebral ligamentous abnormalities.
	- Higher incidence of congenital subglottic and/or tracheal stenosis.
	- Tonsillar and adenoidal hypertrophy contributes to upper airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.
	- **Mask Ventilation**: May be difficult; use of oral and/or nasal airway is helpful.
	- **Laryngoscopy**: Generally straightforward; mouth opening is normal, and the large tongue is soft, easily displaced by the laryngoscope blade.
	- **Post-extubation Stridor**: Occurs in one-third of patients, especially in younger, small-for-age patients.
	- **Congenital Subglottic Stenosis**: Estimated in <1% of T21 children; may be underestimated due to lack of screening.
	- **Tracheal Tubes**: Use 0.5–1 mm smaller than calculated size to avoid subglottic trauma.
	- **Atlanto-axial Instability**:
		- Caused by laxity of the transverse ligament and/or odontoid process malformation.
		- Symptoms:
			- Motor abnormalities
			- gait changes
			- weakness
			- spasticity
			- hyperreflexia
			- bladder/bowel function changes
			- neck pain
			- head tilt/torticollis.
		- **Radiological Evaluation**: Accurate after 3 years of age; asymptomatic patients with atlanto-dens interval <4.5 mm and neural canal width >14 mm can proceed with surgery.
		- **Symptomatic or Abnormal Findings**: Full cervical spine precautions required, with referral to neurosurgery if necessary.
		- **Positioning Precautions**: Neck flexion-extension and rotation movements should be minimized; use of soft cervical collar recommended to maintain neutral position during surgery.

### **Beckwith–Wiedemann Syndrome**

- **Prevalence**: Occurs in approximately 1:14,000 live births, equally distributed between sexes.
- **Airway Management Issues**:
	- **Maxillary Hypoplasia and Macroglossia**: Can result in upper airway obstruction and difficult direct laryngoscopy.
	- **Obstructive Sleep Apnoea**: May lead to alveolar hypoventilation, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale.
	- **Visceromegaly**: Enlargement of liver, spleen, kidneys, or presence of intra-abdominal tumors can shift the diaphragm upwards, reducing functional residual capacity and increasing risk of endobronchial intubation.
	- **Risk During Induction/Emergence**: Increased likelihood of upper airway obstruction; positioning (prone or lateral) may help relieve obstruction.
	- **Intubation Assistance**: Pulling the tongue out with forceps can improve the laryngoscopy view.
	- **Tracheal Diameter**: Tends to be larger than that of similarly aged children; cuffed tracheal tubes are recommended to avoid the need for exchanging tubes.
	- **Intubation Devices**: Successful intubation reported with GlideScope; fibreoptic bronchoscopy should be available as a backup.
### **Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS)**

- **Prevalence**: Occurs in 1:8500 live births with equal male-to-female ratio.
- **Clinical Triad**:
	- micrognathia
	- glossoptosis
	- Uor V-shaped cleft palate.
- **Etiology**: Considered a sequence due to secondary abnormalities caused by a single anomaly.
- **Associated Syndromes**: Includes Stickler syndrome, Catel–Manzke syndrome, Toriello–Carey syndrome, and Franceschetti syndrome.
- **Airway Management Issues**:
	- **Mandibular Hypoplasia**: Causes retrognathia and glossoptosis, leading to airway obstruction of varying severity.
	- Some patients may require surgical interventions (e.g., tracheostomy, mandibular distraction, glossopexy) for severe respiratory and feeding problems.
	- Non-surgical airway management techniques, including prone positioning, nasopharyngeal airway insertion, LMA use, or tracheal intubation, successfully manage two-thirds of PRS patients.
- **Types of Upper Airway Obstruction** (Based on Mandibular Hypoplasia):
	- **Type 1**: Glossoptosis with tongue touching posterior pharynx below the soft palate.
	- **Type 2**: Tongue touches at or above the soft palate, compressing it against the posterior pharyngeal wall.
	- **Type 3**: Medial compression by lateral pharyngeal walls.
	- **Type 4**: Sphincteric pharyngeal constriction.
- **Surgical Interventions**:
	- Type 1 and 2 obstructions: Managed with nasopharyngeal airway or mandibular distraction; some type 2 may require tracheostomy.
	- Type 3 and 4 obstructions: Generally require tracheostomy for airway relief.
- **Laryngoscopy and Intubation**: Very difficult in neonates and infants but tends to improve with age and mandibular growth. Fibreoptic intubation is the gold standard in elective settings, though video laryngoscopes and fibreoptic intubation via LMA have also been used successfully.

### **Treacher Collins Syndrome**

- **Prevalence**: Occurs in 1:10,000 live births, with 60% of cases resulting from new mutations.
- **Etiology**: Genetic mutation on chromosome 5 affects the first and second branchial arches, involving neural crest formation.
- **Airway Management Issues**:
	- **Craniofacial Findings**: Maxillary, mandibular, and zygomatic hypoplasia; high arched palate or cleft palate; small oral aperture; temporomandibular joint abnormalities.
	- Unlike PRS, airway management and intubation become more difficult with age due to decreased mandibular growth.
	- **Failed Intubations**: Retrospective review showed a 5% failed intubation rate; 53% of patients had Cormack and Lehane grade 3 and 4 views during direct laryngoscopy.
	- **Face Mask Ventilation**: Difficult in some patients but becomes easy after LMA insertion. No cases of 'can’t intubate, can’t ventilate' scenarios, emergency cricothyroidotomy, or tracheostomy were reported.
	- **Intubation Techniques**: Various methods have been successful, including blind nasal intubation, fibreoptic intubation via LMA, fibreoptic-assisted laryngoscopy, and video laryngoscopy (e.g., GlideScope, Airtraq).

### **Goldenhar Syndrome**

- **Etiology**: Also known as oculo-auriculo-vertebral syndrome or facio-auriculo-vertebral sequence; involves hemifacial microsomia, affecting the first and second branchial arches. Multifactorial causes, with rare familial cases.
- **Airway Management Issues**:
	- **Facial Asymmetry**: Causes difficulties in maintaining a seal for facemask ventilation. Using gauzes and self-adhesive tape can improve the mask seal.
	- **Difficult Intubation**: Results from asymmetrical mandibular hypoplasia, hemifacial microsomia, tracheal deviation, and craniovertebral abnormalities (e.g., C1–2 subluxation, limited neck mobility).
	- **Radiological Evaluation**: Three-dimensional CT scanning is recommended for selected patients with craniofacial-vertebral abnormalities.
	- **Intubation Techniques**: Successful techniques include fibreoptic intubation via LMA, lightwand, suspension laryngoscopy, and video laryngoscopy.

### **Apert Syndrome (Acrocephalosyndactyly)**

- **Prevalence**: Occurs in 1:100,000 live births; autosomal-dominant disorder caused by a single-gene defect on chromosome 10.
- **Anatomy and Symptoms**:
	- Affects the first branchial arch, resulting in malformations of the skull, face, hands, and feet.
	- Premature fusion of coronal and cranial base sutures causes hypertelorism and mid-face hypoplasia.
	- Narrow nasopharyngeal passages, choanal stenosis, high arched palate with excessive soft tissue, leading to airway obstruction.
	- Fused cervical vertebrae (found in two-thirds of patients, mainly at C5-6, less commonly at C3-4) can limit neck mobility, complicating intubation.
	- Obstructive sleep apnoea may occur, aggravated by tracheal narrowing from fused tracheal rings (bamboo trachea), requiring a smaller tracheal tube.
	- Tracheal stiffening reduces clearance of secretions, potentially causing ‘monophonic’ wheezing sounds.
- **Respiratory Complications**:
	- 10% incidence of respiratory complications during anesthesia, managed with bronchodilators or increasing depth of anesthesia.
	- Higher risk of complications with upper respiratory tract infections, making it prudent to postpone elective procedures.
- **Laryngoscopy**: Difficult after mid-face advancement surgery, with limited mouth opening due to fibrosis or mechanical impingement of the temporalis muscle.

### **Klippel–Feil Syndrome**

- **Prevalence**: Occurs in 1:40,000 live births; most cases are sporadic.
- **Clinical Features**:
	- Classic triad: Short neck, low posterior hairline, and limited neck mobility due to absence or fusion of cervical vertebrae.
	- May also present with abnormalities at the atlanto-occipital joint and spinal canal stenosis.
	- Sprengel's deformity (elevated shoulder) in 25-35% of patients, causing decreased ventilatory capacity and difficulties with surgical positioning.
- **Airway Management Issues**:
	- Cervical (and thoracic) spine anomalies limit neck motion, complicating airway management, especially with associated micrognathia and mandibular anomalies.
	- Risk of spinal cord injury during laryngoscopy, intubation, and patient positioning.
	- Sudden rotatory head movements can cause syncope due to compromised blood supply from vascular anomalies.
	- **Techniques**: Lightwand, LMA, and fibreoptic-assisted intubation have been successful.
	- Degree of difficulty with airway management increases with age.

### **Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS)**

- **Overview**: A group of lysosomal storage disorders resulting from the absence or malfunction of lysosomal enzymes required for glycosaminoglycan breakdown.
- **Types**: Includes Hurler syndrome (Type I), Morquio syndrome (Type IV), and Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome (Type VI).
- **Airway Management Issues**:
	- Coarse facial features (gargoylism) with difficult facemask fit, macroglossia, thickened mucosa, hypertrophy of adenoids and tonsils, hypoplastic mandible, reduced temporomandibular joint mobility, narrowed trachea, short and immobile neck.
	- Potential odontoid hypoplasia and atlanto-axial subluxation may cause spinal cord compression.
	- Cardiac dysfunction common, leading to early death from cardiomyopathy or coronary heart disease in untreated patients.
- **Airway Management Statistics**:
	- 14% incidence of difficult facemask ventilation and 25% incidence of difficult intubation in a retrospective chart review of 214 procedures in 17 patients.
	- Intubation failed in two cases.
	- **LMA**: Useful for ventilation on induction and to facilitate fibreoptic intubation.
- **Treatment Impact**:
	- Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCST) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) have alleviated airway obstruction and pulmonary complications.
	- HCST associated with lower incidence of airway problems compared to ERT.

# The Difficult Paediatric Airway

### **Introduction**
- Managing a child with acute respiratory distress is one of the most frightening and difficult areas of anesthesia management.
- Anatomical differences between infants, children, and adults, combined with the child’s inability to cooperate, complicate airway management.
- Understanding normal airway anatomy and physiology is essential for better management of difficult pediatric airways.
### **Anatomical Structures: Differences in the Infant Airway**

1. **Higher Larynx Location**:
	- The infant larynx is higher in the neck compared to older children and adults.
	- Premature infant: Larynx at the mid-third cervical vertebra (C3).
	- Term infant: Larynx between C3 and C4.
	- Teenager/Adult: Larynx between C4 and C5.
	- The higher larynx location affects the angle for laryngoscope insertion, contributing to the preference for straight blades in infant laryngoscopy.
2. **Relatively Large Tongue**:
	- The infant’s tongue is relatively larger, increasing the risk of upper airway obstruction.
	- The smaller distance between the tongue and the hard palate makes airway obstruction more likely.
	- Controlling the infant's tongue with a laryngoscope blade is more difficult.
3. **Epiglottis Characteristics**:
	- Infant's epiglottis: Short, stubby, and angled away from the tracheal axis.
	- Adult's epiglottis: Broad, floppy, and parallel to the tracheal axis.
	- The infant's epiglottis may be challenging to control during laryngoscopy.
4. **Vocal Cord Attachment**:
	- In infants, the vocal cords attach lower anteriorly than posteriorly.
	- In adults, the vocal cords are perpendicular to the tracheal axis.
	- Blindly passed nasotracheal tubes often get caught in the anterior commissure in infants.
5. **Narrowest Portion of the Airway**:
	- **Adults**:
		- The narrowest portion is at the level of the cricoid cartilage, similar to pediatric patients.
		- In adults, the airway narrowing is usually not significant enough to impede passage of an endotracheal tube.
		- Adult airway diameters: 10-16 mm in females, 13-19 mm in males.
		- The apparent subglottic narrowing in adults may only be problematic when passing larger tubes (e.g., double lumen tubes).
	- **Infants/Young Pediatric Patients**:
		- The cricoid cartilage is also the narrowest portion of the airway, but the narrowing is more pronounced due to the incomplete development of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages.
		- An endotracheal tube may pass the vocal cords easily but become "tight" in the subglottic region.
		- The pediatric larynx is described as "funnel-shaped" compared to the "nearly cylindrical" adult larynx.
## Physiology
- **Obligate nose breathing:** Infants are obligate nose breathers due to their inability to coordinate laryngeal structures with respiratory effort.
	- Upper airway obstruction, such as choanal atresia, can be severe.
- **Coordination development:** Most infants achieve coordination of respiration and laryngeal function by 3-5 months of age.
- **Immature airway structures:** Infants and young children have immature laryngeal, tracheal, and bronchial structures that are highly elastic, making them vulnerable to mechanical compression, stretching, and distortion by internal or external pressures.
- **Airway obstruction risks:** Care must be taken when holding a mask on a child's face, as improper finger placement can cause near-total airway obstruction by compressing the larynx.
- **Atlanto-occipital junction extension:** Excessive extension of the head at the atlanto-occipital junction was previously thought to cause airway obstruction by stretching the trachea.
	- video studies did not confirm this.
- **Dynamic airway collapse:** The trachea is prone to dynamic airway collapse, especially at the thoracic inlet, due to the pressure differential between atmospheric pressure and intratracheal pressure.
![[B7C126B4-6DA6-4A11-8749-E2BE2133BB3A 2.jpeg]]
	- **Figure 3a:** Illustrates normal dynamic tracheal collapse at the thoracic inlet during inspiration and normal tracheal and bronchial dilatation during expiration.
	- **Figure 3c:** Shows exaggerated dynamic tracheal collapse with upper airway obstruction. Agitation and deep breathing against this obstruction worsen the collapse.
	- **Minimizing dynamic collapse:** This can be mitigated by avoiding procedures that upset the child and, if necessary, applying positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) while allowing spontaneous breathing.
	- **Figure 3d:** Depicts lower airway obstruction (e.g., asthma or intrathoracic foreign body). PEEP helps reduce the pressure differential and prevent exaggerated dynamic tracheal collapse.
![[06936DD2-B5E7-4328-A970-062229392EA1.jpeg]]

- **PEEP application:** Providing 5-10 cmH2O PEEP can reverse dynamic tracheal collapse and improve oxygenation. This also offsets intrathoracic airway collapse during obstructed expiration, which is worsened in agitated children.
- **Stridor and wheezing:** Functional anatomical changes explain inspiratory stridor in upper airway obstruction and expiratory stridor and wheezing in lower airway obstruction. Symptoms worsen when the child is upset.
- **Higher oxygen consumption:** Infants and small children have a higher oxygen consumption compared to adults. Under anesthesia, the compliant chest and the effects of potent anesthetics reduce functional residual capacity, leading to rapid desaturation.
- **Respiratory muscle composition:** Infants younger than two years have fewer type I muscle fibers in their diaphragm and intercostal muscles, leading to fatigue during repetitive motion. Neonates have even fewer type I fibers. This results in frequent apnea with increased respiratory workload.
- **Reduced respiratory reserve:** Infants and young children have a reduced respiratory reserve, leading to rapid fatigue, CO2 retention, and eventual respiratory failure.
- **Airway edema effects:** Airway edema significantly increases the work of breathing, especially in agitated children. This is due to the fact that in children up to five years old, the mucosal lining comprises a larger proportion of the airway diameter, making them more susceptible to airway edema from infection or trauma (e.g., intubation).
- **Airflow resistance:** Resistance to airflow is inversely proportional to the airway radius to the fourth power in laminar flow and to the fifth power in turbulent flow.

### Positioning
- **Importance of Proper Positioning**: Critical for successful laryngoscopy and intubation.
- **Required Manoeuvres**:
	- **Anterior Displacement of the Cervical Spine**:
		- Achieved by placing a folded towel or blanket under the head.
	- **Extension at the Atlanto-Occipital Junction**:
		- Pulling up on the chin (also known as the "sniffing position").
- **Special Consideration for Children Under Five**:
	- **Not Necessary for Anterior Displacement**:
		- Due to the proportionally larger head size in younger children.
		- Natural anterior displacement occurs when the child is flat on the operating table.
- **Positioning Goal**:
	- **Alignment of Oral, Pharyngeal, and Tracheal Axes**:
		- Facilitates easy access to the trachea in patients with normal anatomy.
	- **Applicability**:
		- Same position should be used in most patients with abnormal anatomy.
### Patient Evaluation for Difficult Airway in Children
- **Initial Steps**:
	- **Gathering Information**:
		- History and physical examination are crucial.
		- Review previous anaesthetic records for successful and unsuccessful management techniques.
- **Physical Examination**:
	- **Calm Environment**:
		- Preferably conducted with the child in the presence of parents to ensure a nonagitated state.
	- **Initial Observations**:
		- Assess for normal facies, presence of tracheostomy or scar.
		- Determine if the child will require oxygen.
		- Look for signs of stridor, cyanosis, clubbing, rapid breathing.
		- Observe breathing mode (nose or mouth).
		- Note presence of coughing.
		- Evaluate child’s interaction with parents and the anaesthesiologist.
- **Focus on Syndromic Features**:
	- **Abnormal Facies**:
		- Consider if part of a syndrome (e.g., congenital heart disease, midfacial hypoplasia syndromes).
		- External ear deformity may indicate associated renal and cardiac abnormalities.
- **Physical Examination Details**:
	- **Opportunity-based Examination**:
		- When the child is quiet: listen to the heart and lungs, palpate the abdomen for liver and spleen.
		- When the child cries: assess mouth opening, palate configuration, tongue and tonsil size.
	- **Assessment of Mandibular and Thyroid Cartilage Distance**:
		- Short distance may indicate an “anterior” larynx, suggesting a difficult laryngoscopy.
		- **"Anterior Larynx"**: Malformation leading to posterior displacement of the tongue base, not true anterior displacement of the larynx.
- **Laboratory and Radiological Examination**:
	- **Not Solely Focused on Airway**:
		- Evaluate other systems that might require attention before anesthesia.
	- **Radiological Studies**:
		- Obtain when appropriate.
- **Syndrome-Specific Considerations**:
	- **Awareness of Syndromes**:
		- Anaesthesiologist must be familiar with any syndrome the child has before induction.
	- **Cervical Spine Abnormalities**:
		- Syndromes like Goldenhar’s syndrome may involve cervical spine fusion, complicating laryngoscopy.
		- Conditions like Down syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis may involve an unstable cervical spine, requiring minimal flexion or extension.
### Equipment for Airway Management
- **Importance of Appropriate Equipment**:
	- Ageand size-appropriate airway management adjuncts are crucial.
	- Equipment should be centrally located, such as on a cart for difficult airways.
	- The cart should be mobilized for elective or emergent use.
- **Suggested Contents of the Airway Cart**:
	- A variety of airway adjuncts, with the selection based on the practitioner’s experience.
	- Minimal contents to focus on familiar, effective tools for airway management.
- **Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA)**:
	- Most important rescue device for clearing obstructed airways.
	- Also used as a conduit for fibre-optic intubation, delivering adequate anaesthesia, and maintaining oxygenation.
- **Endotracheal Tube Selection**:
	- Selection of appropriate tube sizes and educated estimation of insertion distance are essential before beginning airway management.

	- **Formula**: Age (years) + 12 / 2
### Planning the Anaesthetic
- **Formulating an Anaesthetic Plan**:
	- Based on evaluation of the child, previous anaesthetic records, medical history, lab and radiological data, and surgical needs.
	- Strategy should be well-considered, with flexibility to adapt as needed.
	- Consultation with colleagues (e.g., ear, nose, and throat surgeon, another anesthesiologist) is important for extra support in emergencies.
- **Rapid Plan Adaptation**:
	- Ability to quickly alter the anaesthetic plan in response to adverse psychological or physiological reactions from the patient.
- **Pre-Operating Room Decisions**:
	- Appropriate size endotracheal tube, insertion distance, and oral airway size should be decided beforehand.
	- Resurgence in the use of cuffed endotracheal tubes in children.
		- Ensure a leak around the cuff when deflated and maintain a controlled leak when inflated (20-30 cmH2O).
		- New, thin-walled, low-pressure cuffed tubes offer potential advantages but are more costly.
- **Premedication Considerations**:
	- Decision on whether to administer premedication, based on airway problem, patient age, cooperation, and surgical procedure.
	- Most patients with compromised airways are not candidates for premedication, except possibly for anxiolytics.
	- Patients undergoing elective surgery without airway obstruction may benefit from premedication, especially for establishing IV access before induction.
- **Inclusion of New Airway Devices in Algorithms**:
	- Pediatric modification of the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ difficult airway algorithm should consider new devices like ProSeal™ LMA, FastTrack™ LMA, and Air Q.
	- These devices allow ventilation at higher peak inflation pressures or enable successful intubation using a blind technique.![[C22EC515-6263-4FF7-88D2-4A03643BF14E.jpeg]]
### Anatomical Problems
- **Understanding Airway Anatomy**: Essential for managing abnormal airway anatomy, particularly in infants or patients with a large tongue, who are prone to upper airway obstruction when unconscious.
	
- **Spontaneous Ventilation**: Often maintained to avoid complications from muscle relaxants, which could make intubation or ventilation difficult.
	
- **Laryngoscopy Technique**: Insert the laryngoscope blade centrally, identify the epiglottis, then move the blade to the right while keeping the tip in the vallecula to sweep the tongue left. This minimizes trauma, especially in difficult airway cases.
	
- **Stylet Use in Difficult Airway Cases**: For conditions like midfacial hypoplasia or certain syndromes (Goldenhar’s, Treacher Collins, Pierre Robin), a stylet can assist in intubation by guiding the tube just behind the epiglottis, using breath sounds to locate the laryngeal inlet.
	
- **Cervical Vertebral Abnormalities**: The same stylet technique can be applied in cases of abnormal cervical vertebrae, allowing the endotracheal tube to bend around the base of the tongue.
	
- **Anaesthesia Induction**: Smooth mask induction is crucial in patients with abnormal airways. Sevoflurane or halothane are preferred, with halothane being particularly effective in reducing laryngospasm.
	
- **Halothane vs. Sevoflurane**: Halothane is favored for children with airway obstruction or those requiring prolonged laryngoscopy due to its higher MAC multiples and superior effect on reducing laryngospasm.
	
- **Alternative Anaesthesia**: If maintaining depth with sevoflurane is challenging, a propofol infusion may be used.
	
- **Retromolar/Lateral Laryngoscopy**: This approach can help visualize the laryngeal inlet in some children, with external larynx pressure aiding visualization.
	
- **Modified Laryngoscope (Oxyscope™)**: Delivers oxygen and anaesthetic agent at the blade tip during laryngoscopy, improving oxygenation compared to standard techniques.

![[477AD8A8-BC85-4195-A6BC-B88286F7231C.jpeg]]

- **Fibre-Optic Laryngoscopy**:
	- Important to gain experience with fibre-optic techniques on normal patients due to the necessity of anatomical knowledge for success.
	- Not recommended to develop this skill during the management of difficult airways.
	- Commonly used with LMA as a temporizing measure and conduit for fibre-optic intubation in difficult pediatric airways.
	- Frei endoscopy mask allows for continued oxygen and inhalation agent administration during fibre-optic intubation
- **Optical Stylets**:
	- Shikani (Clarus Medical, USA) and Storz (Karl Storz, Germany) are examples of optical stylets with fibre-optic illumination and vision connected to an eyepiece or video monitor.
	- Shikani is slightly malleable, suitable for a 3-mm ID endotracheal tube (ETT), tight for a 2.5-mm ID ETT.
	- Storz is not malleable but fits a 2.5-mm ID tracheal tube, with brighter light quality in battery mode.
	- Both devices allow oxygen delivery through the tube's tip, with different adaptor mechanisms.
- **Laryngeal Tube (VBM Medizintechnik, Germany)**:
	- Single-lumen tube with distal and proximal cuffs for sealing the oesophageal inlet and upper pharynx.
	- Available in four types and six sizes, including those designed for children.
	- Color-coded syringes ensure proper cuff inflation.
- **Cobra-PLATM (Perilaryngeal Airway)**:
	- Disposable supraglottic device similar to LMA but seals higher in the hypopharynx with a cylindrical inflatable cuff.
	- Distal end sits over the larynx with a slit for fibre-optic scope and ETT passage.
- **Cricothyroid Puncture**:
	- Guide wire advanced retrograde into the larynx for ETT guidance; however, this method risks tracheal damage or bleeding.
	- Elective tracheostomies may be difficult.
![[AD74424B-02F8-4782-A72D-FEB762538B03.jpeg]]

- **Surgical Airway**:
	- Necessary if intubation and ventilation are not possible.
	- Cricothyrotomy with IV catheter or similar system recommended if a surgeon is unavailable.
	- Simple oxygen delivery can sustain life if the patient is breathing spontaneously, with hypercarbia being well-tolerated.
- **Percutaneous Cricothyroidotomy**:
	- Patient's head extended in midline with rolled towel or sheet under shoulders.
	- Trachea stabilized with right hand, cricothyroid membrane located and marked with left index finger.
	- Large IV catheter (12 to 14 gauge) inserted into cricothyroid membrane, air aspirated, and catheter advanced.
	- Ventilation achieved by attaching to a breathing circuit with a standard 22-mm connector.

![[DC25FCAE-1034-4365-8D9E-D327A707D02A.jpeg]]

- **Ventilation-Catheter (VBM, Germany)**:
	- Designed for jet ventilation, available in 16 gauge (infant), 14 gauge (child), and 13 gauge (adult) sizes.
	- Curved puncture needle within a kink-resistant Teflon® cannula, with two lateral eyes at the distal end.
	- Combined Luer lock and 15-mm adaptor at the proximal end for jet or standard ventilation.
	- Includes fixation flange and foam neck tape for airway security.

# An Institutional Approach to the Management of the ‘Can’t Intubate, Can’t Oxygenate’ Emergency in Children

## Introduction

- **CICO Emergency Overview**: The 'Can't Intubate, Can't Oxygenate' (CICO) emergency is rare in general anesthesia and even less common in pediatric cases, but has poor survival outcomes when it occurs.
- **Airway Management Audits**: Major audits have led to the development and revision of airway management algorithms to avoid and manage CICO situations.
- **Pediatric CICO Algorithms**: Released by the Difficult Airway Society UK and the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists in 2012, these algorithms lack specific instructions for pediatric techniques and equipment.
- **Terminology Confusion**: Various terms describe airway rescue during CICO emergencies, leading to confusion. Terms include 'Percutaneous Emergency Oxygenation,' 'Front of Neck Access' (FONA), and 'Emergency Cricothyroidotomy.'
- **FONA Definition**: The document uses 'Front of Neck Access' (FONA) to encompass all cannula and scalpel rescue techniques via the cricothyroid membrane or anterior tracheal wall.
- **Case Reports of CICO Deaths**: Deaths in CICO emergencies often occur due to delayed or absent rescue attempts, highlighting the need for both technical and non-technical skills.
- **Factors Contributing to Delayed Action**:
	- Environmental factors (e.g., lack of equipment familiarity)
	- Patient factors (e.g., diagnostic uncertainty)
	- Operator factors (e.g., unfamiliarity with crisis management) contribute to delayed FONA attempts.
- **Perception of Failure**: Airway clinicians may hesitate to declare a CICO emergency due to fear of being seen as having failed in airway management. The real failure is not attempting FONA when necessary.
- **Training and Equipment Standardization**: Improving non-technical skills and reducing human errors require standardized approaches, equipment, and training.
- **CICO Equipment Packs and Simulation Training**: Institutions should have pre-prepared CICO equipment packs, conduct scenario-based simulation training, and standardize FONA techniques to increase the likelihood of successful airway rescue in emergencies.
- **Institutional Approach**: The document presents an approach to equipment, techniques, and training for pediatric CICO emergencies that can be adopted or adapted by institutions.
## Review of Evidence

- **Ideal CICO Management**: Surgical tracheostomy by an ENT surgeon is ideal for managing a CICO emergency, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific Front of Neck Access (FONA) technique over another.
- **Debate on First Approach**: The choice between using a scalpel, narrow bore cannula, larger bore catheter, or emergency cricothyroidotomy set as the first approach in airway rescue remains unresolved, with various techniques and proprietary kits available.
- **Scalpel Technique**:
	- NAP4 and other sources recommend a scalpel technique in CICO emergencies unless the clinician is experienced in other techniques.
	- The generalizability of these recommendations to children is problematic due to the lack of pediatric-specific evidence.
- **Cannula vs. Scalpel in Pediatrics**:
	- Weiss and Engelhardt recommend a scalpel technique in all children, with a cannula technique as an option for those over 8 years old.
	- Cannula use may be more appropriate in neonates and small children due to the small size of the cricothyroid membrane.
- **Protective Cartilages**:
	- In adults, the cricoid and thyroid cartilages create a 'cartilaginous cage' that protects soft tissues, making a scalpel cricothyroidotomy preferable.
	- Neonates and infants have softer cartilages, offering less protection, and may benefit more from a tracheal approach.
- **Animal Model Studies**:
	- Holm-Knudsen's study using piglets demonstrated better success rates with a scalpel technique compared to cannulae, but the procedure took up to 4 minutes, which is too long in hypoxic children.
	- Rabbit model studies supported the use of a cannula FONA in children, showing high success rates.
- **Guideline Recommendations**:
	- Combined APA and DAS guidelines recommend a cannula as the first FONA technique in the absence of an ENT surgeon.
	- The small size of the neonatal cricothyroid membrane has led to caution against passing a tracheal tube through it, with some experts suggesting a tracheotomy may be preferable in neonates and infants.
- **Anatomical Considerations**:
	- Head and neck extension increases the sagittal length of the cricothyroid membrane, potentially improving access.
	- Devices for transtracheal and cricothyroidotomy are often only suitable for larger children, not neonates or infants.
![[FA6FC8C3-D435-4FE0-BBD5-370832A8C7C8_4_5005_c.jpeg]]![[4392BC24-4718-4E4B-9693-DB74EB0AEA55.jpeg]]
## Anatomical Considerations

- **Larynx Position in Children**: The larynx in small children is more cephalad compared to adults, with an underdeveloped thyroid cartilage and a more easily palpable hyoid bone.
- **Head and Neck Extension**: Maximal head and neck extension is required to approach the cricothyroid membrane (CTM) with a cannula or scalpel in children.
- **Cannula Cricothyroidotomy Challenges**: A steeper angle of approach increases the risk of posterior tracheal wall puncture. A flatter approach is preferred, but in neonates and infants, full extension may still not allow a flat enough approach, potentially necessitating a cannula tracheotomy.
- **Palpability of the Airway**: In children, the airway may be only partially palpable or not palpable at all, which could be due to their young age, trauma, or conditions like subcutaneous emphysema or tissue edema.
- **Ultrasound Use**: In semi-emergent scenarios, ultrasound may be used to identify the CTM when the anatomy is impalpable.
- **Blind Approach Risks**: A blind approach to the trachea may lead to a tracheotomy instead of a cricothyroidotomy, with evidence suggesting lower success rates for FONA when performed more distally along the trachea.
- **Cricothyroidotomy Preference**: If the CTM is palpable and can be approached at a flat angle (45° or lower), a cricothyroidotomy is preferred over a tracheotomy.
- **Thyroid Cartilage Consideration**: In children, where the thyroid cartilage is less prominent, it is recommended to aim for the most cephalad palpable airway structure below the thyroid cartilage that allows for a flat approach.
- **Tracheotomy Recommendations**: Due to the small size of the CTM in neonates and infants, a tracheotomy is often recommended to avoid damage to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, though more evidence is needed.
- **Ongoing Research**: Research into the ideal FONA technique in children is ongoing, with the hope of providing stronger evidence for specific techniques.
- **Local Procedures**: Anaesthetic, intensive care, emergency departments, and ENT surgeons should develop and understand local procedures based on current evidence, ensuring equipment is readily available in emergencies.
- **Educational Resources**: Video tutorials for FONA techniques are available online, and while they use adult models, the principles and common mistakes are applicable to children. Practicing these techniques on task trainers is recommended, with attention to the differences relevant to children.
## Narrow Bore Cannula Techniques and Jet Oxygenation

- **Video Resources**: Recommended to watch videos on Cannula Insertion, Cannulae Comparison, and Jet Oxygenation for better understanding.
	- Heard Youtube Channel. https://www. youtube.com/user/DrAMBHeardAirway. Videos for all airway techniques described in the paper may be found here. Accessed 25 April, 2016.
- **Recommended Cannula**:
	- The 16 g BD Insyte™ cannula is recommended for FONA in children due to its low cost, availability, and ability to reform shape after kinking.
	- It has a conical-shaped hub for easy wire passage during Seldinger conversion to a Melker airway.
	- Suitable for neonates, infants, and adults; 16 g cannula provides a balance between minimizing tracheal compression and allowing sufficient airflow.
- **Cannula Choice**:
	- Using a single type of cannula simplifies decision-making in emergencies.
	- Subspecialty areas like Neonatal Units may opt for an 18 g cannula instead.
- **Comparison with VBM Jet Ventilation Catheter**:
	- The BD Insyte™ is preferred over the VBM Jet Ventilation Catheter due to its ability to restraighten after kinking.
- **Cannula Tracheotomy Studies**:
	- Stacey et al. reported a 60% success rate in a rabbit model of the infant airway but noted a 42% rate of posterior wall perforation.
	- Pruntey et al. reported a 100% success rate using the Melker airway with a 50% rate of posterior wall injury.
	- These studies indicate that cannula tracheotomy is feasible in an infant model, but the high rate of tracheal injury requires further study.
- **Cannula Cricothyroidotomy**:
	- Not a definitive airway and must be held securely.
	- If not in an operating theater, an ENT surgeon should perform a formal tracheostomy at the patient’s location rather than transporting the patient.
	- Conversion to a definitive airway using a Seldinger technique is an option.
- **Goal of Cannula FONA**:
	- The primary goal is rapid and safe oxygenation to prevent end-organ damage or death.
	- Distinction between ‘Can’t Intubate, Can’t Oxygenate’ (CICO) and ‘Can’t Intubate, Can’t Ventilate’ highlights the importance of oxygenation over ventilation.
- **Risks of Jet Oxygenation**:
	- Jet oxygenation via a cannula has a high risk of barotrauma and volutrauma, particularly due to impaired expiration.
		- Atmospheric pressure (1 atm) equals 760 mmHg, 1033 cm H2O, 101 kPa, 1 bar, and 14.7 psi.
		- Piped medical oxygen and cylinder oxygen are delivered at 4 bar, and are therefore over 4000 cm H2O.
		- Jet oxygenation techniques often use wall-mounted oxygen flow meters as their oxygen source.
	- Monitoring chest rise during jet oxygenation is crucial to avoid dynamic hyperinflation.
- **Flow and Pressure Considerations**:
	- Oxygen flow meters can deliver flow rates up to 96 l/min, but they do not regulate pressure.
		- Flow meters have an indicator ball that moves within housing marked on the side to indicate the lmin1 of oxygen flow.
		- Turning the knob on the flow meter opens the flow meter’s valve increasing the flow of oxygen, and the indicator ball rises accordingly.
		- The highest flow marking at the top of the housing is usually 15 lmin1.
			- Continuing to turn the knob will open the valve further, and flow will continue to increase even though the indicator ball cannot rise above the 15 lmin1 marking on the housing.
			- Flow rates up to 96 lmin1 have been described
	- In CICO emergencies, patients may be exposed to dangerous pressures if upper airway obstruction prevents oxygen escape, leading to barotrauma.
- **Maintaining Upper Airway Patency**:
	- Attempts to maintain upper airway patency with oropharyngeal or supraglottic airways should continue during CICO management to allow egress of jetted oxygen.
- **Jet Oxygenation Devices**:
	- Devices should have a ‘true off’ switch to prevent ongoing oxygen flow after initial lung inflation.
	- Avoid devices using three-way taps as they create high resistance to outflow and can continue to inflate the chest.
- **Manujet III**:
	- Marketed for jet oxygenation in CICO emergencies but has no outlet for venting oxygen, which can lead to dangerous pressure buildup.
	- Not cost-effective to stock in all hospital locations due to its complexity and the need for familiarity in emergency situations.
- **Safer Oxygenation Devices**:
	- The Enk Oxygen Flow Modulator and Rapid O2™ Insufflator meet ideal requirements for oxygenation via a cannula.
	- The Enk provides jet oxygenation and can be switched off by uncovering its side holes.
	- The Rapid O2™ Insufflator has a T-piece with a luer lock, providing immediate tactile feedback if the cannula becomes kinked or misplaced.
- **Expert Consensus and Recommendations**:
	- Supported by expert consensus and the Advanced Paediatric Life Support group.
	- New devices like Ventrain offer active expiration but require high oxygen flow rates, and their safety in children is not yet fully established.
- **Future Considerations**:
	- Ongoing research and development of new devices are essential to improving the safety and efficacy of FONA techniques in children.
![[45063EFE-4065-4D9B-A578-B645A9F8D360.jpeg]]

## Scalpel Techniques

- **Video Resources**: Recommended to watch videos on the Scalpel Bougie Technique and Cannula Fat Neck before reading.
- **Scalpel FONA Techniques**:
	- Various techniques have been described, with the DAS 2015 Guidelines detailing a simplified version similar to Heard's video.
	- This technique is simpler than the rapid four-step method by Holmes, causing less trauma and not requiring a tissue hook.
- **Adaptation for Children**:
	- The technique must be adapted for pediatric use, with appropriately sized equipment.
	- A size 10 scalpel blade is generally suitable for pediatric cases, offering a wide incision at a shallow depth, ideal for small tracheas.
- **Bougies and Endotracheal Tubes**:
	- Different sizes are required depending on the child’s size.
	- If the airway anatomy is palpable, a horizontal stab incision is made through the cricothyroid membrane (CTM), then the scalpel is rotated to the sagittal plane, and a bougie is gently inserted until resistance is felt.
	- Hollow bougies that allow oxygenation are preferred to re-oxygenate the child, as desaturation and hypoxia-induced cardiac arrest occur more rapidly in children.
- **Oxygenation During Bougie Insertion**:
	- Cook Airway Exchange Catheters and Frova Introducers can be used with a 15 mm Rapi-Fit Adapter to deliver an inspiratory breath before advancing the endotracheal tube (ETT) over the bougie.
	- This method reduces the risk of barotrauma compared to jet oxygenation.
- **When Airway Structures Are Not Palpable**:
	- If airway structures are not palpable or if previous FONA attempts have failed, a vertical midline incision with blunt dissection is needed to identify the trachea.
	- The Scalpel-Finger-Bougie/Cannula technique is recommended in this scenario.
- **Incision Length**:
	- In adults, the recommended incision length is 8-10 cm, but this is typically too long for children.
	- The incision should start at the base of the thyroid cartilage and extend to the top of the manubrium.
- **Final Attempt to Save Life**:
	- This procedure is a last-ditch effort to save the patient's life in a highly stressful situation.
	- Concerns about bleeding and cosmetic effects are secondary to the necessity of the procedure, as failure to succeed will result in the patient’s death.
- **Preparation and Training**:
	- Personal experience is the best preparation for this situation, which is difficult to provide through education and training alone.
	- Online video content can be a useful tool to mentally prepare for this rare and stressful emergency.
## Percutaneous Cricothyroidotomy (tracheotomy) and Seldinger Techniques

- **CICO Emergency Devices**:
	- Many devices are purpose-built for CICO emergencies in children, but there is limited published evidence on their effectiveness.
	- Devices can be divided into two categories:
		- **Seldinger Technique Devices**: Inserted over a wire passed through a cannula into the trachea. Allows oxygenation via the cannula before inserting the definitive airway catheter, which is useful as it takes more time to insert the catheter, and children desaturate rapidly.
		- **Percutaneous Cricothyroidotomy (Tracheotomy) Devices**: Directly puncture the skin and enter the trachea with a large bore trocar.
- **Seldinger Devices**:
	- **Cook Melker Emergency Cricothyrotomy Catheter Set**:
		- Simple to use, available in two pediatric sizes, and successfully used in a rabbit model.
		- However, the smallest size has a 5 mm outer diameter, making it too large for neonates.
		- The wire in the Melker set does not fit through an 18 g BD Insyte cannula, complicating conversion from a successful cannula FONA.
		- Conversion to a Melker catheter should only be considered if cannula jet oxygenation begins to fail or if a formal surgical tracheostomy is not possible.
		- The Melker catheter is not packaged ready to insert and requires preparation before use.
- **Percutaneous Devices**:
	- **Risks in Young Children**:
		- These devices use large bore trocars that puncture the skin and trachea, posing a significant risk of tracheal compression and posterior wall puncture in young children.
		- The APA advises against using needles greater than 4 mm in diameter in children aged 1-8 years.
	- **Quicktrach (VBM)**:
		- Examined in rabbit models with conflicting results in small studies.
		- Comes with a shorter, wider bore needle designed for percutaneous puncture and immediate catheter advancement.
		- The smallest size has an internal diameter of 1.5 mm, approximately equivalent to a 14 g cannula.
- **Institutional Familiarity**:
	- The variety of kits available makes it difficult for staff to become familiar with all of them.
	- Each institution should choose one kit and ensure that staff are trained in its use.
- **Table 3**: Lists the smallest available size of each brand and the insertion method for each.

## Establishing an Institutional Approach to the Pediatric CICO Emergency

- **Importance of Preparation**:
	- Preparation for pediatric CICO emergencies is crucial, involving training sessions for airway clinicians and their assistants.
	- Training should include both technical skills and scenario-based simulations to improve non-technical skills like leadership, communication, and crisis management.
- **Training Frequency**:
	- Regular compulsory training for rare emergencies, such as CICO, is required by institutions like the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists to maintain competency.
	- Even with training every three years, it may still be insufficient to maintain proficiency in such rarely used skills.
- **Choosing a Technique**:
	- The lack of definitive evidence means that airway leads at each institution must decide on a preferred technique and equipment for FONA.
	- Familiarity with the chosen technique among clinicians and assistants is more important than the specific technique chosen.
- **APA Guidelines**:
	- The APA Guidelines recommend using a cannula cricothyroidotomy/tracheotomy as the first FONA technique in children aged 1–8 years if an ENT surgeon is unavailable.
	- The authors support starting with a cannula, allowing 1–2 attempts within 30 seconds before progressing to a scalpel technique if unsuccessful.
- **Psychological Aspect**:
	- A cannula may be perceived as less invasive and more familiar to anesthetists, making them more likely to perform the technique when necessary.
- **CICO Pack at Royal Children’s Hospital (RCH), Melbourne**:
	- The RCH CICO pack includes the Rapid O2 Insufflator for oxygenation via a cannula.
	- The pack contains endotracheal tubes (ETTs) and bougies for performing the scalpel bougie technique in children of various sizes, except premature neonates.
- **ETT and Bougie Selection**:
	- The pack includes cuffed ETTs in sizes 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0. A smaller ETT is preferred for ease of passage through a small incision and to minimize tracheal wall catching.
	- The pack includes the orange Portex 5Ch 50 cm tracheal tube guide, recommended for use with a size 3.0 ETT.
	- The 8Fr Frova Introducer is included for use with a size 4.0 ETT. The 14Fr Frova (blue) is recommended for adults but only fits down a size 6.0 ETT.
	- For larger children, the 11Fr Cook Airway Exchange Catheter is included as it is easier to handle despite lacking a coude tip.
- **Oxygenating Bougie**:
	- An oxygenating bougie is preferable as it allows the anesthetist to deliver a breath of 100% oxygen before advancing the ETT.
	- The 15 mm Rapi-Fit Adapter allows attachment of an anesthetic circuit for low-pressure oxygenation by squeezing the reservoir bag.
- **CICO Pack for Neonatal Units**:
	- Neonatal units may prefer to stock a 2.5 mm uncuffed ETT and smaller bougies in their CICO pack.
- **CTM Dimensions**:
	- Even with full neck and head extension, the CTM in neonates is likely small, so using a smaller ETT than for routine intubation is recommended in FONA situations.
