# Age Definitions
- **Neonates**: A baby within 44 weeks of age from the date of conception.
- **Infants**: Up to 12 months of age.
- **Child**: 1 to 12 years.
- **Adolescent**: 13 to 16 years.

# Airway and Respiratory System
- Large head, short neck, and prominent occiput.
- The tongue is relatively large in a small mouth.
- **Larynx** is high and anterior at the level of **C3-C4**.
- **Epiglottis** is long, stiff, U-shaped, and flops posteriorly; neutral head position is optimal for airway management.
- **Neonates are nasal breathers**; 50% of airway resistance arises from the nasal passages, which are easily blocked.
- **Funnel-shaped airway**: Narrowest at the cricoid cartilage, making it prone to edema with trauma.
  - 1 mm of edema can narrow a neonate's airway by **60%** due to the formula **Resistance ∝ 1/radius**.
  - Endotracheal tube placement should ensure a small leak to avoid trauma and prevent subglottic edema.
- **Endotracheal tube placement**: Must be at least 1 cm above the carina and secured to prevent dislodgement or endobronchial intubation.
- **Limited respiratory reserve** in neonates and infants.
- **Horizontal ribs** limit thoracic expansion, making ventilation primarily diaphragmatic.
- **Bulky abdominal organs** or stomach distension can impair diaphragmatic movement.
- **Chest wall compliance** is higher, leading to lower **functional residual capacity (FRC)**. FRC decreases with apnoea or anaesthesia, causing lung collapse.
- **Minute ventilation** is rate-dependent as tidal volume has limited capacity to increase.
- **Closing volume > FRC** until 6-8 years, leading to airway closure at the end of expiration.
  - **IPPV** with higher respiratory rates and PEEP are often required during anaesthesia.
  - **CPAP** improves oxygenation and reduces work of breathing during spontaneous ventilation.
- Work of respiration may account for **15% of oxygen consumption**.
- **Low type I muscle fibers** in the diaphragm predispose infants to fatigue. This increases to adult levels by the first year.
- **Alveolar development**: Only 10% of adult alveoli are present at birth, with alveolar clustering completed by 8 years.
- **Post-operative apnoea** is common in premature infants, especially if >15 seconds and associated with desaturation or bradycardia. **Caffeine (10-20 mg/kg)** may be helpful peri-operatively.
- **Respiratory Rate (RR)** = 24–(age/2).
- **Tidal volume (TV)**: Spontaneous ventilation TV = **6-8 ml/kg**; IPPV TV = **7-10 ml/kg**.
- **Physiological dead space**: 30%, increased with anaesthetic equipment.

# Cardiovascular System
- **Neonatal myocardium**: Less contractile and less compliant, making cardiac output **rate-dependent**.
- **Vagal tone dominance**: Neonates and infants are prone to **bradycardia**, which reduces cardiac output.
  - Hypoxia-induced bradycardia should be managed with **oxygen and ventilation**.
  - **External compressions** if HR < 60 bpm or 60-80 bpm with inadequate ventilation.
- **Cardiac output**: **300-400 ml/kg/min** at birth, decreasing to **200 ml/kg/min** within months.
- **Sinus arrhythmia** is common in children; other arrhythmias are abnormal.
- **Ductus arteriosus** closes within 2-4 weeks; **foramen ovale** closure is pressure-dependent but may remain patent for up to 5 years.
- Pulmonary vasculature can revert to fetal circulation with **hypoxia or acidosis** in the first few weeks.
- **Normal Blood Volumes**:
  - Newborn: **85-90 ml/kg**
  - 6 weeks to 2 years: **85 ml/kg**
  - 2 years to puberty: **80 ml/kg**

# Renal System
- **Low renal blood flow and glomerular filtration** for the first two years due to high renal vascular resistance.
- **Immature tubular function** until 8 months, limiting sodium excretion.
- **Dehydration poorly tolerated**, particularly in premature infants with increased insensible losses due to large surface area relative to weight.
- **Extracellular fluid** proportion: 40% of body weight in children (vs. 20% in adults).
- **Urine output**: **1-2 ml/kg/hr**.

# Hepatic System
- **Liver function is immature** at birth, resulting in slower metabolism of drugs like barbiturates and opioids.

# Glucose Metabolism
- **Hypoglycaemia** is common in stressed neonates; glucose levels should be monitored.
  - Infants and older children rarely need glucose infusions, but 10% glucose may be infused in neonates to prevent neurological damage.
- **Hyperglycaemia** is usually iatrogenic.

# Haematology
- **HbF** constitutes 70-90% of haemoglobin at birth, dropping to 5% by 3 months as **HbA** increases.
  - **HbF** binds oxygen more readily but releases it less efficiently due to lower **2,3-DPG** levels.
  - **HbF** provides protection against red cell sickling.
- **Oxygen-Hb dissociation curve** shifts to the right as HbA and 2,3-DPG increase.
- **Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors** (II, VII, IX, X) and platelet function are deficient initially; **Vitamin K** is administered at birth.
- **Transfusion** is generally recommended if 15% of circulating blood volume is lost.

# Temperature Control
- Infants have a **large surface area to weight ratio**, minimal subcutaneous fat, and underdeveloped mechanisms for thermoregulation.
- **Brown fat** (2-6% of body weight) is used for non-shivering thermogenesis.
- Heat loss occurs primarily via **radiation**, but also conduction, convection, and evaporation.
  - Optimal ambient temperature to prevent heat loss:
	- Premature infants: **34°C**
	- Neonates: **32°C**
	- Adolescents/adults: **28°C**
- **Hypothermia** leads to respiratory depression, acidosis, reduced cardiac output, prolonged drug effects, and increased infection risk.

# Central Nervous System (CNS)
- Neonates experience pain, evident by increased **HR, BP**, and neuroendocrine responses.
- **Blood-brain barrier** is poorly formed, allowing drugs to cross more easily and resulting in prolonged effects.
- **Fragile cerebral vessels** in preterm infants increase the risk of **intraventricular haemorrhage**, exacerbated by hypoxia, hypercarbia, or blood pressure fluctuations.

# Psychology
- **Infants <6 months** are usually not distressed by parental separation.
- **Children <4 years** are upset by separation and unfamiliar surroundings, making rationalization difficult.
- **School-age children** fear surgical procedures and associated pain or disfigurement.
- **Adolescents** fear narcosis, pain, loss of control, and long hospitalizations.
- **Parental anxiety** is easily perceived by children.
