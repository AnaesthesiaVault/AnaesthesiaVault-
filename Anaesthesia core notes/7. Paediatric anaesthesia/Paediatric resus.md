# Paediatric Advanced Life Support
### Management of Respiratory Failure in Seriously Ill or Injured Children and Infants
- **Oxygen Therapy**: Start if SpO2 < 94%, or 3% below baseline for those with chronic conditions.
	- Target SpO2 between 94-98% using minimal supplemental oxygen.
	- Avoid sustained 100% SpO2, except in specific cases like carbon monoxide poisoning.
	- Do not give oxygen pre-emptively without signs of hypoxaemia or shock.
- **Non-Responsive to Low-Flow Oxygen**: Consider humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or CPAP/non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for children with respiratory failure and adequate respiratory drive.
- **Bag-Mask Ventilation (BMV)**: First-line method for ventilation support.
	- 2-person technique recommended, especially if ventilation is challenging or if disease transmission risk exists.
	- Airway adjuncts may be considered.
- **Failed BMV**: If oxygenation/ventilation does not improve or prolonged ventilation is needed, consider early use of a supraglottic airway (SGA) or tracheal intubation.
- **Tracheal Intubation**: Use cuffed tracheal tubes (TT) except in neonates, monitor cuff pressure (usually <20 cm H2O).
	- Always use capnography in intubated children to detect tube malposition.
### Management of Circulatory Failure
- **Shock Protocols**: Healthcare systems should have protocols for managing shock, including early recognition and treatment.
	- No single clinical finding can reliably gauge shock severity; frequent reassessment is needed.
	- Consider clinical signs like mean arterial blood pressure, lactate trends, urine output, and ultrasound (if competent).
- **Vascular Access**:
	- First choice: Peripheral IV lines, limit time to 5 minutes (or 2 attempts).
	- Ultrasound may assist in cannulation. Consider intraosseous (IO) access early if IV success is unlikely.
- **Intraosseous (IO) Access**:
	- Primary rescue alternative, all providers should be competent in IO insertion and receive regular retraining.
	- Provide intraosseous analgesia unless the child is comatose.
	- Confirm IO placement clinically, and monitor for extravasation (risk of compartment syndrome).
### Fluid Administration in Shock

- **Fluid Boluses**: In UK healthcare with intensive care, give 10 mL/kg bolus, repeat up to 40-60 mL/kg within the first hour.
	- Reassess after each bolus and discontinue if signs of fluid overload (hepatomegaly, crackles, jugular venous distention) appear.
- **Intubation in Septic Shock**:
	- Timing unclear, but generally indicated in fluidand inotrope-resistant shock even without respiratory failure.
- **Fluid Choices**:
	- Use balanced isotonic crystalloids as first choice; normal saline (0.9%) is acceptable if not available.
	- For hypovolaemic non-haemorrhagic shock, give rapid fluid boluses.
- **Haemorrhagic Shock**:
	- Limit crystalloid boluses (max 20 mL/kg).
	- Consider early use of blood products in severe trauma with circulatory failure.
	- Aim to prevent fluid overload while maintaining tissue perfusion until definitive treatment (e.g., surgery).
	- **Permissive hypotension** (MAP at 5th percentile for age) may be used but avoid in children with brain injury (e.g., traumatic brain injury).

![[94FB7C29-6D34-4C1A-9119-54A4EA3A5D81.jpeg]]

### Tranexamic Acid (TxA)
- **Indication**: Administer TxA to all children and infants needing transfusion after severe trauma/significant haemorrhage.
- **Timing**: Give as soon as possible, ideally within 3 hours of injury.
### Fluid Management
- **Febrile Illness**: Children and infants with febrile illness but no signs of shock should **not** receive fluid bolus therapy.
- **Persistent Circulatory Failure**: Start vasoactive drugs early in children with persistent decompensated circulatory failure after multiple fluid boluses.
### Vasoactive Drugs
- **First-Line Drugs**: Use noradrenaline or adrenaline (dopamine is no longer recommended but can be used if others are unavailable).
- **Competence**: Paediatric Also providers should be competent in the use of vasoactive drugs during the first hour of stabilisation.
### Septic Shock Management
- **Antibiotics**: Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics as soon as possible after the ABCDE assessment (ideally within the first hour). Obtain blood cultures before starting antibiotics if it does not delay therapy.
### Cardioversion for Tachycardias
- **Decompensated SVT or VT**: Immediate cardioversion with initial energy of 1 J/kg, increasing to 2 J/kg if unsuccessful, and up to 4 J/kg with expert guidance.
	- Provide sedation/analgesia (e.g., intranasal or IM ketamine) in conscious patients, or IV if rapid access is available without delaying cardioversion.
- **Stable SVT**:
	- Try vagal manoeuvres (ice immersion, Valsalva) first.
	- If unsuccessful, use **adenosine** (dose adjusted by age):
		- **Neonates (birth-28 days)**: Start with 150 micrograms/kg IV; increase by 50-100 micrograms/kg every 1-2 minutes until tachycardia is terminated or maximum dose of 300 micrograms/kg is reached.
		- **Infants (1-11 months)**: Start with 150 micrograms/kg IV; increase by 50-100 micrograms/kg every 1-2 minutes until tachycardia is terminated or maximum dose of 500 micrograms/kg.
		- **Children (12 months-11 years)**: Start with 100 micrograms/kg IV; increase by 50-100 micrograms/kg every 1-2 minutes until tachycardia is terminated or maximum dose of 500 micrograms/kg (max 12 mg).
		- **Children (12-17 years)**: Start with 3 mg IV, then increase to 6 mg and 12 mg if needed.
	- Give **adenosine** rapidly via IV bolus followed by saline flush, ensuring rhythm strip is recorded.
- **Caution with Adenosine**:
	- Avoid in children with:
		- sinus node disease
		- pre-excited atrial arrhythmias
		- heart transplants
		- severe asthma.
	- Use alternative medications with expert consultation if needed.
### Wide QRS Tachycardias
- **Uncertain Mechanism**: Treat wide QRS tachycardia as VT if the mechanism is not clear.
	- Use vagal manoeuvres to gain insight into the arrhythmia mechanism.
	- **Torsades de Points**: Administer **magnesium** 25-50 mg/kg (max 2 g), over 10-15 minutes, and repeat if necessary.
### Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)
- **Quality CPR**: Ensure high-quality CPR with:
	- Correct depth and rate of chest compressions (100-120/min).
	- Chest compression fraction ≥80%.
	- Full chest recoil after each compression.
- **Ventilation Rates** (post-tracheal intubation):
	- Infants: 25 breaths/min.
	- Children 1-8 years: 20 breaths/min.
	- Children 8-12 years: 15 breaths/min.
	- Children >12 years: 10-12 breaths/min.
- **End-Tidal CO₂ Monitoring**: Use for all intubated children to confirm correct tube placement and assess CPR quality.
### Non-Shockable Rhythms
- **Adrenaline**: Administer as soon as possible for non-shockable rhythms (e.g., asystole, PEA).
	- First dose: 10 micrograms/kg (0.1 mL/kg of 1 in 10,000 solution), ideally within 3 minutes of arrest.
	- Repeat every 3-5 minutes.
### Post-Resuscitation Care
- **Post-ROSC**: Avoid hypoxia, hypotension, and fever.
	- **Temperature Management**: Use normothermia or mild hypothermia with continuous temperature monitoring.

## Introduction to PALS Guidelines
- **Guidelines Basis (2021)**:
	- Based on International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) 2020 recommendations and European Resuscitation Council (ERC) 2021 Advanced Life Support guidelines.
	- Cardiac arrest management for COVID-19 patients not included but covered in RCUK’s COVID-19 guidance.
- **Guidelines Development**:
	- Accredited by NICE.
	- Systematic reviews with evidence grading.
	- Involvement of stakeholders worldwide, including the public and cardiac arrest survivors.
	- Development process available in RCUK Guidelines Development Process Manual.
- **Paediatric Resuscitation Overview**:
	- Applies to infants and children (excludes newborn infants).
	- Differences between adult and paediatric resuscitation due to varying causes.
	- For suspected children, follow paediatric guidelines.
	- Misjudging age (child vs. young adult) likely causes little harm.
- **Cardiorespiratory Arrest in Children/Infants**:
	- Often due to respiratory or circulatory failure leading to hypoxia.
	- Early intervention is crucial to prevent progression to cardiac arrest.
- **Systematic Assessment & ABCDE Principles**:
	- Airway (including cervical spine stabilisation if injured).
	- Breathing.
	- Circulation (with haemorrhage control in injury cases).
	- Disability (consciousness and neurological status).
	- Exposure (full examination while maintaining dignity and temperature).
- **Advanced Life Support (Also) Teamwork**:
	- Also is a team activity with parallel interventions.
	- Also teams must train for teamwork and intervention choreography.
- **Clinical Response Systems**:
	- Early warning scores can reduce critical incidents but not mortality.
	- Paediatric rapid response teams (RRT) or medical emergency teams (MET) should be part of hospital systems to reduce cardiac or respiratory arrest.
- **Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Sequence**
	- Recognise cardiac arrest via clinical signs or vital signs.
	- Start CPR immediately for bradycardia (heart rate < 60 bpm) with inadequate perfusion.
- **Oxygenation, Ventilation, & Chest Compressions**
	- Ensure a patent airway; provide ventilation with 100% oxygen.
	- Use bag-mask ventilation (BMV) if possible.
	- Intubation only if necessary, using ETCO2 to confirm tube placement.
	- Continue chest compressions at 100–120 per minute.
- **Defibrillation & Monitoring**:
	- Use defibrillator pads to monitor cardiac rhythm.
	- For infants, use front and back chest positions.
		- Use the largest size pads that fit the chest without touching each other. Pads for children should be 8–12 cm in size, and 4.5 cm for infants.
		- Avoid contact between the pads as this will create charge arcing if defibrillation is needed.
	- Continue CPR while charging the defibrillator.
	- For shockable rhythms (VF/pVT), give 1 shock (4 J/kg) and resume CPR immediately.
- **Adrenaline & Other Medications**:
	- Administer adrenaline (10 mcg/kg IV) during non-shockable rhythms as soon as possible.
	- Continue adrenaline every 3–5 minutes during CPR.
- **Reversible Causes (4 Hs and 4 Ts)**:
	- Hypoxia, hypovolaemia, hyper/hypokalaemia, hypothermia/hyperthermia.
	- Thromboembolism, tension pneumothorax, tamponade, toxic/therapeutic disturbances.
- **Shockable Rhythm Protocol**:
	- Defibrillate immediately for VF/pVT (shockable rhythm).
	- Administer adrenaline and amiodarone (or lidocaine as an alternative) after the third shock.
	- Continue shocks every 2 minutes with minimal breaks.
- **Monitoring & After Care**:
	- Use ETCO2 monitoring for CPR quality.
	- ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation) indicates post-resuscitation care.
	- If rhythm changes or VF/pVT recurs, resume CPR and defibrillation.
- **Post-Event Debriefing**:
	- Team debriefing improves practice and is recommended after resuscitation.
## Additional PALS Notes
- **Tracheal Tubes (TT)**:
	- Cuffed TT is recommended for paediatric Also (except neonates).
	- Cuffed TT is safer and often preferable for certain conditions (e.g., poor lung compliance).
- **Alternative Airways**:
	- Supraglottic devices (e.g., LMA, i-gel) can be used when BMV fails or is difficult.
	- Supraglottic airways do not totally protect the airway from aspiration of secretions, blood or stomach contents, and therefore close observation is required as their use is associated with a higher incidence of complications in small children compared with older children or adults.
- **Capnography**:
	- ETCO2 monitoring confirms tracheal tube placement and assesses CPR quality.
	- Monitoring ETCO2 with waveform capnography reliably confirms tracheal tube placement in a child or infant weighing more than 2 kg with a perfusing rhythm and must be used after intubation and during transport of an intubated child or infant.
	- Low ETCO2 may indicate poor cardiac output or chest compression quality.
	- Be careful when interpreting ETCO2 values after giving adrenaline or other vasoconstrictor drugs when there may be a transient decrease in ETCO2, or after the use of sodium bicarbonate when there may be a transient increase in the end-tidal values.
		- Current evidence does not support the use of a threshold ETCO2 value as an indicator for stopping the resuscitation attempt.
- **Transcutaneous Pacing**:
	- Useful in bradycardia due to heart block but not in hypoxic/ischaemic arrest.
- **Physiological Monitoring During CPR**:
	- Invasive blood pressure, ETCO2, and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can guide CPR efforts in critical care settings.
- **Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS)**:
	- Useful for identifying reversible causes of cardiac arrest but should not interfere with CPR.
	- Image acquisition is best done during pauses for rhythm check and/or for ventilations; the team should plan and anticipate (choreography) to make the most of the available seconds for imaging.
- **Point of Care Serum Values**:
	- Serum sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium can be used to identify reversible causes but not for prognosis.
### Reversible Causes (4 Hs and 4 Ts)
- **Hypoxia**
- **Hypovolemia**
- **Hypo-/Hyperkalaemia or metabolic imbalances**
- **Hypo-/Hyperthermia**
- **Tension pneumothorax**
- **Tamponade (cardiac)**
- **Thrombosis (coronary or pulmonary)**
- **Toxins**
Continue monitoring and adjusting treatment based on physiological responses during CPR.

### Cardiac Arrest in Special Circumstances
- **CPR in Specific Conditions**: Conditions such as cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, trauma, drowning, sepsis, and pulmonary hypertension require a tailored approach. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is increasingly used for refractory cardiac arrest (E-CPR).
	- Institutions performing paediatric cardiothoracic surgery should have specific algorithms for cardiac arrest after surgery.
#### Traumatic Cardiac Arrest (TCA)
- Start standard CPR while addressing reversible causes:
	- Airway opening and oxygen ventilation.
	- Control external haemorrhage (use tourniquets for exsanguination).
	- Bilateral thoracostomy or needle thoracocentesis.
	- IO/IV access and fluid resuscitation with blood products or full blood.
	- Use pelvic binders for blunt trauma.
- Consider emergency department thoracotomy for penetrating trauma. In certain EMS systems, pre-hospital thoracotomy may be an option for highly trained professionals.
#### Hypothermic Arrest
- Start standard CPR.
- If deep hypothermia (<28°C) is present and continuous CPR is not possible, consider delayed or intermittent CPR.
- Transport the patient to a centre with extracorporeal life support (ECLS) or cardiopulmonary bypass capacity if favourable outcomes are expected.
#### Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS)
- **E-CPR**: Implement veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in cases of refractory in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) with presumed reversible causes.
- Consider E-CPR early in children with decompensated cardiorespiratory failure (e.g., refractory septic shock or cardiomyopathy).
- **Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA)**: E-CPR may be considered in hypothermic cardiac arrest or if pre-hospital cannulation is possible by highly trained teams.
#### Septic Shock
- No evidence supports altering the standard cardiac arrest algorithm.
#### Single Ventricle Circulation
- No modifications to the standard cardiac arrest algorithm are recommended.
- Before repair, infants with shock from elevated pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratios may benefit from inducing mild hypercarbia.
#### Hemi-Fontan/Fontan Circulation
- Standard cardiac arrest algorithm applies.
- Mild hypercarbia via hypoventilation may improve oxygenation and cardiac output.
- Early ECPR may be considered for refractory cardiac arrest.
- **Negative Pressure Ventilation**: May be helpful in Hemi-Fontan or Fontan circulation to increase cardiac output.
#### Pulmonary Hypertension (PHT)
- Perform standard CPR and attempt to correct hypercarbia.
- Consider inhaled nitric oxide or aerosolised prostacyclin (PGI2).
- **Post-Operative Care**: Focus on avoiding hypoxia and acidosis.
### Drugs and Fluids Used in CPR

#### Body Weight Estimations
1. Use actual body weight if known.
2. Use body length tape with pre-calculated drug doses.
3. Use a paediatric emergency drug chart.
4. Use an age-based weight calculation formula (e.g., weight (kg) = (age + 4) x 2, up to 10 years).
5. For obese patients, use ideal body weight to avoid drug toxicity.
#### Intravenous or Intraosseous Access
- IO access is acceptable for vascular access in infants and children during cardiac arrest or when IV access is not available.
#### Adrenaline
- **Action**: Causes vasoconstriction, improves coronary and cerebral perfusion, and enhances myocardial contractility.
- **Non-Shockable Rhythms**: Give adrenaline as soon as access is established, ideally within 3 minutes.
- **Shockable Rhythms**: Administer adrenaline after the third shock and then after every alternate shock.
- **Dose**: 10 mcg/kg (0.1 mL/kg of 1 in 10,000 solution), repeated every 3-5 minutes.
#### Amiodarone
- **Action**: Stabilises membranes, prolongs action potential and refractory periods, and slows atrioventricular conduction.
- **Shockable Rhythms**: Administer 5 mg/kg IV after the third defibrillation. Repeat after the fifth shock if still in VF/pVT.
- **Caution**: Infuse slowly over at least 3 minutes in perfusing rhythms to avoid bradycardia and hypotension.
- **Dose**:
	- **Neonate**: 5 mg/kg IV.
	- **Child**: 5 mg/kg IV (max 300 mg).
#### Lidocaine
- **Action**: Blocks sodium channels, reduces cardiac contractions, shortens action potential.
- **Dose**:
	- **Neonate**: 0.5-1 mg/kg IV, followed by 0.6-3 mg/kg/hour infusion.
	- **Child (1 month–11 years)**: 0.5-1 mg/kg IV, followed by 0.6-3 mg/kg/hour infusion.
	- **Child (12-17 years)**: 50-100 mg IV, followed by 120 mg infusion over 30 minutes, then 240 mg over 2 hours.
#### Atropine
- **Action**: Increases heart rate by reducing vagal tone.
- **Dose**:
	- **Neonates and Children (1 month–11 years)**: 20 mcg/kg IV.
	- **Children (12-17 years)**: 300-600 mcg IV.
#### Magnesium
- **Action**: Aids enzymatic reactions and stabilises cell membranes, indicated for hypomagnesaemia or torsades de points.
- **Dose (Torsades de Points)**: 25-50 mg/kg (max 2 g) over 10-15 minutes, repeat if necessary.
#### Calcium
- **Action**: Essential for myocardial contraction but high levels can harm the ischaemic myocardium.
- **Indication**: Use in hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypermagnesemia, or calcium-channel blocker overdose.
- **Dose (Severe Hyperkalaemia)**:
	- **Neonate**: 0.5 mL/kg (0.11 mmol/kg) over 5-10 minutes, repeat if ECG changes persist.
	- **Child**: 0.5 mL/kg (0.11 mmol/kg) over 5-10 minutes (max 6.75 mmol).
#### Sodium Bicarbonate
- Routine use is not recommended due to risks of intracellular acidosis, negative inotropic effects, and oxygen dissociation interference
	- shifts oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve to the left
- Consider in prolonged arrests, hyperkalaemia, and tricyclic antidepressant overdose.
### Fluids in CPR
- **Hypovolaemia**: Rapidly administer IV or IO fluids in suspected hypovolaemia (10 mL/kg boluses).
- Use balanced crystalloids or 0.9% saline, and avoid dextrose-based solutions for volume replacement.
### Parental Presence During Resuscitation
- Many parents prefer to be present during resuscitation attempts to gain a realistic understanding of the situation.
- Parental presence can reduce anxiety and depression in bereaved families and encourage professional behaviour among healthcare providers.
- A dedicated staff member should guide and support parents during the process.
### Termination of Resuscitation
- No specific time frame defines when to stop resuscitation efforts.
- Factors to consider include arrest circumstances, rhythm, resuscitation duration, and conditions such as hypothermia or metabolic derangement.
- Some children have survived with good neurological outcomes after more than 20 minutes of resuscitation (excluding hypothermic cases).
### Post-Cardiac Arrest Care (PCAC)
- **Haemodynamic Support**:
	- Avoid hypotension (MAP < 5th percentile for age); aim for BP between 5th-50th percentile.
	- Titrate fluids and vasoactive drugs to maintain good cerebral perfusion and monitor serum lactate and cardiac output.
	- Use minimal doses of fluids and drugs necessary, adjusting interventions based on physiological responses.
- **Ventilation**:
	- Provide normal ventilatory rate and tidal volume for age, aiming for normal PaCO2 (4.5-6 kPa).
	- Avoid hypocarbia and hypercarbia.
	- In children with chronic lung disease or congenital heart conditions, aim for the child’s normal PaCO2/PaO2 values.
	- Do not use ETCO2 alone as a surrogate for PaCO2 without proven correlation.
- **Oxygenation**:
	- Titrate FiO2 to maintain normoxaemia (PaO2 10-13 kPa) or SpO2 between 94-98%.
	- Maintain high FiO2 in cases of presumed carbon monoxide poisoning or severe anaemia.
- **Targeted Temperature Management (TTM)**:
	- Avoid fever (≥ 37.5°C), maintain normothermia (36.5°C, range 36-37.2°C).
	- Therapeutic hypothermia (32-34°C) should only be used in centres with appropriate paediatric expertise and critical care systems.
- **Glucose Control**:
	- Monitor blood glucose closely, avoiding hypoand hyperglycaemia.
	- Be cautious of tight glucose control, as it may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia.
- **Prognostication**:
	- Use multiple variables across pre-, intra-, and post-cardiac arrest phases for outcome prediction (e.g., biological markers, EEG, SSEP, neuroimaging).
	- No single factor should be used in isolation for prognostication.
- **Organ Donation**:
	- Consider comatose children with ROSC or those meeting neurological death criteria as potential organ donors.
	- Refer to a specialist organ donation team if withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment is planned.
- **Unexplained Cardiac Arrest**:
	- Take a detailed history (syncope, seizures, family history of sudden death) to assess for inheritable heart disease.
	- Review any prior ECGs and consider specialist evaluation for inherited cardiac conditions.
	- If the patient does not survive, a postmortem should include tissue analysis for channelopathies, and the family should be referred to an expert in inherited cardiac diseases.

# Neonatal Resuscitation

### Newborn Life Support Guidelines Overview
- Developed by the **Resuscitation Council UK (RCUK)** in line with:
	
	- **International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) 2020 Consensus** on Neonatal Life Support (CoSTR 2019 & 2020)
	- **European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Guidelines** for newborn resuscitation and transition support.
- Covers both **term and preterm infant** management.
- COVID-19 considerations:
	- **RCUK and ERC guidelines** for newborn life support during the pandemic, based on an **ILCOR CoSTR** and systematic review.
	- The **risk of COVID-19 transmission** to infants and healthcare providers is evolving; regularly check the **RCUK website** for updates.
- **RCUK 2021 Guidelines development**:
	- Accredited by the **National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)**.
	- Involves **systematic reviews**, grading evidence certainty, and making recommendations.
	- Supports the **ILCOR Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science** with treatment recommendations.
	- Includes input from **global stakeholders**, public members, and cardiac arrest survivors.
- For further details, refer to the **Resuscitation Council UK Guidelines Development Process Manual**.
### Pre-Delivery Considerations
#### Transition and Need for Assistance Post-Birth
- Most newborns adapt to extra-uterine life without intervention.
	- **85% breathe spontaneously**.
	- **10% require assistance** with drying, stimulation, or airway opening.
	- **5% need positive pressure ventilation**.
	- **Intubation rates**: 0.4% to 2%.
	- **Chest compressions required**: <0.3%.
	- **Adrenaline administration**: 0.05%.
#### Risk Factors

- Multiple **risk factors** can increase the likelihood of requiring resuscitation or stabilisation (see Figure 1).
	- Local guidelines should determine **who attends deliveries** based on best practices and clinical audits.

![[8E787D1C-58B9-4A36-BC26-674BD162D39E.jpeg]]

### Delivery Attendance and Preparation
#### Staffing at Delivery
- **Competent personnel** trained in **newborn life support** should be available for all deliveries.
- If resuscitation is needed:
	- At least one staff member should be assigned to focus exclusively on the newborn.
- A process should be in place for **mobilising a resuscitation team** as needed.

#### Equipment and Environment

- All **resuscitation equipment** must be regularly checked and immediately accessible.
- Delivery environments should be:
	- **Warm, well-lit, draught-free**.
	- Include a **flat resuscitation surface** and **radiant heater** (if available).
	- **Monitoring and ventilation equipment** should be on hand.
	- **Additional resuscitation equipment** should be easily accessible.
## Planned Home Deliveries

- **Two trained professionals** should attend home deliveries.
	- At least one must be skilled in **mask ventilation** and **chest compressions** for newborns.
- Guidelines for attending home deliveries may vary, but:
	- Initial **assessment, stabilisation, and resuscitation** standards must not be compromised.
	- The limitations of **advanced resuscitation at home** should be communicated to the mother.
- **Resuscitation equipment** of appropriate size should be available.
- Care providers must have **pre-defined plans** for emergencies.
- In unexpected deliveries outside hospitals, **emergency services** must be trained and equipped for neonatal resuscitation.
### Minimum Equipment for Newborn Resuscitation and Support of Transition of Infants at Birth in the Pre-Hospital Setting

## Team Briefing

- Conduct a **team briefing** if time allows:
	- Define roles, tasks, and responsibilities.
	- Review equipment and the resuscitation plan.
- **Checklists** are helpful for preparation.
- Prepare the family if **resuscitation is anticipated**.
### Training and Education Recommendations for Newborn Resuscitation

- Newborn resuscitation providers must maintain current knowledge, as well as technical and non-technical skills.
- Structured educational programs are essential to teach the required knowledge and skills for newborn resuscitation.
- Program content and organization should be tailored to the needs of the providers and institutions.
- Essential components of training programs include:
	- **Newborn life support training** conducted by qualified instructors.
	- **Regular practice sessions and drills**.
	- **Simulation-based training**, incorporating team and leadership skills.
	- **Feedback**, as well as performance-focused debriefing and reflection.
- Training should ideally be conducted **at least once per year**.
### Thermal Control Recommendations and Standards

- **Regular monitoring** of the infant’s temperature after birth is essential, with the **admission temperature recorded** as a prognostic and quality indicator.
- Newborn temperature should be maintained between **36.5 °C and 37.5 °C**.
- Avoid **hypothermia** (≤ 36.0 °C) and **hyperthermia** (> 38.0 °C).
- In specific situations, **therapeutic hypothermia** may be considered following resuscitation (refer to post-resuscitation care).
#### Environment Considerations

- Ensure protection from **draughts** by closing windows and properly programming air-conditioning.
- Keep delivery rooms and theatres warm between **23-25 °C**.
- For infants born ≤ 28 weeks gestation, maintain room temperature above **25 °C**.
### Term and Near-Term Infants (> 32 Weeks Gestation)

- **Dry the infant immediately** after delivery.
- Cover the infant’s **head and body** with a warm towel.
- If resuscitation is not needed, place the infant **skin-to-skin with the mother**, covered by a towel, and monitor to maintain normothermia.
- If support for transition or resuscitation is required, place the infant on a **preheated radiant warmer**.
### Preterm Infants (≤ 32 Weeks Gestation)

- Completely cover the infant (except the face) with **polyethylene wrapping** without drying, and use a radiant warmer.
- If umbilical cord clamping is delayed and a radiant warmer is unavailable, use other thermal control measures (e.g., increased room temperature, warm blankets, thermal mattress).
- **Skin-to-skin care** is possible but requires caution, especially in extremely preterm or growth-restricted infants to avoid hypothermia.
- For infants on respiratory support, consider using **warmed, humidified respiratory gases**.
- A **quality improvement program** involving checklists and continuous feedback has been shown to reduce hypothermia at admission in very preterm infants.
### Out-of-Hospital Management

- Infants born outside of standard delivery environments are at higher risk of **hypothermia** and poor outcomes.
- Consider placing these infants in a **food-grade plastic bag** after drying, followed by swaddling.
- Well newborns (> 30 weeks gestation) can be **dried and nursed skin-to-skin** during transfer if the mother is normothermic.
- Ensure infants are protected from **draughts**, and carefully monitor their **airway and breathing** during transfer.
### Management of the Umbilical Cord After Birth

- Discuss cord clamping options and rationale with parents before birth.
- **Delay cord clamping** for at least 60 seconds if immediate resuscitation or stabilization is not required (longer may be beneficial).
- Ideally, clamp the cord **after lung aeration**.
- If possible, perform initial resuscitation or stabilization while the cord remains intact.
- **Cord milking** can be considered for infants > 28 weeks gestation when delayed clamping is not possible.
### Initial Assessment

- Conduct a rapid initial assessment **before cord clamping**:
	- Observe **tone** and **colour**.
	- Assess **breathing adequacy**.
	- Count the **heart rate**.
	- Ensure the baby is kept **warm**.
- This initial assessment establishes a baseline, determines the need for support or resuscitation, and informs the duration of delayed cord clamping.
- **Reassess heart rate and breathing** frequently to guide further interventions.
### Tactile Stimulation

- Stimulate the infant during the initial handling by:
	- **Drying the infant**.
	- Gently rubbing the **soles of the feet or back**.
	- Avoid aggressive stimulation.
### Tone and Colour

- **Floppy infants** are likely to need respiratory support.
- **Colour** is unreliable for judging oxygenation (cyanosis may be difficult to recognize).
- **Pallor** may indicate shock or hypovolemia; consider **blood loss**.
### Breathing

- Assess breathing for **rate, depth, symmetry**, and effort:
	- **Adequate** breathing.
	- **Inadequate** breathing patterns (e.g., gasping or grunting).
	- **Absent** breathing.
### Heart Rate

- Measure heart rate using a **stethoscope**, **saturation monitor**, or **ECG**.
	- **Fast (≥ 100 bpm)**: Satisfactory.
	- **Slow (60-100 bpm)**: Intermediate, possible hypoxia.
	- **Very slow/absent (< 60 bpm)**: Critical, hypoxia likely.
- Begin **respiratory support** if the infant does not establish effective breathing or if the heart rate does not increase.
### Classification According to Initial Assessment

- Based on initial assessment, infants can be classified into groups:
	- **Preterm infants**: Manage as term infants with additional thermal care (e.g., polyethylene wrap), apply **CPAP** if breathing is inadequate, and monitor with a saturation probe and ECG.
	- **Newborn life support**: Continue respiratory support if breathing is inadequate or heart rate < 100 bpm.

### Airway Management

- **Commence life support** if the infant has inadequate breathing or a heart rate < 100 bpm.
- Ensure an **open airway**:
	- Position the infant on their back with the head in a **neutral position**.
	- For floppy infants, use a **jaw lift** to help open the airway and reduce mask leaks.
	- **Two-person airway support** with a mask is more effective than single-person methods.
- Alternative airway methods:
	- **Laryngeal mask** for infants ≥ 34 weeks gestation (~2000g).
	- **Oropharyngeal airway** as an alternative, but may obstruct the airway in infants < 34 weeks.
	- **Nasopharyngeal airway** can be used if other methods fail.
### Airway Obstruction

- **Airway obstruction** may be due to poor positioning, decreased airway tone, or laryngeal adduction (especially in preterm infants).
- **Suction** is needed only if confirmed airway obstruction from mucus, vernix, meconium, blood clots, etc., is seen during inspection.
- Use **suction under direct vision** with a laryngoscope and a wide bore catheter.
### Meconium

- **Non-vigorous infants** born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid are at high risk of needing advanced resuscitation.
- Follow the standard **NLS algorithm**. If chest rise is not seen after 5 inflation breaths, reposition and deliver 5 more. Inspect the airway under direct vision.
- Routine suctioning in non-vigorous infants delays ventilation and is not recommended.
- **Tracheal intubation** may be required to relieve airway obstruction in rare cases.
### Initial Inflations and Assisted Ventilation

- **Start positive pressure ventilation (PPV)** within 60 seconds if the infant is apneic, gasping, or not breathing effectively.
- Use a well-fitting mask for PPV and ensure a **good mask seal**.
- Deliver 5 **inflation breaths**, each lasting 2-3 seconds.
- **Inflation pressures**:
	- Term: 30 cm H2O.
	- Preterm: 25 cm H2O.
- **Oxygen percentages**:
	- > 32 weeks: 21%.
		
	- 28-32 weeks: 21-30%.
	- < 28 weeks: 30%.
### Assessment of Ventilation

- **Heart rate**:
	- An increasing heart rate within 30 seconds indicates adequate ventilation/oxygenation.
	- A slow heart rate suggests continued hypoxia, likely due to inadequate ventilation.
- **Chest movement**:
	- Visible chest movement indicates a patent airway and effective ventilation.
	- Lack of chest movement suggests airway obstruction or insufficient inflation pressure.
### Continuing Ventilation

- If there is a **heart rate response**:
	- Continue ventilation until the infant breathes adequately and heart rate > 100 bpm.
	- Ventilate at about **30 breaths per minute**, with ~1 second inflation times.
	- Reassess heart rate and breathing every 30 seconds.
	- Consider a **more secure airway** (laryngeal mask or tracheal tube) if apnea persists or mask ventilation is ineffective.
### Failure to Respond

- If no heart rate response and chest movement is absent:
	- **Recheck** equipment, head position, jaw lift, mask size, and seal.
	- Repeat 5 **inflation breaths**.
	- If airway obstruction is present, consider:
		- **Two-person mask support**.
		- Suction of the pharynx under direct vision.
		- **Tracheal intubation** or insertion of a laryngeal mask.
		- **Oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal airway** if other methods fail.
	- Gradually increase **inflation pressure**.
	- Use a **respiratory function monitor** to check tidal volumes (target 5-8 mL/kg).
	- Continuously assess heart rate and chest movement with a saturation monitor and/or ECG.
- If lung aeration is inadequate and the heart rate remains very slow, confirm **effective ventilation** before starting chest compressions.
### Airway Adjuncts, Assisted Ventilation Devices, PEEP and CPAP

#### Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) & Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)

- For **preterm infants** breathing spontaneously, **CPAP** (via mask or nasal prongs) should be the initial method of breathing support after delivery.
- During positive pressure ventilation (PPV), aim for **PEEP** of 5-6 cm H2O.

#### Assisted Ventilation Devices

- Use a **well-fitted face mask** for an optimal seal.
- Preferably use a **T-piece resuscitator (TPR)** for delivering CPAP or PPV with PEEP.
- **Nasal prongs** can be a viable alternative to a facemask for CPAP.
- If using a **self-inflating bag (SIB)**, ensure the volume is adequate but avoid overinflation. **SIBs cannot deliver CPAP**.

#### Laryngeal Mask

- Consider using a **laryngeal mask** in infants ≥ 34 weeks (~2000g):
	- When facemask ventilation is ineffective.
	- When intubation is not feasible due to anatomical issues, lack of equipment, or lack of skill.
	- As a secondary airway alternative to tracheal intubation.
- Some devices can be used in infants as small as **1500g**.

#### Tracheal Tube

- **Tracheal intubation** may be needed during neonatal resuscitation when:
	- Ventilation is ineffective despite optimizing facemask technique or increasing inspiratory pressure.
	- Prolonged ventilation is needed to secure the airway.
	- Suctioning the lower airways is required for presumed blockage.
	- Chest compressions are required.
	- Special conditions such as **congenital diaphragmatic hernia** or to deliver **surfactant**.
- Confirm proper tube placement with **exhaled CO2 detection**.
- Ensure a range of tracheal tube sizes is available, and use a **video laryngoscope** if needed for intubation.
- Verify tube placement via **radiography** and check ventilation using a **respiratory function monitor** (target expired tidal volume: 5-8 mL/kg).

#### Air/Oxygen

- Use **pulse oximetry** and **oxygen blenders** during resuscitation.
- Aim for oxygen saturation above the **25th percentile** for healthy term infants within the first 5 minutes of life.
- If the heart rate or saturation does not improve, increase the oxygen concentration as needed.
- Regularly check oxygen concentration and saturation, adjusting to avoid both **hypoxia** and **hyperoxia**.
- Wean oxygen when saturation exceeds **95%**.

#### Oxygen Guidelines by Gestation

- **Term and preterm infants ≥ 32 weeks**: Start with **air (21%)**.
- **Preterm infants < 32 weeks**:
	- For 28-31 weeks: **21-30% oxygen**.
	- For < 28 weeks: **30% oxygen**.
- Target oxygen saturation should avoid < 80% or **bradycardia** at 5 minutes in infants < 32 weeks, as both are linked to poor outcomes.
### Chest Compressions

#### Assessment of the Need for Chest Compressions

- If the heart rate is < 60 bpm after 30 seconds of effective ventilation, begin chest compressions.
- Increase oxygen to **100%** and call for experienced help if not already present.

#### Delivery of Chest Compressions

- Use a **3:1 compression-to-ventilation ratio**, with 15 cycles every 30 seconds.
- Apply a **two-handed** compression technique if possible.
- Reassess every 30 seconds and ensure the airway is secured if the heart rate remains low.
- Adjust oxygen concentration based on **preductal oxygen saturation** and consider **vascular access** and **drugs** if necessary.
### Vascular Access

#### Umbilical Venous Access

- **Umbilical vein** provides rapid vascular access and is preferred during resuscitation.
- Use a **closed system** to prevent air embolism.
- Verify correct placement by aspirating blood before administering drugs or fluids.
- A **clean, non-sterile technique** is sufficient in emergencies. Umbilical access may still be possible days after birth in cases of collapse.

#### Intraosseous (IO) Access

- **Intraosseous access** is an alternative for rapid administration of drugs or fluids if venous access is not available.
### Support of Transition/Post-Resuscitation Care

- If venous access is required after resuscitation, **peripheral access** may be sufficient; in some cases, **central access** is needed.
- IO access may be used temporarily when other sites are unavailable.
### Drugs During Active Resuscitation

#### Adrenaline

- If the heart rate remains < 60 bpm despite ventilation and compressions for 30 seconds:
	- **Intravenous** route is preferred; **intraosseous** is an alternative.
	- Dose: 20 mcg/kg (0.2 mL/kg of 1:10,000 adrenaline).
	- If no other access is available, **intra-tracheal** route can be used at 100 mcg/kg.
	- Continue doses every **3-5 minutes** if heart rate remains < 60 bpm.

#### Glucose

- Administer **glucose** in prolonged resuscitation to prevent hypoglycemia.
	- Dose: **250 mg/kg bolus** (2.5 mL/kg of 10% glucose solution).

#### Volume Replacement

- For suspected **blood loss** or shock, administer:
	- **10 mL/kg** of group O Rh-negative blood or isotonic crystalloid.

#### Sodium Bicarbonate

- Consider in prolonged resuscitation to reverse acidosis.
	- Dose: **1-2 mmol/kg** (2-4 mL/kg of 4.2% solution) via slow IV injection.
### Post-Resuscitation Care

- Monitor glucose levels post-resuscitation, aiming to prevent **hypoglycemia** or **hyperglycemia**.
- Maintain infant temperature between **36.5°C and 37.5°C**. Rewarm if hypothermic, unless therapeutic hypothermia is indicated.
- For significant risk of **hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)**, consider **therapeutic hypothermia** (target 33-34°C).
	- Document all clinical evidence (e.g., cord blood gases, neurological examination).
	- Arrange transfer to a facility for ongoing monitoring and care.
### Documentation and Prognosis

- Accurate documentation is essential for:
	- Retrospective evaluation of the infant's clinical state at birth.
	- Recording interventions and responses during resuscitation.
### Communication with Parents

#### Pre-delivery Discussions

- For high-risk cases, involve parents in discussions about the **potential need for resuscitation** and its prognosis before delivery.
- Record these conversations in both the **mother’s and infant’s notes**.

#### Parental Presence During Resuscitation

- It is reasonable for parents to be present during resuscitation if circumstances allow.
- Provide a **support person** for the parents during the process.
- Allow skin-to-skin contact as soon as possible after resuscitation.
### Withholding and Discontinuing Resuscitation

- Decisions should consider **regional/national guidelines** and the dignity of the infant and family.
- Involve **senior staff** when deciding to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment.
- When life support is withdrawn, provide appropriate **palliative care**.
### Discontinuing Resuscitation

- If the heart rate remains undetectable after **10 minutes**, review all factors (gestation, dysmorphic features, effectiveness of resuscitation) before considering cessation.
- If there is no response after **20 minutes**, resuscitation should generally be stopped unless reversible factors are identified.
### Withholding Resuscitation

- Decisions to withhold life-sustaining treatment should be based on discussions with parents, considering outcomes.
- **Resuscitation is not appropriate** where the neonatal mortality rate is extremely high (> 90%) and morbidity in survivors is unacceptable.
- If survival is > 50% and morbidity is acceptable, **resuscitation should be initiated**.
- In uncertain outcomes or when prior discussions were not possible, resuscitation should generally proceed.
