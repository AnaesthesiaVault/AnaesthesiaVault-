# Anaesthesia for Cleft Lip and Palate Surgery

- **Overview**:
	- CLP are common craniofacial abnormalities needing early surgical treatment.
	- Affects appearance, speech, eating, hearing, and social development.
	- Requires a comprehensive team approach with preand post-surgery care.
- **Prevalence**:
	- Global prevalence: Cleft lip (1:300–1,200 live births); Cleft palate (1:2,500 live births).
	- South Africa: Cleft lip (1.4:1,000 in Caucasians, 0.4:1,000 in Africans).
	- More common in males (CLP) and females (isolated CP).
- **Types of Defects**:
![[4859061F-3D98-4691-9F71-535BABA3F392 1.jpeg]]
	- **Cleft Lip (CL)**:
		- Can be unilateral (left side more common) or bilateral.
		- Defect can be complete (extends into nostrils) or incomplete (varies in size).
	- **Cleft Palate (CP)**:
		- Involves soft and/or hard palate.
		- Can be unilateral or bilateral, complete (affects both primary/secondary palate) or incomplete (only secondary palate).
		- CP without CL is a distinct condition.

- **Embryology**:
	- CLP results from palatal growth defects during the first trimester.
	- Clefts of the lip/alveolus detectable by 18–20 week ultrasound; palate clefts are harder to detect before birth.
- **Aetiology**:
	- Multifactorial: Genetic, environmental, and hereditary factors.
	- Associated with teratogens:
		- smoking
		- alcohol
		- drugs:
			- Anticonvulsants:
				- phenytoin
				- benzodiazepines
			- salicylates
		- cortisone.) and
	- Increased paternal age.
- **Associated Syndromes**:
![[550894A7-C81D-4BAD-A05E-A4A01AC618C8 1.jpeg]]
- 22–37% of CLP cases have associated malformations.
- Common syndromes with anaesthetic implications: Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Velocardiofacial syndrome, Foetal alcohol syndrome, Stickler syndrome, Down syndrome, Klippel-Feil syndrome.
- Associated problems include congenital heart disease, chronic airway issues, right ventricular hypertrophy, and difficult intubation/extubation.
- **Timing of Surgical Repair**:
	- **Cleft Lip (CL)**: Typically repaired between 3–6 months; trend towards neonatal surgery.
	- **Cleft Palate (CP)**: Repaired between 3–9 months, possibly up to 18 months; can be primary or staged repair.
	- Further surgeries may be needed for velopharyngeal dysfunction, midface hypoplasia, and maxillary retrusion during adolescence.

**Anaesthesia Considerations for Cleft Lip and Palate Surgery**

- ## Preoperative Assessment:
	- **Syndrome Presence**:
		- Thorough examination to check for associated syndromes and cardiac defects (Echo if murmur detected).
	- **Airway Management**:
		- Most non-syndromic infants are easy to intubate.
		- Difficult intubation factors: bilateral cleft lip, retrognathia, micrognathia, infants < 6 months, left-sided cleft lip/alveolus.
	- **Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)**:
		- Common due to chronic rhinorrhoea from food reflux.
		- Increased postoperative respiratory complications and risk of reactive airways.
	- **Chronic Airway Obstruction**:
		- Look for snoring, apnoea during feeds, chronic hypoxia, right ventricular hypertrophy, cor pulmonale.
		- Sedatives may worsen airway obstruction.
	- **Nutrition and Hydration**:
		- Feeding difficulties can lead to dehydration and malnutrition, possibly delaying surgery.
		- Nutritional/physiological anaemia possible; routine haemoglobin testing not necessary.
	- **Premedication**:
		- Usually not required; avoid sedatives if airway obstruction is a concern.
		- Possible options for children >1 year: oral paracetamol (with/without midazolam), oral ketamine with paracetamol, intranasal dexmedetomidine.
		- Anticholinergics (e.g., atropine, glycopyrrolate) may be used to reduce secretions.
- ## Intraoperative Management:
	- **Induction**:
		- Inhalational induction common; TIVA (remifentanil-propofol) is an alternative.
		- Secure airway with a south-facing oral Rae endotracheal tube; maintain spontaneous ventilation until face mask ventilation is confirmed.
		- Consider muscle relaxants (e.g., suxamethonium or non-depolarising agent) if no intubation difficulties are anticipated.
		- 10% of ASA 1 patients may have difficult laryngoscopy; higher incidence in those with associated syndromes.
	- **Intubation Tips**:
		- Use a straight blade instead of a curved one if needed.
		- Pack large alveolar defects with gauze to prevent laryngoscope blade slippage.
		- Consider lateral approach with a Miller blade for bilateral cleft lip.
		- Have difficult airway equipment ready for syndromic patients.
	- **Precautions**:
		- Insert a throat pack to prevent airway soiling and blood ingestion; remove before emergence.
		- Use a head ring and roll to extend the neck; Boyle-Davis gag for palate repair.
		- Administer antibiotics, corticosteroids (dexamethasone), antiemetics, and appropriate fluids; consider 1% dextrose for hypoglycemia risk.
	- **Surgical Duration and Blood Loss**:
		- Surgery lasts 1–2 hours; blood loss is uncommon, but CP repairs can have significant blood loss.
		- Consider 10 mg/kg tranexamic acid for oozing but may be controversial.
	- **Analgesia**:
		- Multimodal approach essential.
		- Paracetamol (orally or intravenously) and NSAIDs (for infants >6 months, used cautiously postoperatively for CP repairs).
		- Short-acting opioids (e.g., fentanyl) for CL repairs; longer-acting opioids (e.g., morphine) for CP repairs.
		- Regional anaesthesia: Infraorbital nerve blocks for CL repairs; maxillary nerve blocks for CP repairs.
- *_Regional Anaesthesia for Cleft Lip and Palate (CLP) Surgery_
- **Cleft Lip (CL) Repair**:
	- **Infraorbital Nerve Blocks**:
		- Provides up to 19 hours of effective postoperative analgesia without respiratory depression.
		- Superior to peri-incisional infiltration and fentanyl titrations.
		- Blocks sensation to the upper lip, lower eyelid, cheek, and alae nasi.
		- Can be performed bilaterally, either intra-orally or extra-orally.
		- Technique: Small gauge needle placed superficially to the infraorbital foramen, using 0.5–1 ml of 0.25%–0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline.
- **Cleft Palate (CP) Repair**:
	- **Maxillary Nerve Blocks**:
		- Can be performed via intra-oral (blocking palatine nerves), infrazygomatic, or suprazygomatic approaches.
		- Innervates the lower eyelid, upper lip, skin between them, roof of the mouth, and palate.
		- Blocks should be supplemented with other analgesic modalities as there is no single effective block for CLP surgeries.
		- Reduces opioid requirements effectively.

	**Extubation**:
	- Ensure throat pack removal (included in swab count per WHO checklist).
	- Inspect oropharynx for blood clots and haemostasis; minimal suctioning to avoid disrupting repairs.
	- Antagonise muscle relaxants if used; extubate when fully awake with protective reflexes intact.
## Postoperative Management for Cleft Lip and Palate (CLP) Surgery**
- **Postoperative Morbidity**:
	- 15-20% of CLP repairs have associated morbidity.
	- 2% risk of reoperation due to bleeding and airway obstruction.
- **Monitoring**:
	- All children should be monitored in the recovery room until fully awake, pain is controlled, and no signs of bleeding are present.
- **Airway Obstruction**:
	- **Timing**:
		- Most common immediately post-op but can occur within 12–48 hours.
		- Massive tongue swelling usually presents within 90 minutes post-surgery.
	- **Risk Factors**:
		- Preoperative airway concerns, congenital abnormalities (e.g., Pierre Robin sequence), micrognathia.
	- **Causes**:
		- Congenital abnormalities associated with micrognathia
		- Anaesthetic or surgical complications
			- tongue swelling
				- Mouth held open by Boyle-Davis gag
					- Exerts pressure on the alveolar ridge and tongue.
					- Mucosal oedema results if too much pressure is applied for a prolonged period or the incorrect size retractor blade is used.
						- impaired venous and lymphatic drainage, and is worsened by neck overextension and if steep Trendelenburg is used.
					- The BoylesDavis gag should be released for 5–10 minutes every hour especially during prolonged surgery. Upon removal of the gag inspect the whole oropharynx and base of the tongue.
					- Should the tongue appear swollen or dusky in colour, decide whether extubation is appropriate and consider placing a NPA.
					- The child should be closely observed in a high care environment or placed in ICU ventilated until the swelling has resolved.
			- retained throat pack
			- bleeding, laryngospasm
			- residual effects of anaesthetic agents
				- leads to reduction in pharyngeal tone
			- inadequate mouth opening
			- opioid-induced respiratory depression
			- laryngeal oedema).
	- **Management**:
		- **Simple Maneuvers**:
			- Position child left lateral or prone, pull tongue forward, consider tongue suture, provide CPAP if needed, avoid oropharyngeal airway unless necessary.
		- **Other Airway Devices**:
			- Use NPA or LMA if needed.
		- **Re-intubation**:
			- Required if simple maneuvers fail; consider fibre optic scope, and be prepared for a surgical airway in severe cases.
			- Anticipate difficult intubation due to postoperative swelling and bleeding.
		- **Monitoring**:
			- High-dependency unit monitoring recommended for all patients, ICU monitoring for high-risk patients or those with complications.
- **Postoperative Analgesia**:
	- Continue multimodal analgesic strategies:
		- Regular paracetamol and NSAIDs (for infants >6 months).
		- Oral tilidine (1 mg/kg) or IV opioids (morphine 0.05–0.1 mg/kg) for selected cases, provided no airway obstruction.
		- Consider rectal analgesics if needed.
	- Nerve block performed intraoperatively continues to provide analgesia postoperatively.
	- IV fluids may be necessary until oral intake is re-established, especially in infants reluctant to swallow post-repair.
