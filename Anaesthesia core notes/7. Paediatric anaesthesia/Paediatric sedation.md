- **Monitoring:** Pulse oximetry, ECG - continuous, BP every 3-5 minutes, ± EtCO2, precordial stethoscope
## Explained
- Sedation is a continuum of the awake state.
### Minimal Sedation (formerly Known as anxiolysis)
- Drug-induced state during which patients respond normally to verbal commands.
- Although cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, respiratory and cardiovascular stability is unimpaired.
### Moderate Sedation (formerly Known as Conscious sedation)
- Drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation.
- It is important to remember that reflex response to a painful stimulus is not a purposeful response.
- No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation is adequate.
- Cardiovascular stability is usually maintained.
### Deep sedation/analgesia
- Drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot be easily roused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulus.
- Patients may require assistance in maintaining a patent airway and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. Cardiovascular stability is usually maintained.
- In the UK deep sedation is considered to be a part of the spectrum of general anaesthesia.
# Goals
- Guard the patient’s safety and welfare
- Minimize physical discomfort and pain
- Control anxiety, minimize psychological trauma and maximize the potential for amnesia
- Control behaviour and/or movement to allow the safe completion of the procedure
- Return the patient to a state in which safe discharge from medical supervision is possible
# Contra-indications
## Absolute
- Abnormal airway including adenotonsillar hypertrophy causing obstruction to breathing when asleep (Obstructive Sleep Apnoea, or OSA), or any other anatomical abnormality of upper and lower airway.
- Raised intracranial pressure
- Depressed conscious level.
- History of sleep apnoea
- Respiratory failure
- Cardiac failure
- Neuromuscular disease
- Bowel obstruction
- Active respiratory tract infection
- Known allergy to sedative drug / previous adverse reaction
- Child too distressed despite adequate preparation
- Older child with severe behavioural problems
- Refusal by the parent / guardian / child.
## Relative

 Neonates, especially if premature or ex-premature

 - Children with cardiovascular instability or impaired cardiac function
 - Renal impairment
 - Hepatic impairment
 - Severe respiratory disease
 - Gastro-oesophageal reflux
 - Impaired bulbar reflexes
 - Emergency cases who are not adequately starved
 - Anticonvulsant therapy
 - Children receiving opioids and other sedatives
 - Children receiving drugs that potentiate the action of sedatives (e.g. macrolide antibiotics like erythromycin potentiate and prolong the sedative effects of midazolam)
# Patient Preparation
- Minimum Fasting Period NB
### SOAP Preparation for Procedures
- **S (Suction):** Size-appropriate suction catheters and a functioning suction apparatus (e.g., Yankauer-type suction)
- **O (Oxygen):** Adequate oxygen supply and functioning flow meters/other devices to allow its delivery
- **A (Airway):** Size-appropriate airway equipment (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal airways, laryngoscope blades [checked and functioning], tracheal tubes, stylets, face mask, bag-valve-mask or equivalent device [functioning])
- **P (Pharmacy):** All the basic drugs needed to support life during an emergency, including antagonists as indicated
- **M (Monitors):** Functioning pulse oximeter with size appropriate oximeter probes and other monitors as appropriate for the procedure (e.g., non-invasive blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide, ECG, stethoscope)
- **E (Equipment):** Special equipment or drugs for a particular case (e.g., defibrillator)
# Drugs
## Benzodiazepines
### Midazolam
- Anxiolysis, sedation and amnesia
- Oral: 0.5 mg/kg (maximum 20 mg, 30 min beforehand) reduces crying during induction of anaesthesia, but occasionally dizziness, dysphoria and paradoxical reactions occur. Its bitter taste needs masking with a sweetening agent.
- Intranasal drops or sublingual 0.2 mg/kg
- Rectally: 0.3–1 mg/kg
- IV titration: 0.05–0.2 mg/kg
#### Reversal
- Flumazenil 20-30ug/kg
## Barbiturates
### Propofol
- Sedation is induced by 2–4 mg/kg and usually maintained by an infusion of 6–8 mg/kg/h
## Opioids
### Morphine
- Useful for painful procedures such as wound care. A dose of 60 microgram/kg i.v. has been used in combination with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg i.v. without major respiratory effects
### Fentanyl
- 1–6 microgram/kg
#### Reversal
- Nalaxone: 10 microgram/kg i.v, repeated as necessary
## Tranquillizers
### Trimeprazine
- 3–4 mg/kg orally
- Because of reports of hypotension, the maximum recommended dose is 2 mg/kg. At this dose, it can be combined with morphine 0.2 mg/kg i.m. for sedation of children >15 kg for MRI
### Chlorpromazine and Promethazine
### Nitrous Oxide Nitrous Oxide
- Provides valuable analgesia and sedation in cooperative children for a wide variety of painful procedures.
- Loss of consciousness can occur when combined with other sedatives or when used alone in concentrations over 50%
### Ketamine
- IMI: 4mg/kg
- Oral: 5mg-10/kg (wait 10-20min). Can take 2 hours to recover
- IVI: 0.15-0.2mg/kg
# Associated Procedures
## Scopes

### Pre-op
**History:**
- Nutritional status,
- Symptoms of reflux
- Current medications. Patients on regular steroids will usually require a dose of hydrocortisone at induction. Those on immunosuppressant drugs are at risk of neutropenia; where this is the case, consider if the procedure is still in their best interests, and, if so, then antibiotic prophylaxis may be indicated. Antibiotics may also be indicated in patients who have an indwelling central venous catheter (e.g. a peripherally inserted central catheter or Hickman line), as there is a risk of bacterial translocation.
**Examination:**
- Children having bowel preparation not infrequently vomit and have diarrhoea.
- Look for evidence of dehydration.
- Those most at risk should have been given i.v. fluids as a preventative measure, but some children may require initiation of, or additional, fluid therapy before anaesthesia.
**Investigations:**
- Immunosuppressant drugs, those on PN, those at risk of electrolyte disturbance (particularly renal, cardiac, or endocrine patients), and those having more aggressive bowel preparation regimens. Children having Klean-Prep (macrogol 3350) or similar have a 15% incidence of hypokalaemia
### Technique
- A technique in which spontaneous ventilation is maintained may be preferred by the endoscopist, as some find that abdominal muscle tone can help guide the endoscope during colonoscopy; this can be particularly helpful in children with constipation, as the colon can be large and floppy
#### IV Sedation
- Combination of midazolam and fentanyl (or similar opioid) for a colonoscopy
- A retrospective review of more than 10 000 OGDs in children in the USA found that, when compared with general anaesthesia, i.v. sedation was independently associated with a fivefold risk of a cardiopulmonary complication.
#### LMA
- It is possible to perform an OGD with a laryngeal mask in situ, and this is the usual practice in some departments.
- A standard i-gel® (Intersurgical, Wokingham, UK) works well for this, although a smaller size than normal will usually be required
#### Native Airway Technique
- Anaesthesia with spontaneous breathing, but without an airway adjunct can be achieved in selected patients using TIVA with propofol.
- Oxygen is delivered via nasal cannulae that have an integral sampling port, so allowing for capnography.
- TIVA can be used for induction of anaesthesia or started after a gaseous induction. [[Peadiatric TIVA]]
- Adjuncts that can be used to facilitate the native airway technique include opioids (typically remifentanil, alfentanil, or fentanyl), local anaesthetic throat spray, or i.v. lidocaine
- *The main problem* with this technique is the risk of either apnoea or laryngospasm. Reasons include the potent stimulus of the procedure, whilst the application of 100% oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure is impossible. Close coordination with the endoscopist is important to ensure the procedure does not start until an appropriate depth of anaesthesia has been achieved. The endoscopist must also be ready to remove the endoscope rapidly if required in the event of apnoea, laryngospasm, or oxygen desaturation. Lateral positioning improves airway patency and may reduce the triggering of laryngospasm by secretions
#### Intubation
##### Indications for Intubation

(a) A patient weighing <10 kg or aged less than 1 yr

(b) Difficult airway or known airway problems, including snoring/obstructive sleep apnoea

(c) Significant cardiac or respiratory co-morbidity

(d) GI conditions that increase the risk of aspiration (e.g. significant Gourd, CIPO, oesophageal stricture, or achalasia; the last two can both result in food residue being retained above the level of obstruction)

(e) Specific procedures, such as PEG insertion/removal/ change or enteroscopy

##### How
- No need NMB
- Effective methods include giving propofol, alfentanil, or remifentanil after a gaseous induction, or using an i.v. induction with propofol in combination with either remifentanil or alfentanil.
### Post Procedure
- Gentle pressure on the abdomen at the end of the procedure can help the expulsion of some of the gas before extubation of the trachea
# SASSA Guideline 2021 Summary

The guideline document "SASA Paediatric Guidelines for the Safe Use of Procedural Sedation and Analgesia for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures in Children (2021–2026)" provides comprehensive recommendations for ensuring the safety of children undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA).

### 1. **Introduction**
- **Sedation as an alternative to general anaesthesia**: Sedation is valuable in facilitating both painful and non-painful procedures outside of a hospital operating room, such as in clinics or physician offices.
- **Objective**: The guidelines aim to provide sedation practitioners with a framework to ensure the safety and efficacy of sedation in paediatric patients. However, these are not meant to replace clinical training.
- **Exclusions**: The guidelines do not cover children requiring intensive care sedation, sedation for palliative care, home settings, or premedication for general anaesthesia (GA).
### 2. **Definitions**
- **Sedation continuum**: Sedation ranges from minimal sedation (anxiolysis) to deep sedation, and eventually to general anaesthesia. The sedation level can deepen with increased drug dosage or combinations.
- **Non-dissociative vs. dissociative sedation**: Non-dissociative agents (like benzodiazepines) work along a sedation continuum, while dissociative sedation (like ketamine) results in a trance-like state where airway reflexes and breathing are maintained.
### 3. **Environment And Clinical Setting**
- Safe sedation can be performed outside hospital operating theatres, but requires proper facilities, equipment, and trained personnel. The sedation team must be equipped for emergencies, with access to an intensive care setting if necessary.
### 4. **Valid Informed Consent**
- **Consent process**: The guidelines emphasize obtaining informed consent well in advance of the procedure. Both the sedation and the procedure should be discussed with the child’s parents or caregivers.
- **Children's autonomy**: Children older than 12 years may consent to medical treatment if they are mature enough to understand the risks and implications.
### 5. **Patient Assessment**
- **Assessment requirements**: It is vital to assess the child’s medical history, medication use, and airway before sedation. Children with complex conditions or histories may require sedation in a hospital setting.
- **Risk factors**: Children younger than three, those with comorbidities like obesity or syndromes, and children with prior failed sedation attempts are at increased risk and may require special consideration.
### 6. **Fasting Guidelines**
- **Basic sedation**: For minimal sedation techniques, fasting is recommended but not mandatory. For deeper sedation or advanced techniques, standard fasting times (clear fluids: 2 hours, breast milk: 4 hours, solid food: 6 hours) should be observed.
### 7. **Standards Of Monitoring**
- **Monitoring levels**: Depending on the sedation depth, clinical and electronic monitoring are essential. Monitoring includes heart rate, oxygen saturation, airway patency, respiratory rate, and consciousness levels.
- **Capnography**: While not mandatory for minimal sedation, capnography is recommended for moderate to deep sedation, particularly in patients with respiratory issues, obesity, or during prolonged procedures.
### 8. **Personnel**
- **Roles**: Sedation should involve at least two individuals (the operator and a trained observer), and for advanced techniques, a third dedicated sedation practitioner is recommended.
- **Training**: Practitioners must have formal training in paediatric sedation and airway management, and maintain certification in life support (PALS/APLS).
### 9. **Documentation**
- Proper documentation before, during, and after sedation is crucial for ensuring safety and accountability. This includes pre-sedation evaluations, sedation monitoring flow charts, and discharge criteria.
### 10. **Safe Sedation Practice**
- **Safety principles**: Safe sedation practices depend on patient selection, practitioner competency, and an appropriate environment. Special care is needed for groups like obese children, those with trisomy 21, or those with cerebral palsy.
- **Recovery and discharge**: Children must be monitored until they recover fully from the sedation, with specific discharge criteria and follow-up processes in place.
### 11. **Drugs Used in PSA**
- The guidelines detail a wide range of sedatives (e.g., benzodiazepines, ketamine, propofol) and analgesics (e.g., opioids, nitrous oxide) for use in PSA, alongside information on their indications, dosing, and potential adverse effects.
