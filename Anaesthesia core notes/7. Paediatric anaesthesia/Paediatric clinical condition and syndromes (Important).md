## Cerebral Palsy

### Introduction

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311154756.png)

- A disorder of movement & posture due to a static encephalopathy
- Huge spectrum of presentation: almost asymptomatic to completely dependent
- Caused by a cerebral insult in the immature brain that occurred prenatally, perinatally, or during infancy
- The motor deficit may manifest as: Hypotonia, Spasticity, Extrapyramidal features such as choreoathetoid/dystonic movements or ataxia
![](Pasted%20image%2020240311154705.png)
### Considerations
- ↓ C-spine mobility & possible difficult intubation
- Aspiration risk (GERD/↓lower esophageal sphincter tone)
- **Pulmonary/ CVS** Recurrent aspiration & pulmonary impairment Scoliosis & ↑ bleeding risk during scoliosis surgery; Rule out pulmonary HTN/RV failure
- **CNS:** Developmental delay/lack of cooperation; Seizure d/o; Hydrocephalus
- **Altered response to anesthetics:** ↓ MAC of volatiles & longer emergence; ↑ resistance to muscle relaxants; Volatiles & succinylcholine NOT contraindicated
- Difficult IV access, monitoring, & positioning due to contractures
- Ex-premature conditions
- ↑ risk of hypothermia
## Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD)

### Background
- BPD is a clinical diagnosis defined as O2 dependence at 36 weeks' postconceptual age or O2 requirement (to maintain PaO2 > 50 mm Hg) beyond 28 days of life in infants with birth weights of less than 1500 g
- Most significant symptoms in 1st year of life, many with mild disease become asymptomatic but reactive airways may remain
### Considerations
- **Pulmonary dysfunction**: Hypoxemia & hypercarbia; Hyperinflation & bullae; Reactive airways disease
- **CVS:** Associated pulmonary hypertension, RV dysfunction & risk of perioperative pulmonary hypertension crisis/RV failure
- **Post-op disposition & pain management**: Maximize ventilatory function to decrease complications
- Regional, neuraxial & adjuncts whenever possible
- - **Management of medications:** Diuretics; Stress dose steroid if on chronic steroids
#### Former Premature Infant with Possible Previous Intubation
- **Airway:** subglottic stenosis, tracheomalacia/bronchomalacia
- **CNS**: seizures, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy
- **Cardiovascular:** PDA, cardiomyopathies
- **GI:** GERD, malnutrition, swallowing problems (risk of aspiration)
### Optimization/ Management
- Treat & optimize any acute respiratory decompensation
- Regional if possible
- If GA: Deep anaesthesia, Ventilatory settings as asthma (longer expiratory time, slow-normal RR), Consider LMA to avoid tracheal stimulation  
- Avoid ↑ PVR: Avoid hypoxia, hypercapnia (although mild hypercapnia is ok given they have obstructive pattern), acidosis, sympathetic surges, ↑ airway pressures, hypothermia

## Down Syndrome

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311161135.png)

### Considerations
- Potential for atlanto-axial (AAI) or atlanto-occipital instability & neurologic injury with neck manipulation
- **Potential for difficult bag mask ventilation (but not usually intubation):** Large tongue,↑ oropharyngeal soft tissue, small mouth, subglottic stenosis, high arched palate
- Tonsillar & adenoid hypertrophy
-**Obstructive sleep apnea:** Pulmonary hypertension/RV dysfunction
- Sensitive to sedatives/hypnotics
- Developmental delay/cooperation problems
- **Associated congenital heart disease (up to 50%):** Cushion defect (AVSD) = VSD, ASD, TOF; Pulmonary hypertension
#### Other Medical Issues
- Obesity
- Accelerated coronary disease & valvulopathy (MVP, AI)
- Hypothyroidism
- **GI:** duodenal atresia or stenosis, TEF, Hirschsprungs, celiac disease
- **Heme:** polycythemia, leukemia, immune deficiency
- Joint laxity (careful with positioning)
- Early Alzheimer’s dementia
### Goals
- **Rule out & manage AAI**: neurologic exam/history & flexion-extension views of c-spine
- Airway adjuncts such as a video laryngoscope
- Skin topicalization for IV start
- Sedation (midazolam may be paradoxical)
- Arrange post-op monitoring
- Overnight oximetry useful
### Conflicts
- **Unstable C-spine vs uncooperative patient with developmental delay**: Consider IM/PO sedation to facilitate IV placement; Ketamine 5 mg/kg IM, 7 mg/kg PO; Midazolam 0.5 mg/kg PO (max dose 20 mg)
- Inhalational induction may be problematic in an adult with DS due to obesity, OSA, uncooperative nature
## Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

### Background
- X-linked recessive degenerative disease of skeletal & smooth muscle that usually first manifests in males of 2-5 years of age
- Becker muscle dystrophy is essentially a milder form of Duchenne
### Considerations
- Possible difficult airway if macroglossia
- **Aspiration risk:** bulbar weakness, ↓ gastric motility
- **Succinylcholine/volatile anesthetics contraindicated** due to rhabdomyolysis/hyperkalemia risk, use total IV anesthesia​
- **Pulmonary:** Possible obstructive sleep apnea; Sensitivity to sedatives/hypnotics; Pulmonary hypertension/RV failure; Restrictive lung disease from scoliosis & respiratory muscle weakness; Risk of perioperative respiratory failure; Impaired cough reflex (atelectasis, recurrent aspirations)
- **Cardiovascular:** Dilated cardiomyopathy; Tall R waves in precordial leads, ↑ R:S, deep Q in I, aVL, V5-6; Mitral regurgitation common (due to papillary muscle involvement from LV dilation); Conduction defects & arrhythmias common (atrial, SVT, AV nodal)
- **CNS:** mild cognitive impairment is common
- **Medications**: ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, steroids (may need stress dose)
### Conflicts
- RSI vs. succinylcholine
- Prolonged postoperative ventilation
- Advanced directive discussions
# Surgical
## Cleft Lip & Palate

### Considerations
- **Potential difficult airway (especially bag mask ventilation):** Careful airway plan required; Ensure direct laryngoscope does not enter cleft!
- **Swallowing dysfunction:** Lung soiling, restrictive lung disease; Malnutrition
- **Associated craniofacial disorders/congenital diseases:** Pierre-Robin; Cogenital heart disease in 20%
- **Post-op airway complications**: Laryngospasm; Edema/obstruction (surgery makes airway management more difficult)
### Goals
- Assess airway for bag mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, & establish sequential airway plan
- Evaluate for congenital heart disease & other congenital abnormalities
- Safe post-op airway management
## Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia

### Background
- Diaphragmatic hernia with intestinal contents in chest
- 90% left sided
- Lung will be underdeveloped & newborn could have persistent pulmonary hypertension
- Delayed surgery is preferred to stabilize prior to closure
- Conventional ventilation with permissive hypercapnia is now favoured
- Other therapies: Surfactant; High-frequency oscillatory ventilation, in addition to nitric oxide
### Considerations
- Emergency situation; critically ill neonate
- **Hypoplastic lungs:** Respiratory insufficiency (hypoxemia, hypercarbia, acidosis); Permissive hypercarbia may be required; Consider HVO or ECMO
- **Pulmonary hypertension:** Potential for RV failure/↓ cardiac output; Consider inhaled nitric oxide
- **Transitional circulation:** Potential for R→L & L→R shunting; PDA
- Delayed surgical repair, resuscitation is first priority
- NICU required
#### Resuscitation
- Call NICU
- Indication for immediate intubation (no bag mask ventilation)
- NG to decompress stomach
- ABG, chest x-ray, echocardiogram
- Umblical artery/vein lines
- **Lung protective ventilation strategy:** Target SaO2 > 85% & permissive hypercapnia (PaCO2 <65 mmHg, pH >7.25); PCV or PSV PIP < 25 cmH2O; Inspiratory time 0.35 s; PEEP 3-5 mmHg; RR < 65. Consider HVO, iNO or ECMO
- **Pulmonary hypertension**: Consider inhaled nitric oxide; Inotropes
- **Fluid:** target MAP 45-50 mmHg
- **Sedation:** opioids & benzodiazepines, thoracic epidural
- Avoid NMB

## Fontan Physiology

![](Pasted%20image%2020240312124008.png)

### Background
- Fontan is a palliative procedure for patients with functional univentricular physiology
- **Selection criteria for performance of Fontan are:** adequately sized pulmonary arteries; low PVR; good LV function & the presence of sinus rhythm
- **The driving force for blood flow through the pulmonary circulation is the difference between central venous pressure (CVP) & atrial pressure**: There is NOT active pumping of blood through the lungs; Cardiac output is essentially completely dependent on pulmonary blood flow; Hypovolemia is tolerated very poorly
- **Preoperative preparation:**
- Review information from patient’s cardiologist; changes in patient’s exercise tolerance, level of cardiac impairment, details of the patient’s physiology, anatomy, & any residual & sequelae of previous surgeries
- Minimize NPO interval, maintain intravascular volume (↓ preload results in ↓ pulmonary blood flow & cardiac output)
### Key Considerations
- Congenital heart disease patient with altered cardiac anatomy & potentially other congenital anomalies
- Hemodymanic & ventilatory goals of Fontan circulation (see below)
- High risk cardiac patient
- Consider surgery at tertiary cardiac centre
- Consultation with cardiology
- Perioperative TEE invaluable
- **Single ventricle pathophysiology:** Venous congestion (causing protein losing enteropathy, CKD, hepatic failure, FTT); Arrhythmias, embolic stroke, anticoagulation; LV dysfunction; Hyypoxemia & hyperviscosity
- **Medication management** (possible beta blockers, ACEI, anticoagulants, diuretics)
- Consideration of bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis if applicable
- Possible ↑ risk of bleeding
- Postoperative monitoring in HAU/ICU
### Goals
#### Hemodynamic Goals
**Preload:** keep full, avoid dehydration
**Rate & rhythm**: strict normal sinus rhythm
**Contractility**: maintain
**Afterload:** maintain
**Pulmonary vascular resistance**: keep low; Avoid hypercarbia, hypoxemia, acidosis, stress, pain, high intrathoracic pressures
#### Fluid Management
- Guided by CVP or TEE (TEE very useful)  
- Vascular capacitance is ↑ in the Fontan patient; more fluid may be required than anticipated based on the formula commonly used to calculate fluid requirement
#### Ventilatory Strategy
- Spontaneous ventilation is best as it enhances venous return & pulmonary blood flow
- **For PPV**: Limit peak inspiratory pressure (<20 cmH2O), use low respiratory rates (<20 bpm), short inspiratory times, avoid excessive positive end-expiratory pressure, moderately elevated tidal volumes (10–15 mL/kg), ensure adequate intravascular volume
#### Postoperative Concerns
- Maintaining volume status, acid-base balance, & cardiac output are essential in the postoperative period; ensure adequate hydration & aggressively manage low cardiac output with intravenous hydration & inotropes
- Adequate analgesia improves pulmonary mechanics & oxygenation; enhanced vigilance is required to avoid the effects of hypercapnia secondary to opioids
- Treat postoperative nausea & vomiting to permit adequate hydration, prevent dehydration & electrolyte loss, & allow the patient to resume their medication regimen
### Pregnancy Considerations
- Titrated epidural is probably the safest technique as it does not worsen PVR; caution with reduction in preload so ensure well-hydrated; reduction in afterload is probably desirable
- Labor is NOT contraindicated but needs to occur in a cardiac centre with invasive monitoring (arterial line) & with assisted 2nd stage
- If cesarean section: best to use epidural technique
- If GA required, use strategies mentioned above
### Laparoscopy & Fontan
- Detailed discussion with surgeon ahead of time
- Minimize insufflation pressures or do staged insufflation & see effects
- Avoid high intrathoracic pressures, reduced preload, & hypercarbia
- If cannot tolerate, may need an open technique
## Prader-Willi

### Genetic Basis
- **Maternal Uniparental Disomy**: Inheriting two copies of maternal chromosome 15.
- **Deletion of Critical Region on Paternal Chromosome**: Loss of paternal copy of 15q11.2-13.
### Hypothalamic Involvement
- Disruption of the hypothalamus due to genetic alterations leads to Prader-Willi Syndrome.
### Hormonal and Growth Effects
- **Growth Hormone Dynamics**: Decreased growth-hormone-releasing hormone production leading to reduced growth hormone secretion, manifesting as short stature.
- **Gonadal Function**:
	- Central hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, primary gonadal defect, or mixed.
	- Abnormal sex hormones: Variations in LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), and inhibin B.
	- Gonadal hypoplasia, micropenis, and delayed puberty resulting in infertility.
	- Decreased bone mineral density and increased risk of osteoporosis and skeletal fractures
### Metabolic and Physiological Effects
- **Central Hypotonia**: Persistently low muscle tone affecting muscle mass and resting metabolic rate.
- **Feeding and Growth in Infancy**:
	- Early-life poor suckling and lethargy.
	- Neonatal and infantile failure to thrive.
- **Appetite Regulation**: Elevated levels of ghrelin lead to hyperphagia (excessive eating).

### Obesity and Associated Risks
- Obesity, a major clinical finding, leads to secondary conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, sleep apnea, and cor pulmonale.
### Characteristic Physical Features
- Facial features include a turned down mouth, narrow bifrontal diameter, narrow nasal bridge, and almond-shaped palpebral fissures.
### Behavioral and Intellectual Impact
- Behavioral issues and intellectual disabilities are common among affected individuals.
### Notes

- Loss of maternal copy of 15q11.2-13 results in Angelman syndrome, a different genetic disorder with its own set of symptoms and characteristics.
- Central hypotonia persists throughout life in individuals with Prader-Willi Syndrome.
- The underlying mechanisms of many of these symptoms are still under research, and not all individuals with Prader-Willi Syndrome have growth hormone deficiency.
