# Preoperative Visit (Paediatrics)
## General

- Build rapport and trust with both the child and the parent.
- Address the child first, then involve the parents in the discussion.
- Address any fears or concerns from both the child and parents.
- Explain the planned approach to induction so both the child and parents know what to expect.
- **Anxiety** is prevalent in up to 80% of children presenting for surgery.
- **Measurements**: Every child should have their height, weight, and appropriate observations (heart rate, oxygen saturations, temperature, and blood pressure) measured, especially in children over 3 years old.
- **Physical Examination**: Include potential intravenous access sites and auscultation of the chest to detect undiagnosed heart murmurs, even in well children.
## History and Examination

**Criteria Requiring Face-to-Face Assessment**
- Preterm infants less than 60 weeks post-conceptual age
- Potential difficult airway
- Poorly controlled chronic illness (e.g., asthma)
- Kidney or liver disease
- Cardiac disease (including a new heart murmur)
- Genetic disorder
- Diabetes mellitus or metabolic disease
- Learning difficulties or autism
- Haemoglobinopathy, anaemia, or clotting problem
- Hypertension requiring treatment
- Safeguarding concerns or children requiring consent by social services
- Previous history or family history of problem with anaesthesia
- Complex physical disability
- Requires any investigations (e.g., blood tests and swabs)
- Request from the patient or carer
### History

- **Previous anaesthetic problems**, including family history.
- **Allergies** and any previous medical problems, including **congenital anomalies**.
- **Recent respiratory illness** or current medications.
- **Recent immunisations**.
- **Fasting times**.
- **Presence of loose teeth**.
- Discuss **post-operative pain management**. If suppositories are to be used, obtain consent from the parents, and the child if appropriate.
### Examination

- Perform a physical examination, focusing on the **airway** and **cardiorespiratory systems**.
- **Weigh the child** (as all drug doses are weight-based). Weight estimation (less accurate over 10 years):
  - (age + 4) x 2 = weight in kg.
#### Predictors of a Difficult Airway in Children
- Age <1 year.
- Weight <10 kg.
- Syndromic appearance.
- Retrognathia.
- Snoring.
### Investigations

- **Haemoglobin**: If large blood loss is expected, in premature infants, systemic disease, or congenital heart disease.
- **Electrolytes**: If renal/metabolic disease, IV fluids are needed, or dehydration is suspected.
- **CXR**: Active respiratory disease, scoliosis, or congenital heart disease.
### Investigations at Preoperative Assessment for Different ASA Classifications

### Fasting Guidelines

- **6 hours** for solids and milk if >12 months.
- **4 hours** for breast milk and formula feeds if <12 months.
- **2 hours** for clear fluids (helps reduce gastric acidity and volume).
- Long fasting periods increase the risk of **nausea and vomiting**.
### Premedication

- **Paracetamol**, **ibuprofen**, or **codeine phosphate** should be administered more than 30 minutes preoperatively.
- **EMLA** or **amethocaine cream**: Applied to veins if intravenous induction is planned.
- **Midazolam**: 0.5 mg/kg (max 15 mg) orally, 15-30 minutes preoperatively. Has variable effects, may produce unpleasant excitatory phases. Sweeteners may be necessary for better tolerance.
- **Ketamine**: 3-8 mg/kg orally, 30-60 minutes preoperatively.
# Anxiety Management in Paediatrics

## Behavioural Interventions

- **Videos**, **clini-clowns**, and **family-centred preparation programmes** can help reduce anxiety.
- Challenges: These methods are **time-consuming** and **costly**.
## Parents Present at Induction

- Controversial approach. **Calm parents** may reduce anxiety, but **anxious parents** can have the opposite effect.
## Sedative Premedication

- **Midazolam**: Can have prolonged effects and paradoxical reactions.
- **Clonidine**: Offers **analgesia** and **anaesthesia-sparing properties**; preoperative **hypotension** and **bradycardia** can occur but are usually not clinically significant.
- **Dexmedetomidine**: 2-4 mcg/kg intranasally.
- **Ketamine**: Can increase secretions and cause **emergence delirium**.
# Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) Considerations

## URTI Scheduling

- **Proceed**: If there is a **clear runny nose**, **dry cough**, or the procedure is minor.
- **Cancel**: If the child is <1 year old or has:
  - Purulent nasal discharge.
  - Productive cough.
  - Wheezing or crepitations.
  - Systemic symptoms (fever >38°C, malaise, feeding problems, headache).
  - Parental confirmation that the child is unwell.
## Factors Increasing Risk

- Parental smoking.
- Asthma.
- Airway anomalies.
- Prematurity.
- Snoring history.
- Airway procedures.
- Inexperienced anaesthetist.
- Tracheal intubation.
## Management if Proceeding with Surgery (Adults and Paediatrics)

- Consider administering **bronchodilators** 10-30 minutes before surgery to reduce bronchoconstriction (evidence is mixed).
- **Avoid tracheal intubation** if possible.
- Use **laryngeal spray** with caution, as it may trigger laryngospasm, particularly if the depth of anaesthesia is inadequate.
- **Propofol IV** is preferable to sevoflurane for induction, as it reduces the incidence of post-anaesthetic respiratory events (PRAE).
- Apply **vasoconstrictor nose drops** and perform **nasal suctioning**.
- Ensure appropriate depth of anaesthesia to avoid **bronchospasm**.
- **Suction** while the patient is deeply anaesthetised at the end of surgery.
- Whether to perform **deep or awake intubation** remains inconclusive in evidence.
- Maintain **self-protection** and prevent the spread of infection.
# Specific Conditions
## Respiratory
### Asthma

- **Risk Factors for Perioperative Respiratory Adverse Events (PRAEs):**
	1. Respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks.
	2. Previous exacerbation under anaesthesia.
	3. Moderate or severe asthma.
	4. Previous artificial ventilation for acute asthma.
	5. Age under 5 years.
- **Management:**
	- Review the latest respiratory clinic letter and asthma management plan.
	- Utilize the asthma control test and consider referral to the asthma team or general practitioner if control is poor.
	- Defer elective surgery if asthma control is suboptimal.
	- Continue asthma medications as usual before surgery; short courses of oral corticosteroids might be beneficial.
	- Consider preoperative antibiotics for children with recurrent infections and provide smoking cessation advice for household members.
### Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Children

#### Overview

Sleep-disordered breathing encompasses a range of disorders from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). OSA severity is classified based on the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) as measured by polysomnography:

- **Mild OSA:** AHI < 5 events per hour
- **Moderate OSA:** AHI 5–10 events per hour
- **Severe OSA:** AHI > 10 events per hour

#### Common Causes and Peak Diagnosis Age
- **Primary Cause:** Adenotonsillar hypertrophy
- **Peak Age for Diagnosis:** 2–6 years
- **Other Causes:** Chromosomal abnormalities, craniofacial syndromes, cerebral palsy, neuromuscular disorders, obesity

#### Treatment
- **Mainstay for Moderate-to-Severe OSA:** Adenotonsillectomy

#### Diagnosis
- **Primary Method:** Clinical assessment, including history of snoring and witnessed apnoea, typically three or more nights per week, alongside behavioral symptoms.
- **Gold Standard Test:** Polysomnography, reserved for cases with diagnostic uncertainty.
- **Alternative Test:** Overnight pulse oximetry, less reliable and a poor predictor of postoperative respiratory adverse events (PRAEs).
- **Additional Assessment:** Echocardiogram for signs of right ventricular dysfunction or severe desaturation (<70% on polysomnography).

#### Risk Factors and Perioperative Planning

Obstructive sleep apnoea is an independent risk factor for PRAEs. Important considerations include:

- **Age:** <3 years
- **Weight:** Above the 99.6th or below the 0.4th BMI percentile
- **Severity of OSA:** Severe classification
- **Comorbidities:** Cardiac complications, craniofacial abnormalities, cerebral palsy, neuromuscular disorders, mucopolysaccharidosis, achondroplasia, etc.

#### Management Protocols in the UK
- **General Guidance:** Children >2 years old and >12 kg without additional risk factors can be treated in secondary centers.
- **Children <3 Years or <2 Years with Additional Risks:** Should be managed at centers with appropriate critical care facilities.
- **Perioperative Risk Stratification:** Requires multidisciplinary planning.

### Cystic Fibrosis

#### Perioperative Management
- **Involvement of CF Team:** Essential for all stages of perioperative care.
- **Assessment Focus:** Disease severity, functional status, glycaemic control, frequency of exacerbations, sputum volume (in younger children), and recent imaging.
- **Preoperative Preparations:** May include hospital admission for physiotherapy, bronchodilators, mucolytics, and potentially antibiotics.
- **Operative Planning:** Considerations for timely physiotherapy, side room allocation, scheduling, and intravenous access.

### Tracheostomy

#### Perioperative Considerations
- **Increased Risk:** Children with a tracheostomy present greater perioperative challenges.
- **Key Information to Record:** Indication for tracheostomy, type and size of tracheostomy, usual care regimen, previous upper airway management details, home ventilation protocols.
- **Postoperative Care:** Varies based on individual needs; some may be discharged the same day, while others require critical care.
- **Compatibility with MRI:** Not all tracheostomy tubes are MRI-safe; changes may be necessary before scanning.
- **Multidisciplinary Involvement:** Includes the respiratory team and other relevant specialists.
## Endocrine and Metabolic

### Diabetes Mellitus in Pediatric Perioperative Management

#### Overview

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is the most prevalent endocrine disorder in childhood, requiring meticulous glucose control, especially during the perioperative period. Coordination with the child's endocrine team and a consultant anaesthetist is crucial to create an individualized management plan.

#### Preoperative Considerations
- **Consultation and Planning:** Thorough review by a consultant anaesthetist is essential to tailor the management plan based on the child’s treatment regimen, type and timing of surgery, and expected starvation period.
- **Insulin Management:**
  - **Minor Surgery:** Adjustments to the usual insulin regimen may suffice. For those on a basal-bolus regimen, continuation of long-acting insulin with a reduction or omission of short-acting insulin doses corresponding with missed meals is recommended.
  - **Major Surgery:** A variable-rate insulin infusion may be necessary, particularly when oral intake won't resume immediately post-surgery.
  - **Type 2 DM:** Management parallels that of Type 1, including modifications to insulin regimens and the continuation of oral hypoglycemics until the day of surgery, except for metformin.
- **Laboratory Assessments:** Recent HbA1c (within 3 months), serum electrolytes, current blood glucose levels, and blood or urinary ketones should be documented. Historical hypoglycemic episodes and symptoms must also be noted.

#### Surgical Scheduling
- **Control Optimization:** Surgery should be postponed if DM control is poor (HbA1c > 8.5% or 69 mmol/mol) until glycemic control is optimized.
- **Fasting Minimization:** To minimize fasting times, diabetic patients should be scheduled early in the operating list.

### Management of Other Complex Endocrine Conditions

#### Conditions Covered
- Conditions such as thyroid disease, diabetes insipidus, or phaeochromocytoma necessitate thorough preoperative evaluations.

#### Planning and Collaboration
- A comprehensive review by a consultant anaesthetist and development of a multidisciplinary plan with pediatric endocrine teams are imperative well ahead of the scheduled surgery.

### Perioperative Management of Metabolic Disorders

#### Risk of Decompensation

Children with metabolic disorders are at an elevated risk for acute decompensation triggered by infection, fasting, or stress from surgery.

#### Management Guidelines
- **Critical Care Facilities:** Management should occur in centers equipped with necessary critical care facilities.
- **Collaboration:** Close coordination with the pediatric metabolic team is essential.
- **Continuation of Treatment Regimens:** Supplemental cofactors and special diets should be maintained throughout the perioperative period.
- **Minimization of Fasting:** Fasting times should be minimized, and children should be scheduled early on the list to reduce risk.
- **Intravenous Solutions:** IV solutions containing 10% dextrose should be initiated in cases with hypoglycemia risk.

#### Preoperative Assessments
- Recommended tests include a full blood count (FBC), urea and electrolytes, blood gas analysis, ammonia concentration, and capillary blood glucose levels.

#### Individualized Planning
- Each patient should be evaluated by a consultant anaesthetist for individualized perioperative planning to ensure optimal management and safety during the surgical process.

### Renal Disease in Pediatric Perioperative Management

#### Overview

Effective management of children with renal disease in the perioperative period demands multidisciplinary care and comprehensive preoperative evaluation.

#### Preoperative Considerations
- **Medical History:** Cause, duration, and severity of renal impairment, along with involvement of other systems.
- **Assessments:** Daily urine output, fluid restriction, blood pressure, mode of dialysis, and current medications.
- **Diagnostic Reviews:** Recent blood tests and ECG.
- **Surgical Timing:** Coordinate surgery timing with preoperative dialysis sessions to optimize patient status.

### Management of Anaemia in Pediatric Patients

#### Risks and Preoperative Evaluations
- **Impact:** Anaemia can increase the likelihood of requiring perioperative blood transfusions and raise mortality risks after surgery.
- **Screening:** A full blood count (FBC) is recommended for all children undergoing major surgery or those with risk factors for anaemia.
  
#### Anaemia Diagnosis and Management
- **Initial Tests:** For new diagnoses, measure haematinics (folate, B12, ferritin) and conduct iron studies.
- **Treatment:** Address iron deficiency with preoperative oral iron supplementation; consider IV iron if no response.
- **Further Action:** If anaemia persists with normal haematinics and iron studies, pursue a clinical review and possible haematology referral.
- **Inherited Anaemia:** Children with known conditions such as thalassemia or sickle cell disease should have their care coordinated with a consultant anaesthetist and the haematology team.

### Sickle Cell Anaemia

#### Perioperative Management
- **Team Coordination:** Involve the haematology team comprehensively.
- **Preoperative Tests:** Include FBC, cross match, haemoglobin electrophoresis, and urea and electrolytes.
- **Fasting and Fluids:** Minimize fasting periods; begin IV fluids once fasting starts.
- **Surgical Planning:** Avoid day-case surgery; optimize haemoglobin levels preoperatively to around 10 g/dl. Consider exchange transfusion for high-risk procedures to reduce HbS to <30%.
- **Acute Pain Management:** Ensure the acute pain team is aware of the patient’s history, especially if chronic pain is a concern.

### Cardiac Disease in Non-Cardiac Pediatric Surgery

#### Risks and Stratification
- **Increased Risks:** Elevated 30-day mortality and higher incidence of perioperative cardiac arrests.
- **Disease Severity:** Children with complex or decompensated cardiac conditions (e.g., pulmonary hypertension, cardiac failure, arrhythmias, cyanosis) should be managed at specialist cardiac centers.

#### Preoperative and Surgical Considerations
- **Consultation:** Engage with the child’s cardiology team for a thorough discussion on recent cardiac investigations.
- **Venue for Surgery:** Refer children <2 years old or those undergoing major surgery to specialist centers. Low-risk patients may be managed locally but should still be discussed with specialist teams.
- **Medication Management:** Most cardiac medications should continue; specific alterations like antithrombotic therapy adjustments should be coordinated with cardiology, haematology, and surgical teams.
- **Specific Considerations:** Continue aspirin particularly for children with shunts; decisions on ACE inhibitors are based on individual assessment due to varying evidence in pediatric settings.
### Neurological Conditions in Pediatric Perioperative Management

#### Epilepsy

- **Common Condition:** Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders in children.
- **Preoperative Assessment:**
	- **Seizure History:** Type, frequency, and control of seizures.
	- **Medication Continuity:** Anti-epileptic drugs should be maintained throughout the perioperative period.
	- **Rescue Plan:** Document a clear plan for managing seizures.
	- **Recent Reviews:** Include latest epilepsy review, blood tests, and drug levels.
	- **Additional Considerations:** Specific patient factors, such as cardiac involvement in cases like tuberous sclerosis, should be assessed.
	- **Consultant Review:** Children with epilepsy syndromes or poorly controlled epilepsy should be evaluated by a consultant anaesthetist.

#### Cerebral Palsy

- **Characteristics:** A non-progressive brain injury from the neonatal period with variable severity.
- **Common Issues:** Muscle tone problems, movement issues, joint contractures, scoliosis, and often accompanying conditions such as epilepsy, sensory impairments, and gastrointestinal problems.
- **Preoperative Planning:**
	- **Individual Needs:** Detailed assessment to tailor list organization, surgical positioning, airway management, venous access, pain assessment, and postoperative care.
	- **Multidisciplinary Approach:** Involve a comprehensive team throughout the care process.

#### Neuromuscular Disease

- **Specific Planning Needs:** Due to potential impacts on respiratory and cardiac function and how these affect anaesthetic technique.
- **Considerations:**
	- **Respiratory and Cardiac Status:** Degree of impairment and need for postoperative critical care.
	- **Rhabdomyolysis Risk:** Particularly high in children under 8 years; avoid known triggers such as volatile agents and succinylcholine.
	- **Malignant Hyperthermia (MH):** Avoid triggers in children with a confirmed diagnosis or predisposition (e.g., central core disease, King-Denborough syndrome).

### Management of Antithrombotic Therapy

- **Balance of Risks:** Managing the balance between bleeding risks and the risk of perioperative thrombosis.
- **Medication Plans:** Clearly document when to stop and restart anticoagulants.
	- **Low Bleeding Risk Procedures:** Continue therapy, e.g., during dental treatments.
	- **Low Thrombosis Risk:** Temporary cessation might be possible.
	- **High Risks:** Consider bridging strategies such as heparin infusion for those at high risk of both bleeding and thrombosis
### Management of Anticoagulant Therapy for Children

### Management of Children with Implantable Devices

- **Special Precautions:** Necessary for devices like pacemakers, programmable shunts, and neurostimulators.
- **Preoperative Planning:**
	- **Device Management:** Positioning, diathermy use, and MRI compatibility.
	- **Consultation with Manufacturers:** Essential when compatibility with procedures like MRI is uncertain.
	- **Surgical Considerations:** Surgeons must be aware of the implications of medical devices on surgical techniques.
	- **Device Reprogramming:** Cardiac or neurophysiologists may need to reprogram devices, influencing the organization of the operating list.
	- **Electromagnetic Interference:** Deactivation of implantable defibrillators and reprogramming to asynchronous mode may be necessary.

### Conclusions on Pediatric Preoperative Assessment

- **Standardized Assessment:** Aligns pediatric care with adult practices, promoting individualized care, shared decision-making, and informed consent.
- **Benefits:** Enhances satisfaction, reduces cancellations on the day of surgery, and accommodates long wait times and demands for local care.
- **Efficiency and Safety:** Ensures that children undergo surgery safely and efficiently, at the optimal time and place, with the appropriate team.
