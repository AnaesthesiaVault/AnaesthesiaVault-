# Anaesthetic Neurotoxicity

- 2016 FDA released warning that anaesthetics in kids<3yrs and women in the 3rd trimester may affect the childs neurodevelopment. Subsequent studies suggest anaesthetic neurotoxicity is not a major contributing factor for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. What is the evidence?
## Prospective Studies
- GAS (General anaesthesia vs spinal anaesthesia trial). Hernia repairs, healthly children, sevoflurane <80mins vs spinal. No difference in cognitive testing at 2 and 5yrs old.
- PANDA (Paediatric neurodevelopmental assessment study). <3yrs, sevoflurane, hernia repairs, compared to unexposed siblings. IQ testing no difference between groups.
- MASK (Mayo anaesthesia safety in kids study). Unexposed vs singly exposed vs multiply exposed, <3 yrs. No effects on general intelligence. Multiply exposed may have behavioural and learning difficulties but this was secondary outcome.
## Retrospective Studies
- 3 studies with matched controls. All concluded:
	- Neither age <2yrs nor multiple anaesthetic exposures are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.
	- Age 3-4yrs associated with small deficits in neurodevelopmental outcomes but likely secondary to biopsychosocial and genetic factors. (e.g. T&As frequently done in this groupOSA may have impacted neurodevelopement, Dental treatment may signify poor nutrition and socioeconomic disability)
