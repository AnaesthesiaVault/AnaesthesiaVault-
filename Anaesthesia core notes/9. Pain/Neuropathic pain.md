# Summary

![](Pasted%20image%2020240521021220.png)

# Neuropathic Pain

## Definition

- Pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system.
- Occurs due to a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system.

## Characteristics

- Can be central or peripheral.
- Burning pain, electric shock-like pain.
- Paroxysmal, spontaneous, or evoked.

## Incidence

- 6-8% of the general population.
- 20% of diabetics.
- 8% of herpes zoster patients.

## Features

### Allodynia

- A painful response to a normally painless stimulus.

### Hyperalgesia

- An exaggerated response to a normally painful stimulus.
	- **Primary Hyperalgesia**: Occurs within the zone of injury and is caused by changes at the injury site itself.
	- **Secondary Hyperalgesia**: Occurs around the zone of injury and results from neuroplasticity and remodelling.

### Hyperpathia

- Pain in response to a stimulus despite sensory impairment.

### Phantom Pain

- Pain felt in a part of the body that is no longer present or from which the brain no longer receives signals.

### Plasticity

- The ability of the nervous system to adapt or change according to its environment.

## Pathophysiology

- Neuropathic pain arises as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.
- Mechanisms operate at both central and peripheral levels:
	- **Peripheral Nerves**: Sensitization, ectopic transmission, and spontaneous discharges.
	- **Central Modulatory Systems**: Changes in spinal neurons lead to central sensitization.

### Peripheral Sensitization

- **Mechanisms**:
	- Increased expression of sodium and calcium channels in unmyelinated (C-fiber) and thinly myelinated (Aδ-fiber) primary afferent neurons leads to spontaneous discharges, reduced thresholds for activation, enhanced responses to stimuli, and abnormal neuronal sprouting (e.g., neuroma formation).
- **Results**: Drives secondary changes in the spinal cord dorsal horn, leading to central sensitization.

### Central Sensitization

- **Mechanisms**:
	- Increased neuronal activity in response to noxious stimuli.
	- Expansion of neuronal receptive fields.
	- Spread of spinal hyperexcitability to other segments.
- **Glutamate NMDA Receptor**: Plays a central role in these changes.
- **Descending Modulatory Control**: Dysfunction of descending inhibitory serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways contributes to central sensitization.

### Drug Targets

- **Sodium Channels**: Carbamazepine, lidocaine.
- **Calcium Channels (α2δ subunit)**: Gabapentin, pregabalin.
- **Descending Serotonergic and Noradrenergic Pathways**: Serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).

### Pathogenesis of Neuropathic Pain

1. **Nerve Damage**
	- Leads to neuronal injury in the peripheral nervous system.
2. **Release of Chemicals**
	- Inflammatory factors, neurotransmitters, etc., from injured neurons.
3. **Ion Disturbance**
	- Disturbance in Na+/K+ balance within damaged sensory neurons raises neurons' resting membrane potential, making them more likely to depolarize.
4. **Depolarization**
	- Triggered by the same pain stimulus, leading to more nociceptive depolarizations.

### Nociceptive Fiber Involvement

- **Small, Unmyelinated C-fibers**: Carry pain information slowly, altering the perception of dull, achy pain and temperature.
- **Myelinated A-delta fibers**: Carry well-localized pain information related to specific stimuli, altering the perception of pain and temperature.
- **Myelinated A-beta fibers**: Carry pressure and light touch information, contributing to hyper-sensitization of the second-order sensory neuron.

### Pain Descriptions

- **C-fiber Damage**: Gnawing pain.
- **A-delta Fiber Damage**: Burning pain.
- **Depolarizations**: Shooting pain, lancinating pain.

### Phenomena

- **Hyperalgesia**: Worse pain in response to a normally painful stimulus.
- **Allodynia**: Pain in response to a normally non-painful stimulus.

## Mechanisms of Neuropathic Pain

1. **Spontaneous Neuronal Activity**
	- Primary afferent neuron activity (e.g., neuroma).
2. **Mechanosensitivity**
	- Associated with chronic nerve compression.
3. **Demyelination**
	- Short-circuits between pain fibers and other types of fibers.
4. **Functional Reorganization**
	- Sensory input from surrounding nerves emphasizes input from the area of injury.
5. **Spontaneous Electrical Activity**
	- Dorsal horn cells or thalamic nuclei.
6. **Segmental Inhibition Release**
	- In the spinal cord.
7. **Loss of Descending Inhibitory Influences**
	- Dependent on normal sensory input.
8. **Lesions of Thalamus or Supraspinal Structures**

## Aetiology
### Mechanisms of Etiology

- **Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy**
	- Oxidative stress, microvascular ischemia, decreased axonal transport, medication-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.
- **HIV Neuropathy**
	- Antiretroviral toxic neuropathy, direct nerve injury, distal sensory polyneuropathy.
- **Post-herpetic Neuralgia**
	- Sensitization, deafferentation.

- **Radicular Pain**
	- Male, obesity, smoking, prior radicular pain, anxiety, depression, heavy manual labor, work with bending/lifting, chronic vibration exposure.

## Assessment

### Screening Tools

- painDetect
- ID-Pain
- Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS)
- Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ)
- Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questions (DN4)

#### DN4 Questionnaire

**Patient Interview**

1. Does the pain have any of the following characteristics?
	- Burning, painful sensation of cold, electric shocks.
2. Is the pain associated with any of the following symptoms in the same area?
	- Tingling, pins and needles, numbness, itching.

**Patient Examination** 3. Is the pain located in an area where the physical examination may reveal one or more of the following characteristics?

- Hypoesthesia to touch, hypoesthesia to prick.

4. In the painful area, can the pain be caused or increased by:
	- Brushing.

**Scoring**

- YES = 1 point
- NO = 0 points
- Patient's score: ____/10
- If the patient’s score is ≥4, the test is positive (sensitivity 82.9%; specificity 89.9%).

### Clinical Tests
#### Clinical Assessment

- _Listen_ to the verbal description of pain and any non-painful symptoms in the same area as the pain. 
- _Locate_ the region of pain and document with a pain drawing, created either by the patient or by the physician. Any abnormal sensations may also be highlighted on the same illustration. 
- _Look_ for sensory abnormalities and recognise the distribution pattern. A careful inspection of the painful body area should be carried out and any differences in colour, texture, temperature, etc. should be noted. A simple bedside examination of somatosensory functions is recommended, including touch, cold, warmth and pain sensibility.
- The aim is to identify altered sensation in the painful area, and hence responses should be compared with a non-painful adjacent area.

#### Negative Symptoms and Signs

- **Tactile hypoesthesia/numbness**: Touch skin with a painter’s brush, cotton swab, or gauze.
- **Hypoalgesia**: Single pin-prick with a safety pin or sharp stick (e.g., cocktail stick/toothpick).
- **Thermal hypoesthesia**:
	- Cold (10°C): Calibrated metal roller or glass with water, acetone.
	- Hot (40°C): Calibrated metal roller or glass with water.

#### Positive Symptoms and Signs

- **Mechanical allodynia (dynamic)**: Stroke skin with a painter’s brush, cotton swab, or gauze.
- **Mechanical hyperalgesia (static)**: Firm pressure applied with the finger.
- **Mechanical hyperalgesia (punctuate/pin-prick)**: Prick with a safety pin, sharp stick, or stiff von Frey hair.
- **Temporal summation**: Prick with safety pin or sharp stick at intervals of <3 for 30 s duration.
- **Cold hyperalgesia (20°C)**: Calibrated metal roller, glass with water, acetone.
	- Control: Objects at skin temperature.
- **Heat hyperalgesia (40°C)**: Calibrated metal roller, glass with water.
	- Control: Objects at skin temperature.
- **Mechanical deep hyperalgesia (somatic)**: Apply manual light pressure at joints or muscles
## Differential
### Neuropathic Pain

- **Listen**: Common descriptors: shooting, electric shock, burning, tingling, itching, numbness.
- **Locate**: The painful region may not necessarily be the same as the site of injury. Pain occurs in the neurological territory of the affected structure (nerve, root, spinal cord, brain).
- **Look**: Apply bedside sensory tests. Conduct aetiology-specific tests if appropriate.

### Nociceptive Pain

- **Listen**: Common descriptors: aching, throbbing, stiffness.
- **Locate**: The painful region is typically localized at the site of injury.
- **Look**: Physical manipulation causes pain at the site of injury.

- Treat comorbid conditions.
- Patient education.
- Non-pharmacological treatment: physiotherapy and psychotherapy.

### Pharmacological Treatment
- **First-line Treatments**:
  - **Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)**: Low-dose amitriptyline or other TCAs.
  - **α2δ-Ligands (Gabapentinoids)**: Pregabalin and gabapentin.
  - **Topical Lidocaine**: For localized neuropathic pain.
  - **Selective Serotonin/Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)**: Sometimes included as first-line, sometimes second-line therapy.
- **Drugs with Good Evidence for Non-localized Neuropathic Pain**:
  - **α2δ-Ligands**: Pregabalin, gabapentin.
  - **TCAs**: Low-dose amitriptyline or other TCAs.
  - **SNRIs**: Duloxetine, venlafaxine.
  - **Opioids**: Tramadol, methadone, and morphine.
- **Guideline Recommendations**:
  - Reserve tramadol and stronger opioid analgesics for secondor third-line treatment.

### Treatment Lines

  - Pregabalin.
  - TCAs.
  - Topical lidocaine.
- **Second Line**:
  - Opioids.
  - Pregabalin.
  - SNRIs.

  - Tramadol.

### Non-pharmacological Options
- **Recommendations**:
  - Use of psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy.
  - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) alongside appropriate physiotherapy and pharmacological treatment.
- **Patient Education**:
  - Comprehensive patient education to improve treatment outcomes.
- **Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)**:
  - Widely used for neuropathic and nociceptive pain.
  - Recommended by EFNS Task Force as a preliminary or adjunct therapy due to its safety, non-invasiveness, and cost-effectiveness, despite a lack of robust efficacy data.

This structured format provides a comprehensive overview of neuropathic pain, its pathophysiology, and treatment options, suitable for academic reference and easy copying into the Obsidian program.

## Central Neuropathic Pain Algorithm
- **Initial Therapy**:
	
	- Pregabalin (preferred due to clinical experience and lower contraindications).
	- Amitriptyline (check for tolerability and contraindications).
- **Evaluation at 2-4 Weeks**:
	
	- **Response**: Continue current treatment.
	- **Failure**: Switch to different class.
		- Amitriptyline or other treatment options (Tramadol, Strong opioids).
- **If Recurrence**:
	
	- Sustained response at 3 months: Consider slow down-titration.
## Peripheral Neuropathic Pain Algorithm
- **Initial Therapy**:
	
	- Gabapentinoids (Pregabalin, gabapentin).
	- Low-dose TCAs (Amitriptyline).
	- SNRIs (Duloxetine, venlafaxine).
- **Evaluation at 2-4 Weeks**:
	
	- **Partial Response**: Continue current treatment.
	- **Failure**: Switch to different class or add drug from another class.
		- Recommended combinations: Gabapentinoids + SNRI, Gabapentinoids + TCA, SNRI + TCA.
- **If Recurrence**:
	
	- Sustained response at 3 months: Consider slow down-titration.
- **Other Treatment Options**:
	
	- Opioids, Tramadol for mixed pain, combinations of different classes (Gabapentinoids + opioids).
- **Referral**:
	
	- Refer to specialist or specialized unit if failure persists.

# Common Disorders
## Peripheral Neuropathic Pain
- **First-line Options**: α2δ-ligands (pregabalin and gabapentin), low-dose TCAs, and SNRIs (duloxetine and venlafaxine).
- **Preferred Option**: Pregabalin, based on tolerability and pharmacokinetics.
- **Opioids**: Reserved for later use, only after switching to another monotherapy or combination therapy with multiple first-line agents fails.

## Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy
- Recommendations are the same as for peripheral neuropathic pain.

## Post-Herpetic Neuralgia
- **First-line Recommendations**: Pregabalin (preferred), gabapentin, and low-dose amitriptyline.

## Trigeminal Neuralgia

### AAN-EFNS Guidelines
- **Carbamazepine** (200-1200 mg/day): Recommended as the drug of choice for classic TN due to its robust treatment response. However, its efficacy may be compromised by poor tolerability and pharmacokinetic interactions.
- **Oxcarbazepine**: Similar efficacy to carbamazepine in controlling pain in TN but with fewer drug-drug interactions.
- **Add-on Therapy**: Limited evidence supports the use of lamotrigine or a switch to baclofen in cases where first-line therapy fails. Recent Cochrane reviews conclude insufficient evidence to recommend these treatments in TN.

### Recommendations
- The SA panel recommends the use of carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine for the treatment of TN.
- **Preferred Agents**: Oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine.
- **Other Agents**: Some agents recommended in guidelines from other regions are not available in South Africa. The panel requests that the South African regulatory authorities evaluate the evidence for the lidocaine patch and topical capsaicin in localized peripheral neuropathic pain and consider approval of these agents in South Africa.
- **HIV-associated Neuropathy**: No specific therapy recommended; management should follow recommendations for peripheral neuropathic pain.

## Central Neuropathic Pain
- **First-line Recommendations**: Pregabalin (preferred) and amitriptyline.
- **Companion Therapies**: Cognitive-behavioural therapy and physical therapy are recommended alongside pharmacological management.
- **Invasive Options**: Dorsal root entry zone lesioning (DREZotomy) is not currently recommended. This procedure involves the destruction of nociceptive fibers and the dorsal root entry zones to destroy neurons sustaining the painful state. Limited evidence suggests spinal cord stimulation in segmental mononeuropathies refractory to drug treatment, but there is a risk of worsening neuropathic pain after this invasive procedure.

# Peripheral Sensitization
- **COX-mediated Production of Prostaglandins**: Lowers activation threshold of A-delta and C-fibers.
- **Inflammatory Soup**: Reduces activation thresholds, activates dormant receptors, and causes supra-normal responses to stimuli.
- **Capsaicin/Vanilloid Receptor**: Activated by heat and low tissue pH, enhancing pain sensitivity.
- **Substance P Release**: Activates second-order pain neurons.
- **Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP)**: Causes vasodilation, increased temperature, redness, and swelling.
- **Nerve Sprouting**: Contributes to peripheral sensitization.
