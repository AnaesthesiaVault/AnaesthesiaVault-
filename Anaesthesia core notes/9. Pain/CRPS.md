# CRPS
## Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

- **Central Nervous System Lesion**: Trauma (surgery, nerve compression, fracture, tissue trauma, ischemia, sprain) can lead to CRPS. ACE inhibitors may also be implicated.
- **Phases**:
	- **Acute Phase**:
		- **Neurogenic Inflammation**: Interaction with proinflammatory cytokine profile.
		- **Sympathetic Dysregulation**: Influences central and peripheral nociceptive sensitization.
	- **Chronic Phase**:
		- **Central Sensorimotor Dysregulation**: Results in decreased perfusion and grey matter volume in the cortex, affecting limbic and sensorimotor areas.
### Mechanisms
#### Inflammatory and Peripheral Sensitization

- **Inflammation Mediators**: IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, CGRP, bradykinin, substance P, IL-10.
- **Nociceptive Neuron Density**: Increased in affected areas.
- **Sympatho-Afferent Coupling**: Upregulated adrenergic receptor sensitivity on nociceptive fibers.
- Nociceptive sensitization (↓ depolarization thresholds) + coupling between sympathetic nerves and peripheral nociceptors
- **CNS:** Central sensitization
- **Autonomic dysregulation** due to coupling
- Peripheral Nervous System

#### Genetic Susceptibility

- **Role in CRPS Development**: Genetic factors contribute to predisposition.

## CRPS Types

- **CRPS I (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy)**: Continuous pain (allodynia or hyperalgesia) post-trauma, not localized to a single peripheral nerve, worse with movement, and associated with sympathetic hyperactivity. Symptoms include cool, clammy skin progressing to stiffness and atrophy.
	
	- **Treatment**: Mobility, physiotherapy, rehabilitation, sympathetic nerve blocks.
- **CRPS II (Causalgia)**: Burning pain due to partial peripheral nerve damage, can radiate beyond the nerve's distribution, associated with sympathetic and vasomotor abnormalities, resulting in cold, moist, swollen skin becoming atrophic.
	
	- **Treatment**: Sympathetic nerve blocks.

## Clinical Diagnostic Criteria (IASP)

1. **Pain Disproportionate to Event**.
2. **Symptom Categories (three of four)**:
	- **Sensory**: Hyperalgesia, allodynia.
	- **Vasomotor**: Temperature asymmetry, skin color changes.
	- **Sudomotor/Edema**: Swelling, sweating asymmetry.
	- **Motor/Trophic**: Decreased range of motion, motor dysfunction, trophic changes.
3. **Sign Categories (two of four)**:
	- **Sensory**: Hyperalgesia, allodynia.
	- **Vasomotor**: Temperature asymmetry, skin color changes.
	- **Sudomotor/Edema**: Swelling, sweating asymmetry.
	- **Motor/Trophic**: Decreased range of motion, motor dysfunction, trophic changes.
4. **No Other Diagnosis**: Explains signs and symptoms better.

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Neuropathic Pain Syndromes**: Peripheral neuropathy, nerve entrapment, radiculopathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, de-afferentation pain, plexopathy, motor neuron disease.
- **Vascular Diseases**: Thrombosis, acrocyanosis, atherosclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, erythromelalgia.
- **Inflammation**: Erysipelas, unspecified inflammation, bursitis, seronegative arthritis, rheumatologic diseases.
- **Myofascial Pain Syndromes**: Overuse, disuse, tennis elbow, repetitive strain injury, fibromyalgia.
- **Psychiatric Problems**: Somatoform pain disorders, Munchausen syndrome.

## Clinical Features (STAMP)

- **Sensory**: Allodynia, hypo-/hyperalgesia, hypo-/hyperesthesia.
- **Trophic**: Skin, hair, nail changes.
- **Autonomic**: Swelling, edema, sweating.
- **Motor**: Weakness, contractures, atrophy.
- **Pain**
## Management

- **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Focusing on functional restoration.
	- **Components**:
		- Graded exercise
		- Physiotherapy
		- Multimodal analgesia
		- Cognitive behavioral therapy
		- Counselling
		- Goal setting
- **Advanced Treatments**: Sympathetic blockade, transcutaneous nerve stimulation, neuromodulation, acupuncture.
### Treatment Modalities for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)

#### 1. Physical, Occupational, and Psychological Therapy

- **Early Mobilization**: Initiate as soon as possible to prevent stiffness and muscle atrophy.
- **Graded Motor Imagery**: Progressive rehabilitation involving imagined movements before actual physical movements.
- **Mirror Therapy**: Use of mirror to create visual feedback, tricking the brain into perceiving movement in the affected limb.
- **Coping Mechanisms for Pain**: Includes relaxation training, thermal biofeedback, and graded exposure to reduce pain and anxiety.

#### 2. Regional

### 3. Sympathetic Nerve Block

- **Lumbar (Lower Limb) / Stellate Ganglion (Upper Limb)**: Limited evidence supporting efficacy; an increase in temperature in the affected extremity indicates a successful block.

### 4. Neuromodulation

- **Spinal Cord Stimulation**: Should be considered early in treatment to manage pain effectively.
- **Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation**: Emerging technique with promising results.

### Pharmacological Options

#### 1. Neuropathic Pain Medications

- **Gabapentin**: Supported by some randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence.
- **Amitriptyline**: Found to be equally effective as Gabapentin.
- **Carbamazepine**: Shown to reduce pain in small-scale trials.

#### 2. Anti-Inflammatories

- **NSAIDs**: Mixed results from small studies.
- **Steroids**: Early, short courses may be beneficial if inflammation is present.

#### 3. Bisphosphonates

- **Evidence**: Meta-analysis indicates potential benefits, though further research is required.
#### 4. Vitamin C (Prophylaxis)

- **Prophylactic Use**: Mixed results in clinical trials but considered safe and non-invasive.
