### Guardianship and Administration Act 2000: Health Care Principle

#### Health Care Principle (When Making a Decision)

**Source:** Guardianship and Administration Act 2000 (Schedule 1, Part 2 Section 12)

1. **Definition of Health Care Principle:**
	
	- The health care principle authorizes a guardian, the adult guardian, the tribunal, or any entity responsible for prescribed special health care to exercise power for an adult.
	- This power must be exercised:
		- (a) In the least restrictive manner on the adult’s rights.
		- (b) Only if necessary to:
			- (i) Maintain or promote the adult’s health or well-being.
			- (ii) Be in the adult’s best interests under all circumstances.

	_Example:_ If there is a less intrusive way to meet an identified need, it should be chosen to respect the adult's rights.

2. **Decision-Making Process:**
	
	- The guardian, adult guardian, tribunal, or other entities must:
		- (a) Seek the adult’s views and wishes as much as possible.
		- (b) Consider information provided by the adult’s health provider (see Section 76 of the G&A Act 2000).
3. **Expression of Adult’s Views and Wishes:**
	
	- The adult’s views and wishes can be expressed:
		- (a) Orally.
		- (b) In writing (e.g., advance health directive).
		- (c) Through any other method (e.g., conduct).
4. **Right to Refuse Health Care:**
	
	- The health care principle does not affect an adult's right to refuse health care.
5. **Consent to Special Health Care:**
	
	- When consenting to special health care for an adult, the tribunal or other entity must:
		- Seek the views of the following in order:
			- (a) A guardian appointed by the tribunal.
			- (b) An attorney for a health matter appointed by the adult.
			- (c) The statutory health attorney if no other guardian or attorney is mentioned.
# Steps Must Be Followed if an Incapacitated Individual Requires Urgent Treatment
1. **Advance Directive:**
	
	- An advance directive must be honoured if the instructions and expressed preferences are appropriate to the circumstances and there is no reason to believe the patient has changed their mind.
2. **If No Advance Directive or Not Relevant:**
	
	- Decision-making falls to surrogates in the following order of precedence:
		
		- a. A proxy mandated in writing by the patient to make decisions on their behalf.
		- b. A person authorised by law or court order.
		- c. The patient's spouse or partner.
		- d. Parent.
		- e. Grandparent.
		- f. Adult child.
		- g. Brother or sister.
	- If none of the above surrogates exists or can be contacted, healthcare professionals must decide based on the "best interests" principle.
		
3. **Urgent, Life-Saving, or Emergency Procedures (GSH Policy):**
	
	- If none of the above surrogates can be contacted and urgent treatment is required, the doctor must notify the GSH Manager: Medical Services (if time permits) to obtain authority to proceed without consent.

#### Abbreviations

- **Pro:** Proxy
- **Co:** Court-authorised person
- **Spo:** Spouse/Partner
- **Pa:** Parent
- **G:** Grandparent

### Additional Notes

- **Best Interests Principle:**
	- When making decisions without an available surrogate, healthcare professionals must consider the patient's values, beliefs, and preferences, if known. If unknown, the decision should reflect what a reasonable person would likely prefer.
- **Legal and Emergency Treatment:**
	- Treatment authorized by law or necessary to protect public health may proceed under the National Health Act.
	- Emergency treatment to prevent death or irreversible damage is allowed if the patient did not explicitly refuse such treatment.
# Consent for Impaired Capacity

- **Advance Directive:**
	
	- Honoured if appropriate to the circumstances and if no reason suggests the patient changed their mind.
- **Surrogates for Decision-Making (Order of Precedence):**
	
	- 1. A proxy mandated in writing by the patient.
	- 2. A person authorized by law or court order.
	- 3. The patient’s spouse or partner.
	- 4. Parent.
	- 5. Grandparent.
	- 6. Adult child.
	- 7. Brother or sister.
- **Best Interests Principle:**
	
	- If no surrogate exists or can be contacted, healthcare professionals should decide based on the "best interests" principle:
		- Consider the patient's values, beliefs, and preferences.
		- If unknown, choose what a reasonable person would likely prefer.
- **Legal and Emergency Treatment:**
	
	- Treatment authorized by law or necessary to protect public health may proceed under the National Health Act.
	- Emergency treatment to prevent death or irreversible damage is allowed if the patient did not refuse treatment "expressly, impliedly, or by conduct."
- **Involvement in Decision-Making:**
	
	- Even if lacking decisional capacity, patients should be included in the decision-making process as much as possible.
