# Adverse Events

## Adverse Event Protocol 1–when Adverse Event Occurs
### Get Help

- Call for another anaesthetist
- Call for the resuscitation trolley

### Continue Patient Care

- Focus on direct patient care, leave administrative tasks to others

### Designate an Incident Supervisor

- Assume overall control of the event
- Organize help and assign tasks in the OR
- Verify incident control (e.g., correct intubation)
- Involve other professionals as needed (e.g., ICU)
- Coordinate and communicate with everyone (surgeons, family, etc.)
- Close the theatre if necessary
- Do not turn off or unplug anything
- Access any memory in the machine–printout or photograph the screen
- Discard nothing (vials, needles, catheters, tubes, anything used)
- Alter nothing–preferably leave everything and lock up
- Document everything

### Contact the Hospital

- Arrange immediate comfort and support for patient and/or family
	- Share as much information as possible
	- Be objective and understanding, avoid blame

### Designate a Follow-up Supervisor

- Ensure protocol adherence
- Consider a group debriefing
- Maintain ongoing communication between caregivers, patient, family
- Pursue accident investigation, file reports, provide feedback

### Document Everything

- Record strict narrative entries
- Write a detailed account of the event and secure it
- Review all formal reports submitted

### Continue Involvement Post-event if Patient Survives

- Communicate with caregivers about care, make changes, and suggestions

## Approach to Death

### Action Steps

#### Identification
- Confirm the patient's identity.

#### Patient Safety
- Ensure the safety and care of other patients in the vicinity.

#### Prioritisation
- Prioritize immediate tasks and delegate responsibilities as necessary.

#### Notification
- Inform the relevant personnel and authorities, including family members.

#### Investigation
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death.

#### Classification
- Classify the type of death (e.g., natural, unexpected, due to complications).

#### Analysis
- Analyze the collected data to determine contributing factors.

#### Recommendations
- Formulate actionable recommendations to prevent similar incidents.

#### Learning
- Implement educational sessions and training to disseminate findings and recommendations.

### Reaudit
- Conduct a follow-up audit to ensure recommendations have been implemented and are effective.

### Investigation

#### Systemic Analysis
- Identify latent and systemic failures that may have contributed to the event.
- Examine contributory features, including environmental, organizational, and individual factors.

### Just Culture

#### Response to Human Error
- **Human Error:** Console the individual involved.
- **At-Risk Behavior:** Provide coaching and guidance.
- **Reckless Behavior:** Apply disciplinary measures as appropriate.

### Debriefing Team

- **IF SPOTS:**
  - Ensure that debriefing includes the identification of any system-level issues, individual factors, and team dynamics that contributed to the event.

# Adverse Drug Reactions
## Definition

A response to a medicine which is **noxious and unintended**, including lack of efficacy, and which **occurs at any dosage** and can also result from overdose, misuse or abuse of a medicine.

## Classification of Adverse Drug Reactions

| Type of Reaction (Mnemonic)                | Features | Examples                                                                                                                       | Management                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A: Dose related (Augmented)                | Common   | Dry mouth with tricyclic antidepressants, respiratory depression with opioids, serotonin syndrome with SSRIs, digoxin toxicity | Reduce dose or withhold drug. Consider effects of concomitant therapy |
| B: Non-dose related (Bizarre)              | Uncommon | Immunologic reactions: anaphylaxis to penicillin, Idiosyncratic reactions: malignant hyperthermia with general anesthetics     | Withhold and avoid in future                                          |
| C: Dose related and time related (Chronic) | Uncommon | Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression by corticosteroids, osteonecrosis of the jaw with bisphosphonates              | Reduce dose or withhold; withdrawal may have to be prolonged          |
| D: Time related (Delayed)                  | Uncommon | Carcinogenesis, Tardive dyskinesia, Teratogenesis, Leucopenia with lomustine                                                   | Often intractable                                                     |
| E: Withdrawal (End of use)                 | Uncommon | Withdrawal syndrome with opiates or benzodiazepines (e.g., insomnia, anxiety)                                                  | Reintroduce drug and withdraw slowly                                  |
| F: Unexpected failure of therapy (Failure) | Common   | Inadequate dosage of an oral contraceptive when used with an enzyme inducer, Resistance to antimicrobial agents                | Increase dosage. Consider effects of concomitant therapy              |

## Recommendations for Avoiding Drug Errors

### Actions and Strength of Evidence

1. Carefully read labels on drugs/syringes before use - Strongly recommended
2. Optimize legibility and content of labels on ampoules and syringes - Strongly recommended
3. Always label syringes - Strongly recommended
4. Use formal organization of drug drawers and workspace - Strongly recommended
5. Double-check labels with a second person or device - Recommended
6. Report and review i.v. drug administration errors during anaesthesia - Recommended
7. Focus on minimizing drug error risk through inventory management - Recommended
8. Avoid similar packaging and presentation of drugs - Recommended
9. Use prefilled syringes rather than ampoules - Possibly recommended
10. Anaesthetist administering drugs should label them - Possibly recommended
11. Use agreed colour coding by class of drug - Possibly recommended
12. Use syringe position or needle coding - Unclear

## ANZCA PD on Injectable Drugs in Anaesthesia

### Individual Action

- Write legibly, maintain good communication, minimize distraction, ensure adequate light.

### Prior to Drawing Up and Administration

- Read labels (check name/dose), regularly check for expired drugs, draw up one drug at a time and label, discard if uncertain, double-check with a second person/automated device, do not share ampoules.

### Labels

- Colour-coded by drug class using pre-printed labels.

### Storage During Anaesthesia

1. Use separate trays for emergency and routine drugs.
2. Store different routes separately (e.g., epidural vs. IV).

### Storage

- Keep storage tidy, organized, and standardized. Maintain emergency drug drawers and store look-alike ampoules apart.

### System

- Avoid look-alike packaging, communicate packaging changes, standardize drug concentrations, use prediluted formulations, maintain an inventory to minimize drug error.

### Infusion Drugs

- Standardize drug concentration, label patient end of infusion line, use a one-way valve to avoid siphoning of infused drugs.
# Analysis of Critical Event
## Event Analysis

### Root Cause

- Identify a single cause of the event.

### London Protocol

- System analysis to identify all contributory factors and system modifications to improve.

#### Swiss Cheese Model

- Latent Failures:
	- Understaffing, workload, supervision, maintenance of equipment, conflict of priorities.
- Active Failures:
	- Slips (wrong drug, wrong labelling), cognitive errors (forgetfulness, ignorance, misreading the situation), violations (deviations from safe practice and procedures).

### Treat and Error Management

- Retrospective and prospective approach to avoiding adverse events:
	- Threat: risks or challenges outside the operator's control.
	- Errors: actions of personnel exacerbating threats.
	- Goal: Identify and mitigate threats, correct erroneous actions of team members.
