# DNAR ((Do Not Attempt Resuscitation)

## Definition and Legal Framework
- DNAR orders are legally binding documents specifying treatments an individual would refuse in the future if they lack capacity, as outlined by the Mental Capacity Act 2005.
- Applicable to individuals over 18 years of age (16 in Scotland), typically retained by the patient’s GP, family, or friends.
- To be valid, the following conditions must be met:
  1. The individual must have capacity at the time of signing.
  2. The directive must be signed with a witness present.
  3. The directive must specify the decision applied to a specific treatment if the individual’s life is at risk.
- Failure to meet any of these conditions may render the directive invalid.

**Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) Statement:**
“_Where a patient lacks the capacity to decide, health care practitioners must respect any valid advance refusal of treatment._”

## Patient's Decision Regarding DNAR During Perioperative Period

The patient must choose to:

1. Discontinue the DNAR during anaesthesia and surgery, reinstating it once discharged from the recovery room.
2. Modify the DNAR to permit the use of specific drugs and techniques necessary for anaesthesia:
   - Monitoring
   - Airway manipulation ± ventilation (understanding that the patient will breathe spontaneously at the end)
   - Vasopressors / Antiarrhythmics
   - Defibrillation / Cardioversion
   - CPR
3. Not modify the DNAR at all, which is mostly incompatible with General Anaesthesia.

## Consent
1. Documentation: DNAR and Advance Directive (source required).
2. Signatures:
   - Patient (if capacity exists).
   - If no capacity: Proxy or relative.
   - Clinician in charge of patient's care.
   - Anaesthetist.
   - Surgeon.

## Factors Influencing DNAR Decision

The decision ultimately rests with the **senior clinician in charge of the patient's care**, considering:

1. The likely clinical outcome: Success probability of CPR and expected recovery level.
2. The patient's known or ascertainable wishes, views, feelings, beliefs, and values.
3. The patient's human rights: The right to life and freedom from degrading treatment.
4. Likelihood of the patient experiencing pain and suffering.
5. Level of awareness the patient has of their existence and surroundings.

Documentation: Discussion with the patient and/or relatives (if incompetent, or with the patient's consent), reasons, and decision process.

## Principles to Follow
- Standard four ethical principles.
- Systematic consideration of clinical data, patient characteristics, and values using four topics:
  1. Medical indications.
  2. Patient preferences.
  3. Quality of life.
  4. Contextual features.

## Guidelines for Perioperative Physician-Patient Conversation
1. Provide information, options, data, and prognosis in writing.
2. Ensure the patient has an advocate present during important discussions.
3. Allow sufficient time for the patient to process the diagnosis.
4. Offer a list of physicians for second opinions.
5. Ensure Health Care Proxy document is on the chart before elective surgery.
6. Identify health care advocate/agent in urgent and emergent situations.
7. There is no automatic suspension of DNR orders during the perioperative period.
8. Discuss advance directives during preoperative evaluation and immediately preoperatively with the anaesthesiology team for clarification.

## Ethical Considerations
- It is never ethically permissible to automatically suspend DNR orders for surgery.
- Patients should have the option to suspend their DNR orders for surgery to align with their values and healthcare goals.

## Discussion of DNR with Patient and Family at Preoperative Evaluation
1. Ask permission to discuss the DNR.
2. Start with what the patient and family already know.
3. Communicate in short, clear sentences.
4. Allow for periods of silence.
5. Be prepared for emotional responses.
6. Plan for the next steps in care.

## Summary
- Perioperative patients have the right to make decisions regarding their surgical and anaesthesia care, including issuing DNR orders as part of an Advance Directive.
- Health care providers must respect the patient’s wishes regarding care.
- If an anaesthesiologist is uncomfortable with providing care to a patient with a DNR order, this must be addressed with the surgical team and patient.
- Automatic suspension or continuation of a DNR order for surgery is unjustifiable. Consultation with the patient and potentially with an ethics expert or committee is required to determine the appropriate course of action for the perioperative period.

# Palliative Care

## Essential Components
### Advance Directives

- Definition: Legal documents outlining a patient's wishes regarding medical treatment if they become unable to communicate.
- Importance: Ensures that patient preferences are respected even when they cannot actively participate in decision-making.

### Decision Making

- Definition: The process of making choices regarding medical care, often involving patients, families, and healthcare providers.
- Importance: Empowers patients and families to make informed decisions about care and treatment options.

### Hospice Care

- Definition: A type of care focused on providing comfort and support to patients in the final stages of a terminal illness.
- Importance: Prioritizes quality of life and symptom management over curative treatments.

### Communication

- Definition: The exchange of information between patients, families, and healthcare providers.
- Importance: Facilitates understanding, ensures that care aligns with patient values and preferences, and supports emotional well-being.

### Goals of Care

- Definition: The overall aims of medical treatment and care, based on patient values and clinical circumstances.
- Importance: Guides treatment plans and decisions, ensuring that care is patient-centered and aligned with their wishes.

### Pain & Symptom Management

- Definition: The practice of alleviating physical discomfort and other distressing symptoms in patients with serious illnesses.
- Importance: Enhances patient comfort, improves quality of life, and supports the overall well-being of patients and their families.
- Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual **(WHO)**
	**1. MDT** Palliative Care Assessment (Pain and symptom assessment, holistic evaluation, advance directives / proxy, prognostication, family assessment)
	**2. Communication** - physician and nurse
	**3. Withholding and withdrawing organ support**
	**4. Pain and Symptom Control**
	**5. Comfort Care** (wounds, hydration, etc)
	**6. Ethical Issues** (terminal sedation, euthanasia, etc)
## Ethical Issues in Palliative Care
- **Autonomy and Non-maleficence**
	
	- **Definition**: Respecting patients' rights to make their own decisions and avoiding harm.
	- **Examples**:
		- Respecting advance directives
		- Proxy informed consent
		- Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders
		- Withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining treatment
- **Beneficence**
	
	- **Definition**: Acting in the best interest of the patient to improve their quality of life.
	- **Example**: Achieved quality of life post-treatment
- **Distributive Justice**
	
	- **Definition**: Ensuring fair access to healthcare resources.
	- **Example**: Equality of access to the best available care
- **Decisional Capacity and Consent**
	
	- **Definition**: Assessing a patient's ability to understand and consent to medical decisions.
	- **Examples**:
		- Pediatric patients
		- Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients
- **Dignity**
	
	- **Definition**: Respecting the inherent worth and autonomy of patients.
	- **Example**: Ensuring a dignified death
- **Honesty/Truth Telling**
	
	- **Definition**: Providing truthful information to patients to support their participation in decision-making.
	- **Example**: Augmenting patient participation in decision making
- **Privacy and Confidentiality**
	
	- **Definition**: Protecting patient information and respecting their privacy.
	- **Example**: Ensuring patient wishes regarding privacy are respected

## Futility

### Definition

Futility refers to the unacceptable unlikelihood of achieving an effect that the patient has the capacity to appreciate as a benefit.

### Types of Futility

#### Quantitative Futility
- **Definition**: The likelihood that treatment will confer any benefit is unacceptably low.
- **Decision**: This is a medical decision.

#### Qualitative Futility
- **Definition**: The quality of the resulting patient benefit is unacceptably low.
- **Decision**: This is a family/patient value-based decision.

#### Physiological Futility
- **Definition**: The intervention is not expected to produce its desired physiologic effect.

#### Imminent Demise Futility
- **Definition**: The medical condition is irreversible, and the patient is expected to die before discharge and not recover interactive capacity before death.

#### Clinical or Overall Futility
- **Definition**: The intervention will not restore the patient's capacity to interact with the environment and continue human development, resulting in a poor-quality outcome.
