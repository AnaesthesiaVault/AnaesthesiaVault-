# Perioperative Fluid Management in Children: Can We Sum it All up Now?
## Introduction
- Objective:
	- maintain or re-establish the normal physiological state in children:
		- normal extracellular fluid volume
		- normal blood volume
		- normal tissue perfusion
		- normal metabolic function
		- normal electrolyte and acid–base status
- Maintenance or background infusion is used to meet the normal fluid and glucose requirements over the course of the perioperative fasting time
	- supplemented as needed by fluid replacement to maintain the normal extracellular fluid volume
	- volume replacement to normalize blood volume
		- in case of circulatory instability and blood loss.
- The composition (hypotonic or isotonic) and the type (crystalloid or colloid) of intravenous fluids in paediatric anaesthesia have been subject of debate.
## Concept of Homeostasis

- Early 19th century, French physiologist Claude Bernard (1813–1878) established the use of scientific methods in medicine, originated the term internal environment (‘milieu inte ́rieur’) and stated that a free and independent existence of an organism was possible only because of the stability of the 'milieu interieur'.
- Definitions of Homeostasis:
	- Walter Cannon (1871–1945), coined the term ‘homeostasis’ as a system of active and passive mechanisms to maintain a steady state within an organism.
	- Arthur Guyton (1919–2003): a control system that tends to minimize disturbances to the internal environment.
- The strategy of maintaining homeostasis perioperatively in children was included in the present European SAFETOTS initiative, which is a multimodal approach to improve the safety in paediatric anaesthesia suggesting a 10-N paediatric anaesthesia quality checklist for a better maintenance of the perioperative homeostasis of children.
## Historical Development of Electrolyte Solutions for Perioperative Fluid Replacement
- The IV infusion of saline solution first reported in 1831 by Thomas Latta in patients dehydrated by cholera.
- In 1882, physiologist Sydney Ringer added potassium and calcium to a saline solution to sustain the contractility of isolated frog hearts.
- In 1883, biochemist Hartog Hamburger performed experiments with red blood cells in varying concentrations of salt and showed that saline 0.9% was isotonic with human blood.
- In 1932, paediatrician Alexis Hartmann modified Ringer’s solution by adding the stable metabolizable anion lactate (1⁄4Ringer’s lactate) as a precursor of the unstable bicarbonate to combat metabolic acidosis in children with diarrhoea.
- In 1923, physiologist Gamble and paediatrician Darrow described the electrolyte and acid–base composition of extracellular fluid by ‘Gamblegrams’ and initiated intravenous fluid therapy as an effective treatment for diarrhoeal dehydration.
- Several manufacturers have introduced balanced isotonic electrolyte solutions mimicking the composition of extracellular fluid more closely, containing acetate as bicarbonate precursor.

## Historical Development of Electrolyte Solutions for Intraoperative Maintenance Infusion
- In 1957, paediatricians Holiday and Segar provided calculations for ‘the maintenance need for water in parenteral fluid therapy’
	- derived 4-2-1 rule from the caloric expenditure of children
	- 4 ml/kg/h for the first 10 kg of weight, 2 ml/kg/h for the next 10 kg, and 1 ml/kg/h for each kilogram thereafter.
- They then analyzed the composition of human and cow’s milk to calculate the maintenance needs for electrolytes, and in the following years this led to the common practice of using hypotonic electrolyte solutions with glucose 5% for maintenance infusion in children.
- In the 1990s, this practice was questioned:
	- reports about postoperative hyponatraemic encephalopathy as a consequence of infusion of hypotonic electrolyte solutions and stress-induced elevated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels leading to cerebral oedema and respiratory insufficiency.
	- Other authors found that the intraoperative use of electrolyte solutions with glucose 5% was associated with hyperglycaemia
		- use of lower glucose concentrations of 1–2% was sufficient to maintain plasma glucose concentrations within the physiological range and to prevent a compensatory increase in lipid mobilization.
		- Several working groups recommended the use of isotonic electrolyte solutions with lower glucose concentrations of 1–2% for intraoperative maintenance infusion as a pragmatic approach to prevent any hyponatraemia, hypoglycaemia, lipolysis and hyperglycaemia.

- The theoretical in-vitro osmolarity (mOsmol/l) of all presented solutions is hypertonic because of the glucose content.
- After infusion, the glucose rapidly enters the cells to be metabolized, and the risk of hyponatraemia and hyponatraemic encephalopathy increases when the remaining in-vivo osmolality without glucose is low.
## Historical Development of Colloids for Perioperative Volume Replacement
- Subject of debate.
- Natural colloids (e.g. albumin) were used most often in paediatric anaesthesia, but in the 1990s, albumin was gradually replaced by gelatine (GEL) or hydroxyethyl starch (HES) because of lower costs and easier storage.
- In the following years, use of third generation HES (molecular weight 130 000 Da) gained popularity
	- Recently several randomized clinical studies showed that renal failure occurred more frequently in adult intensivecare patients with sepsis after HES infusion.
	- In paediatric animal studies, renal function was normal after both moderate (20 ml/kg) and high doses (50 ml/kg) of GEL and HES.
	- Haemostasis was comparable with a control group after moderate doses (10–20 ml/kg), but significantly impaired after high doses (40 ml/kg) of GEL and HES.
	- In clinical studies, HES 130 was well tolerated and effective in children with normal renal function undergoing major paediatric and paediatric cardiac surgery, and a recent meta-analysis found no impairment of renal function, blood loss and transfusion volume in children with perioperative HES infusion.
- In 2018, the European Medicines Agency considered removing HES-containing solutions from the market, and HES is now contraindicated in critically ill patients with sepsis or burns.
- The manufacturers decreased the maximum daily dose from 50 to 30ml/kg.
- In adults, incidence of anaphylactoid reactions is higher with GEL as compared with HES.
- In children, the incidence is possibly lower, but no safety studies with GEL in children are currently available.
- GEL and HES were initially dissolved in saline 0.9%, but presently both are also available in a balanced isotonic electrolyte solution to avoid iatrogenic acid–base and electrolyte alterations.

## Physiological Aspects
- The internal environment is represented by plasma and extracellular fluid (ECF).
- Small children have a larger extracellular fluid volume than adults:
	- premature infants 60%
	- neonates 40%
	- infants 30%
	- adults 20% of body weight
- The composition of plasma and ECF is similar across all age groups.
- The same solutions for infusion as for adults can be used for perioperative fluid replacement in children.
- The osmotic activity of an electrolyte solution is described in terms of its osmolality (mOsmol/kg H2O) or osmolarity (mOsmol/l).
	- The actual osmolality of plasma (288 mOsmol/kg H2O) is practically identical to the theoretical osmolarity (291 mOsmol/l) calculated from its analytical composition
	- This value (288 mOsmol/kg H2O) should be used as a reference point for an isotonic or iso-osmolal electrolyte solution.
- Saline 0.9% has a theoretical osmolarity of 308 mOsmol/l (1⁄4154 mmol/l Na + 154 mmol/l Cl) or an actual (real) osmolality of 286 mOsmol/kg H2O (=theoretical osmolarity 308 mOsmol/l x osmotic coefficient 0.926/water content 0.997).
	- The difference can be explained by the fact that a part of the electrolytes infused are not osmotically effective because of absorption on proteins and cell membranes.
- Compared with plasma and ECF, Ringer’s lactate (=Hartmann’s) solution is somewhat hypotonic (276 instead of 308 mOsmol/l or 256 instead of 288 mOsmol/kg H2O), while saline 0.9% or Ringer’s solution contain too much chloride (154 instead of 95–106mmol/l)
	- Infusion of large volumes may reduce the osmolality or result in hyperchloraemic acidosis.
- The potential base excess (BEpot) of an electrolyte solution indicates the amount of HCO3 that can potentially be released in the body after metabolization of the anions infused (e.g. acetate, lactate, malate).
	- A solution with BEpot less than 0 mmol/l --> acidotic effect
	- A solution with BEpot greater than 0 mmol/l --> alkalotic effect
	- A solution with BEpot = 0 mmol/l --> no effect on the patient’s acid-base balance.
- As compared with lactate, acetate metabolism is:
	- significantly faster
	- more independent of hepatic function
	- lower increase in oxygen consumption
	- no interference with the diagnostic use of lactate as a marker of low tissue perfusion.
- In case of preexisting imbalances, balanced isotonic electrolyte solutions shift the status more towards the normal range.
- Acetatecontaining balanced isotonic electrolyte solutions are also compatible with most anaesthetic drugs except:
	- phenytoin
	- diazepam
## Preoperative Fasting

- Excessive fasting is common in children presenting for surgery.
- Prolonged preoperative fasting times were associated with ketoacidosis
	- optimized pre-operative fasting times:
		- decreased the ketone body concentration
		- decreased the incidence of hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure <40 mmHg) after induction of anaesthesia in children younger than 3 years of age.
- Shortened fasting times for clear fluids until the children are called to theatre improved the perioperative experience for parents and children without increasing the incidence of pulmonary aspiration
	- 1 h of clear fluid fasting did not alter gastric pH or residual volume compared with 2 h of fasting.
	- Consensus statement advocates reducing the fasting time for clear fluids from 2 to 1 h.
- In the guidelines for perioperative fluid therapy in children by the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany, it is recommended that perioperative intravenous fluid therapy should not necessarily be performed in children with short fasting times beyond neonatal age undergoing short (<1 h) and nonbleeding procedures.
## Perioperative Fluid Management in Neonates
- The perioperative use of hypotonic electrolyte or electrolyte-free glucose-containing solutions is still common during neonatal surgery.
- The combined effects of perioperative hypotonic fluids and ADH on water reabsorption in the kidney may lead to a decrease in plasma sodium concentration.
	- The calculated free water intake correlates with the decrease in sodium concentration during neonatal surgery.
	- The routine use of hypotonic electrolyte solutions during neonatal surgery should be questioned.
	- In an observational study, the intraoperative infusion of 10 ml/kg/h of a balanced isotonic electrolyte solution with glucose 1% was associated with stable sodium and glucose concentrations in neonates.
	- Datta et al. compared the effects of an intraoperative infusion of 10 ml/kg/h of glucose 1% and 2% in Ringer’s lactate in neonates with a low body weight of 1.6–2.8 kg.
		- The solutions were equally effective in maintaining glucose homeostasis but the glucose solution with a higher concentration inhibited:
			- catabolism
			- insulin resistance
			- rebound hyperglycaemia
			- acidosis
	- Special care must be taken when administering electrolyte-free concentrated glucose solution:
		- accidental hyperinfusion may result in hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic coma.
## Saline 0.9% and Hyperchloraemic Acidosis
- Saline 0.9% is still widely used because of its relatively safe profile and its low cost.
- It avoids the risk of hyponatraemia, but it contains too much chloride and no bicarbonate precursor.
- Infusion of high volumes may cause chloride overload leading to a suppression of renal blood flow and the renin–aldosterone system and hyperchloraemic acidosis.
- Studies including children undergoing major paediatric surgery and neurosurgery showed similar results.
- Isotonic electrolyte solutions should be preferred because of their resemblance to extracellular fluid.
## Postoperative Management
- Short fasting times and early drinking as wanted by the children should be favoured postoperatively.
- For maintenance infusions in postoperative or nonsurgical patients, randomized clinical studies and meta-analyses showed a lower incidence of hyponatraemia when using isotonic instead of hypotonic electrolyte solutions with glucose 5%.
- In line with the above considerations, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends in a recently published guideline that patients 28 days to 18 years of age requiring maintenance intravenous fluids should receive isotonic solutions with appropriate potassium chloride and dextrose as they significantly decrease the risk of developing hyponatraemia (evidence quality: A; recommendation strength: strong).
