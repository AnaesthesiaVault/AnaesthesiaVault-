# Classification of Congenital Heart Disease According to Physiology

## 1. Normal or Series Circulation
- **Normal circulation**
- **Repaired congenital heart disease (CHD)**
- **"Normal" circulation with small shunts**
## 2. Balanced or Parallel Circulation

In balanced or parallel circulation, blood flow to the systemic and pulmonary circulations depends on the balance between pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Examples include:

- **Large atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) or ventricular septal defect (VSD)**
- **Blalock-Taussig shunt**
- **Truncus arteriosus**
- **Hypoplastic left heart syndrome**
## 3. Single Ventricle Circulation

Single ventricle circulation refers to palliation for uncorrectable congenital heart disease, typically managed in a three-stage correction process:

### Three-Stage Correction
1. **Blalock-Taussig shunt**: A connection is created between the pulmonary artery (PA) and the aorta, similar to a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).
2. **Glenn shunt**: A connection between the superior vena cava and the right pulmonary artery. The PDA or Blalock-Taussig shunt is ligated.
3. **Fontan procedure**: The inferior vena cava is connected to the right pulmonary artery, achieving total cavo-pulmonary connection.
### Considerations
- Increased pulmonary vascular resistance and intrathoracic pressure can compromise pulmonary blood flow.
- **Spontaneous breathing** improves pulmonary blood flow via negative intrathoracic pressure but limits control of oxygenation and mechanical ventilation (MV).
- **Positive pressure ventilation** offers better control of oxygenation and MV, avoiding hypoxia and hypercapnia. However, it increases intrathoracic pressure, so it is critical to optimize positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), minimize peak inspiratory pressures, and reduce inspiratory time to mitigate this.
# Aetiology of Congenital Heart Disease

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common form of congenital disease, with an incidence of approximately 8 per 1000 live births (nearly 1%).

## Multifactorial Causes (mostly unknown), including
- **Prematurity** (e.g., patent ductus arteriosus)
- **Perinatal infections** (e.g., STORCH infections)
- **Alcohol abuse** (e.g., septal defects)
- **Maternal drug exposure** (e.g., lithium), maternal diseases (e.g., diabetes), or radiation exposure.
- **Chromosomal abnormalities**:
	- **Down syndrome (Trisomy 21)**: associated with endocardial cushion defects or VSD.
	- **DiGeorge syndrome (CATCH 22)**: associated with cyanotic cardiac abnormalities, abnormal facies, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate, cognitive impairment, hypocalcaemia, and abnormalities of chromosome 22.
	- **Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)** and **Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome)**
	- **Turner syndrome (45, X0)**: associated with coarctation of the aorta.
# Fetal Cardiac Physiology
## Pulmonary Vascular Bed Reactivity
- **Pulmonary vascular bed** is highly reactive in infants. At birth, infants have relatively high pulmonary hypertension (PHT), which decreases to below systemic vascular resistance (SVR) at 24 hours of life. Adult levels of PVR are reached by 2 years of age, and the muscularis layer of pulmonary arteries continues to thin until approximately 5 years. Infants are therefore sensitive to triggers for increased PHT and may experience exaggerated responses.
## Characteristics of the Newborn Heart
- **Myocyte composition**: The neonatal heart has fewer myocytes and a greater proportion of connective tissue compared to an adult heart. In neonates, 2/3 of the myocyte cell consists of non-contractile elements (compared to 1/3 in adults).
- **Contractile elements**: The neonatal heart has fewer contractile elements, making it highly sensitive to increases in afterload and resulting in lower compliance.
- **Sympathetic innervation**: Immature sympathetic innervation (fewer nerves, reduced norepinephrine/adrenaline release) leads to increased dependence on circulating catecholamines.
- **Parasympathetic system**: Fully developed at birth, leading to "vagal dominance."
- **Starling curve**: The plateau of the Starling curve is shifted leftward, with the newborn heart functioning near the peak of the curve, which gives it a relatively fixed stroke volume. This makes pediatric hearts highly sensitive to excessive preload.
- **Cardiac output**: In neonates, cardiac output is heart rate-dependent due to the limited ability to modulate stroke volume.
## Calcium Handling
- **Calcium source**: In neonates, a significant proportion of activator calcium is derived from the extracellular pool rather than the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as seen in mature hearts. This makes neonatal myocytes highly sensitive to decreases in free ionized calcium or calcium channel blockade.
## Response to Hypoxia
- The neonatal heart is more resistant to hypoxia compared to older children and adults.
- **Preterm infants** are more sensitive to the depressant effects of volatile anaesthetics.
## Blood Pressure as a Volume Indicator
- In neonates, blood pressure is a reliable indicator of volume status and is closely monitored during anesthesia and critical care.
# General Approach to Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)
## Key Points
- **Scope of procedures**: Curative, corrective, or palliative interventions.
- **Anaesthetic plan**: Develop an individualized anaesthetic plan using a cardiac grid of goals.
## A. Suspecting CHD in a Baby or Child
### Spectrum of Presentation
- **Urgent**: Very sick neonates requiring immediate intervention.
- **Incidental**: Older children with good cardiac function where CHD is discovered incidentally.
### Common Symptoms and Signs of CHD
- **Hypoxaemia/cyanosis**:
  - Peripheral cyanosis: Indicates regional hypoperfusion.
  - Central cyanosis: May indicate a cardiac or pulmonary origin.
- **Heart failure (HF)**: Signs include systemic and/or pulmonary congestion or systemic hypoperfusion (e.g., cardiogenic shock). In neonates, symptoms include:
  - Poor feeding with failure to thrive (FTT).
  - Sweating during feeds.
  - Tachypnoea, tachycardia (with or without gallop rhythm).
  - Recurrent chest infections.
  - Poor peripheral perfusion (cold, clammy skin, poor pulse volume).
  - Hepatomegaly.
- **Heart murmur**: Pathological murmurs include:
  - Diastolic murmurs.
  - Pansystolic murmurs (common in VSDs).
  - Late systolic or continuous murmurs (except venous hum).
  - Murmurs associated with a thrill.
- **Hypertension**: Differential blood pressures in arms and legs may suggest aortic coarctation.
- **Dysrhythmias** or **sudden cardiac death (SCD)**.
- **Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)**.
- **Infective endocarditis (IE)**.
- **Associated congenital abnormalities**: Syndromes such as Down's, DiGeorge, etc., raise suspicion for CHD in syndromic/dysmorphic children.
## B. Making an Accurate Diagnosis
### Steps in Diagnosis
- **Clinical examination**: Assess for signs of hypoxaemia, heart failure, murmurs, etc.
- **Laboratory tests**: Full blood count (FBC), electrolytes (U+E), INR, aPTT, platelet function studies.
- **ECG**: Evaluate for rhythm abnormalities and structural concerns.
- **Imaging**:
  - Chest X-ray (CXR), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
  - Oximetry and blood gases to assess oxygenation.
  - Echocardiogram: Provides information on structural heart disease.
  - Cardiac catheterization with or without angiography: Offers detailed anatomical data, pressure measurements, and oxygen saturation levels in heart chambers and vessels.
### Classify the Defect
- Based on clinical and diagnostic findings, classify the CHD into one of the standard categories (e.g., acyanotic, cyanotic, shunt defects, obstructive lesions).
## C. Understanding the Anatomy, Pathophysiology, and Problems of the Defect
- Use the investigations mentioned in section B to visualize and understand the anatomy of the defect.
- **Describe** the defect in detail, including drawing a diagram if needed.
- **Key elements to assess**:
  - **Source, reliability, and volume of pulmonary blood flow**.
  - **Venous drainage and arterial outflow**: Consider how blood flows through the heart as if you were a red blood cell, focusing on oxygenation pathways.
## D. Surgical Procedures
- **Curative**: Procedures that aim to completely correct the defect.
- **Corrective**: Procedures that alleviate some aspects of the defect, improving function.
- **Palliative**: Procedures that offer temporary or incomplete solutions, often part of staged repairs.
## E. Peri-operative Management Plan (Cardiac Grid)

Develop a plan that addresses stabilization and peri-operative management, especially for very sick neonates.

### Recurring Themes in CHD Management
1. **Avoid bubbles in IV lines**: Due to the risk of systemic embolism via shunts.
2. **Infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis**: Administer antibiotics as indicated.
3. **Managing hypoxaemia/cyanosis/cyanotic spells**:
   - Administer oxygen and ventilate to maintain normocarbia.
   - Correct acidosis using bicarbonate.
   - Increase systemic vascular resistance (SVR) via knee-chest position, femoral compression, fluid bolus, or phenylephrine.
   - Reduce inotropy in cases of infundibular spasm (using beta-blockers, opioids, or volatile anaesthetics).
   - Optimize oxygen delivery to vital organs (DO₂ = systemic ventricular output × arterial oxygen content).
   - **Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)** may be needed to keep the ductus arteriosus (DA) open if ductal-dependent blood flow is required.
   - Manipulate systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances to improve pulmonary blood flow.
   - **Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)** may be necessary for severe defects.
   - Maintain a haematocrit (PCV) of 50-60% for cyanotic infants.
4. **Managing heart failure**:
   - Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), digoxin, inotropes, and antidysrhythmics as needed.
5. **Managing pulmonary hypertension (PHT)**:
   - Maintain contractility of both ventricles.
   - Reduce right ventricular (RV) afterload by treating hypoxia, hypercarbia, hypothermia, and acidosis. Maintain optimal lung volumes without excessive positive pressure ventilation (PPV).
   - Consider pulmonary vasodilators such as oxygen, sildenafil, nitric oxide, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), nitrates, nitroprusside, prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), bosentan, milrinone, and others.
6. **Managing hyperviscosity**:
   - Maintain PCV of 50-60%. If PCV exceeds 60-65%, consider venesection to improve systemic blood flow and oxygen delivery.
   - Ensure adequate hydration.
7. **Managing coagulopathy**:
   - Administer vitamin K, platelet, and/or factor replacement as needed. Ensure blood products are available.
8. **Treating shock/hypoperfusion**:
   - Administer IV fluid boluses and inotropes.
   - Use PGE1 if the neonate is dependent on the ductus arteriosus for systemic blood flow.
9. **Managing hypertension** (e.g., following correction of coarctation):
   - Treat with diuretics, labetalol, nitrates, or nitroprusside.

# Classification of Congenital Heart Defects

## Incidence of Common Defects

Nine lesions account for over 80% of congenital heart defects (CHDs):

1. **Ventricular septal defect (VSD)**–35%
2. **Atrial septal defect (ASD)**–10%
3. **Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)**–10%
4. **Pulmonary stenosis (PS)**–7%
5. **Congenital aortic stenosis (AS)**–7%
6. **Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)**–7%
7. **Coarctation of the aorta**–7%
8. **Transposition of the great arteries (TGA)**–4%
9. **Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)**–3%
10. **Other defects** (~15%):
   - Pulmonary atresia
   - Tricuspid atresia
   - Total/partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (TAPVD)
   - Truncus arteriosus
   - Double aortic arch (vascular ring abnormalities)
   - Single ventricle (univentricular heart)
   - Double outlet right ventricle (DORV)
   - Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)
   - Ebstein’s anomaly
   - Anomalous origin of coronary arteries
## Functional Classification of Congenital Heart Defects
### 1. Lesions Causing Outflow Obstruction
- **Left ventricle (LV)**:
   - Aortic stenosis (AS)
   - Coarctation of the aorta
- **Right ventricle (RV)**:
   - Pulmonary stenosis (PS)
### 2. Shunts

Shunts are characterized by abnormal blood flow between the left and right sides of the heart. Shunts may be classified as **simple** or **complex**:

#### Simple Shunts
- A hole in the heart between the left and right sides, with blood flow dependent on the relative resistances of the systemic and pulmonary circulations.
- **Types of Simple Shunts**:
   - **Restrictive**: Small defect determines the amount of blood flow.
   - **Less restrictive**: Larger defect allows more flow.
   - **Non-restrictive**: Blood flow is entirely determined by the relative vascular resistances of the pulmonary and systemic circulations.
#### Complex Shunts
- A simple shunt combined with another abnormality (e.g., VSD + PS), reducing control over blood flow direction.
### 3. Shunts Classified by Flow Direction
#### A. Left-to-Right Shunts
- **Acyanotic** unless Eisenmenger’s syndrome develops.
- Characterized by increased pulmonary blood flow.
- Examples:
   - VSD
   - ASD
   - PDA
   - Endocardial cushion defect (AVSD)
   - Partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage
#### B. Right-to-Left Shunts
- **Potentially cyanotic**, though not necessarily all the time.
##### Right-to-left Shunts with **increased Pulmonary Blood flow**
- Usually less cyanotic or cyanotic only at certain times.
- Examples:
   - **Transposition of the great arteries (TGA)**: Requires ASD, VSD, or PDA to survive.
   - **Truncus arteriosus**
   - **Single ventricle (univentricular heart)**
   - **Double outlet right ventricle (DORV)**
   - **Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (TAPVD)**: Requires ASD to survive.
   - **Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)**
##### Right-to-left Shunts with **decreased Pulmonary Blood flow**
- More severely cyanotic.
- Examples:
   - **Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)**
   - **Pulmonary atresia**: Requires a shunting lesion to survive.
   - **Tricuspid atresia**: Requires a shunting lesion to survive.
   - **Ebstein’s anomaly**: Associated with regurgitant lesions.
   - **Single ventricle (certain variations)**
### 4. Mixing Lesions
- Lesions in *italics* are often classified as "mixing lesions", where the ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow is independent of the size of the shunt and instead depends on vascular resistances or outflow obstruction.
- In these lesions, pulmonary and systemic circulations are in **parallel**, rather than in series, as seen in normal circulation.
   - *TGA, Truncus arteriosus, Single ventricle, TAPVD, HLHS*
  ![[Pasted image 20230813121019.png]]
# Cyanosis
- **Definition**: Cyanosis is a bluish or purplish discoloration of the skin or mucous membranes, caused by an excess of reduced hemoglobin (>5 g/dl deoxyhemoglobin) in blood vessels.
   - **Peripheral cyanosis**: Due to poor perfusion.
   - **Central cyanosis**: Due to reduced arterial oxygen saturation, visible in the tongue or buccal mucosa, and usually accompanied by peripheral cyanosis.
- **Hypoxaemia**: Defined as a PaO₂ < 8 kPa.
### Hemoglobin and Cyanosis
- **Anemia**: A child with low hemoglobin (e.g., Hb = 6 g/dl) may be hypoxaemic but not appear cyanotic, as there isn't enough deoxyhemoglobin to reach the visible threshold.
- **Polycythemia**: A child with high hemoglobin (e.g., Hb = 22 g/dl) may appear cyanotic due to excess deoxyhemoglobin, even if oxygen delivery (DO₂) is adequate.
### Differentiating Cardiac and Respiratory Causes of Hypoxaemia
- **Hyperoxic test**: Administer 100% oxygen. If PaO₂ improves (>13 kPa), the cause is likely respiratory. If it remains low, it suggests a cardiac shunt.
# Generic Consequences of Various Lesions in CHD

Understanding the anatomical and physiological impact of a congenital heart defect (CHD) is critical for management. CHD can present in infancy, childhood, or adulthood.

## Common Consequences for All Lesions
- **Infective endocarditis (IE)** risk.
- **Paradoxical embolization**.
- **Arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD)** risk.
## Obstructive Lesions
### Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) (e.g., Pulmonary Stenosis)
- **Consequences**:
   - Right heart failure (RHF).
   - Dyspnoea and cyanosis with exertion (due to fixed cardiac output and possible reopening of the foramen ovale).
   - Syncope during exertion (cardiac output cannot be maintained as stroke volume (SV) is relatively fixed, and systemic blood pressure (SBP) drops if systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreases).
- **Anaesthetic considerations**:
   - Maintain good preload, but avoid volume overload.
   - Avoid factors that increase pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR): Maintain normoxia, normocarbia, avoid acidosis, excessive PEEP, high or low lung volumes, and hypothermia.
### Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) (e.g., Aortic Stenosis)
- **Consequences**:
   - Low cardiac output (CO).
   - Myocardial ischemia and fibrosis, leading to left heart failure (LHF).
## Shunt Lesions
### Increased Pulmonary Flow (L to R Shunts)
- **Consequences**:
   - **Right ventricular volume overload**: Leading to right heart failure (RHF).
   - **Pulmonary hypertension (PHT)**: High pulmonary blood flow leads to PHT as vessels thicken, eventually leading to Eisenmenger syndrome and irreversible damage.
   - **Respiratory complications**: Pulmonary oedema, reduced lung compliance (CL), increased work of breathing, decreased functional residual capacity (FRC), and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, increasing respiratory infections and hypoxaemia.
#### Medical Treatment
   - Diuretics (risk of hypokalaemia, hypovolaemia).
   - ACE inhibitors.
   - Digoxin.
   - Inotropes.
#### Anaesthetic Considerations
   - **Induction**: Faster gas induction claimed due to rapid equilibration between alveolar and blood partial pressures, but the increased pulmonary blood flow slows equilibration.
   - **IV drug effects**: May have slower onset due to drug recirculation through the lungs, where drugs (e.g., fentanyl) are metabolized or sequestered.
   - **Anaesthesia goals**:
	  - Avoid worsening the L to R shunt.
	  - Modest reduction in SVR is well tolerated.
	  - Volatile anaesthetics (iso, sevo, desflurane) are generally tolerated due to their vasodilatory effects.
	  - Maintain right ventricular contractility, and avoid volume overload.
### Decreased Pulmonary Flow (R to L Shunts)
- **Consequences**:
   - Blood bypasses the lungs, leading to hypoxaemia, cyanosis, and metabolic acidosis.
   - **Ductus arteriosus (DA)** may need to remain open in duct-dependent lesions (maintained with **prostaglandin E1**).
   - **Clubbing** and **polycythaemia** result from chronic hypoxaemia.
   - **Hyperviscosity syndrome**: Fatigue, muscle weakness, headache, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), often precipitated by dehydration.
   - **Thrombosis risk**: Paradoxical embolism and strokes are more common.
   - **Coagulopathy**: Platelet and clotting factor defects.
   - **Renal impairment**: Caused by thrombotic complications.
#### Medical Treatment
   - Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) to maintain ductal patency.
   - Propranolol for tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) spells.
   - Phlebotomy if hematocrit (Hct) > 65%.
#### Anaesthetic Considerations
   - **Induction**: Inhalational induction is slower due to reduced pulmonary blood flow (which dilutes alveolar partial pressure).
   - **IV drug effects**: Faster onset as the drug bypasses the lungs, requiring smaller doses.
   - **End-expiratory CO₂** consistently underestimates true PaCO₂.
#### Anaesthetic Aims
1. **Maintain systemic oxygen delivery (DO₂)**:
   - Adequate oxygenation (FiO₂).
   - Maintain systemic blood flow (Qs) by balancing pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances (PVR and SVR).
   - Avoid increasing PVR (limit positive pressure ventilation (PPV), maintain normocarbia).
   - Use ketamine for anaesthesia, as it increases SVR and maintains cardiac output.
2. **Treat cyanotic spells** (Tetralogy of Fallot):
   - Increase SVR (knee-chest position, phenylephrine).
   - Reduce infundibular spasm (halothane, opioids, beta-blockers).
   - Use 100% oxygen to reduce PVR and treat acidosis.
# Surgical Procedures for CHD
## Lesions with **Increased Pulmonary Blood Flow (Left-to-Right Shunts)**
- **Goal**: Decrease pulmonary blood flow to protect the pulmonary vasculature from damage caused by overcirculation.
### Surgical Interventions
1. **Repair of Defects**:
	- **Ventricular septal defect (VSD)**
	- **Atrial septal defect (ASD)**
	- **Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)**
	- **Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)**
2. **Pulmonary Artery Banding**:
	- A palliative procedure to reduce excessive blood flow to the lungs by placing a band around the pulmonary artery.
	- Band tightening should continue until:
		- Oxygen saturation falls by 2%.
		- Aortic pressure increases.
		- Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) decreases to <50% of systemic blood pressure.
		- If saturations are stable, the band can be tightened further, aiming for 30% of systemic blood pressure.
## Lesions with **Decreased Pulmonary Blood Flow (Right-to-Left Shunts)**
- **Goal**: Increase pulmonary blood flow to improve oxygenation.
### Surgical Interventions
1. **Shunts to Increase Pulmonary Blood Flow**:

	- **Blalock-Taussig shunt**: Connects the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery to increase pulmonary flow.
	- **Modified Blalock-Taussig shunt**: A synthetic graft is used between the subclavian artery and pulmonary artery.
	- **Waterston, Potts, and Central Shunts**: Aorto-pulmonary shunts used to increase pulmonary flow.
2. **Shunts to Increase Pulmonary Flow Using Venous Pressure (Cavo-Pulmonary Shunts)**:
	- Used when pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is low, redirecting venous blood into the pulmonary circulation.
	- **Glenn procedure**: Superior vena cava (SVC) is connected to the right pulmonary artery (unidirectional or bidirectional).
	- **Fontan procedure**: Total cavo-pulmonary connection where both the SVC and inferior vena cava (IVC) are connected to the pulmonary arteries.
### Dangers of Cavo-Pulmonary Shunts
- **Venous pressure** drives blood into the pulmonary arteries, so the presence of pulmonary hypertension (PHT) can lead to lethal complications.
- **Complications from venous hypertension**:
	- Pleural effusions.
	- Pericardial effusions.
	- Ascites.
	- Protein-losing enteropathy and chylothorax (due to lymphatic drainage into veins).
	- Increased risk of thromboembolism due to venous stasis.
## Lesions with **High Pulmonary Flow and the Need for Increased Systemic-Venous Mixing**
- **Goal**: Improve systemic oxygenation by increasing the mixing of systemic venous blood with pulmonary blood, particularly in conditions like **Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA)**.
### Surgical Interventions
1. **Atrial Septostomy (Rashkind Procedure)**:
	- A balloon catheter is used to create or enlarge an atrial septal defect (ASD) to allow better mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood at the atrial level, essential in TGA for survival.
# Different Types of CHD
## Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)

- Commonest CHD (35%), L-R lesion (acyanotic).
![[Pasted image 20230813142524.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230813142815.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230813142904.png]]

## Overview
- **Most common congenital heart disease (CHD)**, accounting for ~35% of cases.
- **Shunt type**: Left-to-right shunt (acyanotic).
### Classification of VSDs
1. **Membranous septum (70%)**:
   - Located in the left ventricular outflow tract just below the aortic valve.
   - Also called infracristal or perimembranous VSD.
   
2. **Muscular septum (20%)**:
   - Often multiple defects within the muscular portion of the septum.

3. **Subpulmonary (5-8%)**:
   - Deficiency in the conal septum.
   - Also called supracristal, conal, infundibular, or subarterial VSD.
   - Associated with aortic regurgitation due to prolapse of the right aortic cusp.

4. **AV canal type (8-10%)**:
   - Deficiency of the endocardial cushion component of the interventricular septum.
   - Also known as posterior, endocardial cushion-type, or inlet VSD.
   - Located posterior to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve.

5. **Malalignment defects**:
   - **Anterior malalignment**: Causes subpulmonary obstruction and is associated with **tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)**.
   - **Posterior malalignment**: Causes subaortic obstruction and can be associated with **coarctation of the aorta** or **interrupted aortic arch**.

6. **Acquired VSD**:
   - Occurs post-myocardial infarction or other myocardial damage.
## Pathophysiology
- **Left-to-right shunting** leading to pulmonary hypertension (PHT) and heart failure (HF) due to volume overload.
- The impact of the defect depends on:
  - **Size of the defect**.
  - The ratio of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) to systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (Rp:Rs).
### Types of VSD
- **Small, restrictive VSD**:
  - Often asymptomatic; 50% close spontaneously by 5 years of age.
  
- **Non-restrictive VSD**:
  - Left-to-right shunt magnitude depends on the Rp:Rs ratio.
## Diagnosis
- **Small VSD**: Asymptomatic.
- **Large VSD**: Symptoms of HF, including tachypnoea, poor feeding, failure to thrive (FTT), and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Complications include Eisenmenger syndrome (cyanosis) and infective endocarditis (IE).
- **Physical signs**:
  - Volume-loaded, displaced apex.
  - Systolic thrill at the left sternal edge (3rd-4th intercostal space) ± right ventricular (RV) heave (suggesting PHT).
### Investigations
- **Chest X-ray**:
  - Normal or with large VSD: Enlarged left atrium (LA), left and right ventricular cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary vascularity.
  - In PHT: Enlarged pulmonary artery with distal pruning.
- **ECG**:
  - P-mitrale (LA enlargement), left or right ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, RVH)
- **Echocardiogram (Echo)**:
  - Colour Doppler to assess the magnitude and direction of the shunt.
- **Cardiac catheterization**:
  - Increased PvO₂ in RV compared to RA confirms left-to-right shunting.
### Murmur
- **Holosystolic, harsh, "tearing" murmur** at the left sternal border, loudest with a small defect.
- **Apical mid-diastolic rumble** due to increased mitral valve flow.
- **Loud P2** (suggesting PHT), with exaggerated inspiratory splitting.
## Treatment
1. **Follow-up**: Regular monitoring, with IE prophylaxis for certain procedures.
2. **Medical management**:
   - Digoxin and diuretics (e.g., furosemide).
3. **Surgical intervention**:
   - Indicated for failure to thrive, recurrent LRTIs, congestive heart failure (CCF), or if symptomatic beyond 5 years of age.
   - **Surgical options**:
	 - Pulmonary artery (PA) banding (to reduce pulmonary blood flow).
	 - VSD repair with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
## Anaesthetic Principles
### General Considerations
- **Infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis**: Follow new guidelines (not always required for VSD).
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Inhaled agents are generally unaffected; IV agents may have slower effects.
- **Monitoring**: ECG, BP, SpO₂, ETCO₂, CVP, temperature, urine output, blood gases.
- **Risks**: Air embolism, reversal of shunt in PHT, right heart failure (RHF).
### Anaesthetic Management for **Left-to-Right Shunt**
- **Induction**:
  - Both gas and IV induction are suitable.
  - Aim not to worsen the shunt; moderate reduction of pulmonary blood flow (Qp) is desired to prevent RV overload.
- **Key parameters**:
  - **Preload**: Avoid fluid overload.
  - **SVR**: Moderate reduction is beneficial (switch from halothane to isoflurane).
  - **PVR**: Keep moderately low. Normocarbia is ideal (hyperventilation causes pulmonary vasodilation, increasing Qp).
  - **Heart rate**: Maintain normal heart rate.
  - **Contractility**: Maintain contractility; may require inotropes.
### Anaesthetic Management for **Right-to-Left Shunt with PHT and RHF (Eisenmenger Syndrome)**
- **Induction**:
  - Use **fentanyl** or **ketamine**; avoid volatile agents (sevoflurane is preferred if necessary due to less cardiac suppression).
  - Expect rapid onset of IV agents and slower onset with inhalational agents.
- **Key parameters**:
  - **Preload**: Sensitive to overor under-filling.
  - **SVR**: Keep elevated (ketamine helps by increasing SVR and blocking norepinephrine reuptake).
  - **PVR**: Minimize PVR by avoiding hypoxia, acidosis, hypothermia, and excessive PEEP.
  - **Heart rate**: Maintain normal heart rate.
  - **Contractility**: Maintain contractility; may require inotropes.
## Post-Operative Complications
- **Heart block**: Due to damaged conduction tissue or oedema.
- **Contractile dysfunction**: Particularly after ventriculotomy, often requiring temporary inotropes.
- **Residual shunt**: May require further intervention.
- **Ventilation**: Early extubation if uncomplicated; prolonged ventilation if there is PHT or other complications.

## Atrial Septal Defect

- L to R lesion, acyanotic.
### Classification
1. Ostium secundum ASD = commonest (90%). One or more defects in septum primum near foramen ovale.
2. Ostium primum ASD = failure of septum primum to fuse with endocardial cushions. At the inferior portion of interatrial septum and associated with abnormalities of mitral and tricuspid valves.
3. Sinus venosus ASD = incomplete absorption of sinus venosus into RA. Associated with partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (of right pulmonary veins into RA).
4. Patent foramen ovale = 30% of adults the septum primum “flap” not fused to septum secundum and just a flap functionally closing foramen ovale by LA pressure > RA pressure. Only important if PHT with risk of paradoxical emboli.
![[Pasted image 20230813144043.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230813144117.png]]
### Pathophysiology
- L to R shunt (acyanotic) with ↑ pulmonary flow.
 ![[Pasted image 20230813144155.png]]
- **Flow through the ASD depends on:** Size of ASD; Relative pressures in the atria (which depends on relative compliance of the two ventricles; normally lower right, therefore L to R flow).
- **↑Pulmonary flow:** Volume overload of RA + RV and enlargement of RA + RV
- **Complicated in:** ↑Pulmonary infections; Pulm vascular changes + PHT; Eisenmenger (hypoxaemia + cyanosis); Paradoxical emboli; RHF

### Diagnosis
#### Symptoms
- Asymptomatic
- Dyspnoea on exertion + fatigue
- Recurrent LRTI
- Palpitations (arrhythmias from enlarged RA)
#### Signs
- RV heave (sternal / left sternal border)
- Fixed splitting S2 (inspiration and expiration). Due to high flow to right heart and respiratory pressure fluctuations transmitted to both sides so that SV varies in same way.
- ASD causes no sound but ↑↑ flow R. side of heart so:
- Mid-diastolic tricuspid high flow murmur at left lower sternal border (louder on inspiration).
- Pulmonary systolic ejection flow murmur at 2nd space left sternal border also louder on inspiration.
- Audio: http://depts.washington.edu/physdx/heart/demo.html
#### Other
- Not increased IE risk unless valvular abnormalities (mitral prolapsed or valve cleft).
#### CXR
- RV + RA enlargement. Prominent pulmonary artery. Pulmonary plethora (pruning when PHT).
![[Pasted image 20230813144719.png]]
#### ECG
- P-pulmonale or RA enlargement.
- RVH Volt criteria (dominant R in V1, prominent S in V6);
- Clockwise rotation of heart (equiphasic point from V3 towards V5 direction).
- RAD
- S1, S2, S3 syndrome = prominent S waves in S1,2 and 3.
- RV strain pattern (inverted T waves, depressed ST segments in V1, V2 +/- V3).
- RA enlargement (P-pulmonale);
- RBBB (large Pulm embolism), sudden AF, SIQIIITIII syndrome (deep S wave in SI, Q wave and inverted T wave in SIII) in pulmonary embolism.
![[Pasted image 20230813145054.png]]

### Treatment
- None if minor. Most close spontaneously if ASD < 8 mm.
- Qp 1,5x greater than Qs. Close surgically (on CPB or catheter based procedure using an Amplatzer device under echo guidance.
### Anaesthesia Management
- L to R shunt with ↑ pulmonary flow
-Remember effect on pharmacokinetics of inhalationals and IV’s.
-Remember the generic consequences of L to R shunts.
-IE prophylaxis if valvular abnormalities.
-No bubbles in lines.
-Don’t worsen L to R shunt
![[Pasted image 20230813145327.png]]

## Patent Ductus Arteriosis

- L to R lesion, acyanotic.
- DA fails to close after birth (which normally happens due to the increased oxygen tension together with an increase in the ratio of PGF2α/PGE1. Initially muscular constriction, later fibrosis by 2-3 weeks permanently closes it).
### Risk Factors

First trimester maternal rubella infection; Prematurity; Neonatal lung disease (e.g. RDS); Birth at high altitudes.

### Pathophysiology
- Persistent shunt between descending aorta and left pulmonary artery.
- **Magnitude of shunt depends on**: Cross-sectional area; Length of DA. Relative resistances of the systemic and pulmonary vasculatures
- Prenatally ↑PVR results in blood being diverted to the aorta. As pulmonary resistance drops postnatally, the shunt reverses direction and blood flows from aorta into the pulmonary circulation instead.
- L to R shunt results in volume overload of pulmonary circulation, LA and LV (see below) with risk of LV dilatation and LHF. Right heart remains normal unless pulmonary vascular disease (with ↑PVR) develops (in which case Eisenmenger physiology can result with cyanosis of feet but not the upper extremities).
![[Pasted image 20230813145756.png]]
### Diagnosis
#### Symptoms
- Asymptomatic if small.
- Large L toR shunt: Early CHF with tachycardia, poor feeding, slow growth, recurrent LRTI’s (a feature of any situation with high lung flow and high lung water).
- Moderate size: Fatigue, dyspnoea and palpitations in adolescence / adults.
#### Signs
- AF (LA dilatation). Tachycardia, bounding pulses (wide pulse pressure), hyperactive precordium.
- Infective endocarditis (actually called an endarteritis in the DA).
- **Murmur:** Continuous machine-like murmur maximal left subclavicular, present throughout cardiac cycle (since pressure gradient is always present). The murmur becomes softer and the diastolic component may disappear if pulmonary vascular disease develops leading to decreased flow through the PDA.
- Audio: http://depts.washington.edu/physdx/heart/demo.html
![[Pasted image 20230813150026.png]]
### Investigations
#### CXR
- Transverse cardiomegaly (enlarged LA, LV with prominent pulmonary vascular markings = pulmonary plethora).
- Calcification of ductus sometimes visible in adults.
#### ECG
- LA enlargement and LVH.
#### Echocardiography
- Can visualize defect and demonstrate flow though it with Doppler and estimate right-sided systolic pressures.
#### Cardiac Catheterization
- Not necessary but shows step-up in oxygen saturation in the pulmonary artery compared with the RV and angiography shows flow through PDA.
### Treatment
- Give a few months to close spontaneously if asymptomatic (rarely closes spontaneously after first months)
- Indomethacin or ibuprofen can be given to aid closure (decreases PGE1). In prem, correct anaemia, sepsis, hypoxia and volume overload (diuretics and fluid restriction helpful) first, then give antiprostaglandin drugs if no contraindications (RF, NEC, low platelets, bleeding).
- Transcatheter occlusion (coil or amplatzer device if large) under general anaesthetic with fluoroscopic guidance.
- Surgical division via left thoracotomy if medical treatment fails or is contraindicated (always closed due to risk of endocarditis). Watch for bradycardia when they clamp it.
- *Of course, don’t close if other cardiac defects that need it for survival!*
## Atrioventicular Septal Defect (AVSD)

- Endocardial cushion defect = atrioventricular canal defect = common atrioventricular canal. L to R defect.
- The classic defect in infants with Down syndrome (15-20% have AVSD).
### Characteristics
- Failure of fusion of superior and inferior endocardial cushions with the mid portion of the atrial septum and the muscular portion of the ventricular septum.
#### Complete AVSD
-There is an ASD between the atria above the AV canal.
-There is a VSD between the ventricles below the AV canal.
-There is a common AV valve (undivided or common AV canal since the tricuspid and mitral canals did not separate normally). Illustrated in a number of diagrams below.
#### Partial / Incomplete AVSD = Ostium Primum Atrial Septal Defect
-No VSD, mitral and tricuspid valve rings have separated.
-There is an ostium primum septal defect with a cleft in the mitral valve that may cause it to leak.
#### Transitional AVSD
-Similar to complete form with a common AV valve, but the leaflets are stuck to the ventricular septum effectively dividing the valve into two valves and closing most of the VSD. It looks more like a complete AVSD but behaves more like a partial AVSD
![[Pasted image 20230813150606.png]]
### Pathophysiology
- ↑Blood flow to lungs through both the ventricular and atrial components of the defect (L to R shunt).
- The abnormal AV valve invariably leaks and results in congestion of atria.
- LV must pump blood L to R over defect (inefficient recirculation) and systemically this increases LV workload and leads to LHF
- High LV pressure transmitted over defects to lungs + L to R shunt leads to Pulmonary plethora with ↑work of breathing and risk of oedema.
- Pulmonary vascular disease develops
- Congestive HF.
- Pulmonary vascular disease with high PVR limits excessive pulmonary flow and limits signs of CHF (less L to R shunt) eventually leading to reversal and cyanosis (murmur also softer).
### Diagnosis
#### Symptoms
- CHF (Tachypnoea, sweat / tire easily during feeds, failure to thrive). Always screen Down syndrome, even if no symptoms / signs)
#### Signs
- **Heart murmur**: Atypical systolic due to flow through VSD and high flow out pulmonary artery as well as incompetence of AV valve). Often absent at birth, becoming more prominent in first week of life.
- Cyanosis if severe pulmonary vascular disease and reversal of shunt.
- Infective endocarditis.
#### Investigations
##### CXR
- Biventricular cardiomegaly, pulmonary plethora. Can look just like ASD or VSD depending on lesions present.
 ![[Pasted image 20230813151107.png]]
##### ECG
 - Depends on combination of defects involved (only ASD, only VSD or both).
 - Complete type usually has enlargement of all 4 cardiac chambers; partial type may have RVH but also LVH if MR.
##### Echo
- Demonstrates pathology.
##### Catheter
- Not usually needed but shows oxygen step-up at RA level and visualizes shunt
### Treatment
- Treat CHF (lasix, ACEi, digoxin)
- Always require corrective surgery at 3-6 months in complete lesions and 6-18 months for partial defects (depending on severity of lesions) = close septal holes with patches and construction of two separate and competent AV valves using available tissue from the common AV valve.
- High incidence of conduction system damage requiring pacemaker.
- If critically ill may need PA banding followed by later repair.
![[Pasted image 20230813151322.png]]

## Congenital Aortic Stenosis

- Abnormal development of the aortic valve, typically bicuspid, but may have 1, 2, or 3 cusps.
	- Note: Bicuspid valves are not necessarily stenotic. Often, they function normally but may fibrose and calcify over time, becoming a common cause of aortic stenosis (AS) in adults.
- More common in males than females (4:1 ratio).
- 20% of cases present with additional abnormalities, most frequently coarctation of the aorta.
### Pathophysiology
- Narrowing of the valvular orifice, leading to increased left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure, LV hypertrophy (LVH), and possibly post-stenotic dilatation of the aorta (due to the high-velocity jet impacting the vessel wall).
- Left heart failure (HF) may occur in infants with severe stenosis but is rare later in childhood.
### Diagnosis
- **Severe cases in infancy**: Symptoms of heart failure, including tachycardia, tachypnoea, failure to thrive, and poor feeding.
- **Less severe cases**: Typically asymptomatic with a heart murmur being the first clue. Over time, symptoms may develop similarly to adult cases (triad of chest pain, syncope, dyspnoea on exertion).
#### Clinical Features
- **Murmur**: Harsh, crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, most prominent over the aortic area, radiating to the neck. Often preceded by a systolic ejection click, indicating valvular stenosis (usually a bicuspid valve).
	- This murmur is present from birth, unlike murmurs associated with atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which develop as pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) declines.
#### Investigations
- **Chest X-ray (CXR)**: May show an enlarged LV and a dilated ascending aorta. LV enlargement is suggested if there is transverse cardiomegaly with the apex displaced downwards and to the left. Transverse cardiomegaly is diagnosed when the ratio of the maximum transverse diameter of the heart to the maximum width of the thorax (above costophrenic angles) is >50%. This threshold may vary in certain conditions like pectus excavatum.
- **ECG**: Signs of LVH +/- strain patterns.
- **Echocardiography**: Used to assess the valve morphology, pressure gradients across the valve, LVH, and diastolic dysfunction.
- **Exercise stress test**: May be performed to assess the functional impact of stenosis.
![[Pasted image 20230904171155.png]

## Pulmonary Stenosis

- Pulmonary stenosis (PS) can occur at valvular (>90% of cases), subvalvular (obstruction in the right ventricular outflow tract), or supravalvular (in the pulmonary artery itself) levels.
- More common in genetic conditions such as Noonan syndrome and Williams syndrome.
### Pathophysiology
- Obstruction of right ventricular (RV) systolic ejection.
- Increased RV pressures leading to RVH. In rare cases of decompensation, right-sided heart failure (RHF) may occur.
- In newborns with critical PS, right-to-left shunting through the foramen ovale may occur, causing cyanosis.
- Classified based on the peak systolic transvalvular gradient:
	- **Mild**: <50 mm Hg
	- **Moderate**: 50-80 mm Hg
	- **Severe**: >80 mm Hg
### Diagnosis
- **Symptoms**: Dyspnoea on exertion, cyanosis if severe (due to reduced cardiac output and right-to-left shunt). RHF signs, such as elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), hepatomegaly with pulsation, ascites, and peripheral oedema, are rare but possible. Sudden death may occur in severe cases.
#### Clinical Features
- **Murmur**: Loud, late-peaking, crescendo-decrescendo systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper left sternal border (pulmonary area). The intensity of the murmur is more indicative of severity compared to AS.
- Reduced pulse volume, prominent "a" waves in the JVP (with an enlarged "cv" wave in cases of tricuspid regurgitation secondary to a dilated valve ring), a palpable sternal heave indicating RVH, and a thrill over the pulmonary area.
#### Investigations
- **CXR**: May show an enlarged right atrium and RV, with post-stenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery (PA). RV enlargement can be identified by a "boot-shaped" heart, with the apex lifted off the diaphragm on the PA view. On the lateral view, RV contact with more than 1/3 of the sternum is suggestive of RV enlargement.
- **ECG**: Shows RVH and right axis deviation (RAD).
![[Pasted image 20230904171808.png]]

## Coarctation of the Aorta

- Defined as a discrete narrowing of the aorta, typically around the ductus arteriosus.
- Classified into:
	1. **Preductal (2%)**: Results from reduced blood flow through the left side of the heart during fetal life, leading to hypoplastic development of the aorta.
	2. **Ductal**
	3. **Postductal (98%)**: Likely caused by muscular ductal tissue extending into the aorta during fetal life, which constricts after birth, leading to obstruction.
- Frequently associated with Turner’s syndrome (45, XO) and other cardiac anomalies, such as bicuspid aortic valve, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and single ventricle defects (referred to as complex coarctation).
- It is the seventh most common congenital heart defect (CHD).
### Pathophysiology
- Increased left ventricular (LV) pressure load leads to LV hypertrophy (LVH), and, in advanced cases, left heart failure (LHF).
- Blood flow to the head and upper extremities is preserved, while flow to the descending aorta and lower extremities is diminished.
- Collateral vessels (e.g., intercostals) develop to bypass the coarctation, which may erode the ribs.
#### Complications
- Heart failure, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured aneurysms, aortic dissection, infective endarteritis, and mycotic aneurysms.
### Diagnosis
- **Neonates**: Present with heart failure shortly after birth as the ductus arteriosus closes, especially in preductal or severe postductal coarctation.
- **Preductal coarctation**: Differential cyanosis may be present, with the upper body receiving oxygenated blood from the LV and the lower body receiving poorly oxygenated blood from the right-to-left shunt via the ductus arteriosus.
- **Postductal coarctation**: Diagnosed based on upper body hypertension with weak femoral pulses. If coarctation occurs proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, systolic pressure in the right arm may exceed that in the left arm.
	- Normally, systolic pressure in the leg is higher than in the arm, so if the arm pressure is 20-25 mm Hg higher than the leg pressure, coarctation is suspected.
	- Symptoms include headaches, nosebleeds, and claudication (exercise-induced pain) in the legs.
#### Clinical Features
- **Murmur**: Midsystolic ejection murmur heard over the chest and/or back (below the left scapula). In adults, prominent collateral arteries may produce continuous murmurs over the chest.
#### Investigations
- **CXR**: Shows notching of the inferior surface of posterior ribs due to enlarged intercostal collaterals, and an indented aorta at the coarctation site.
- **ECG**: Demonstrates LVH.
### Treatment
- **Neonates with severe obstruction**:
	- Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) infusion to keep the ductus arteriosus open.
	- Inotropic support, diuretics, and ventilation are often required as these infants are critically ill.
	- Urgent surgical correction is necessary.
![[Pasted image 20230904172246.png]]

## Tetralogy of Fallot

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314172411.png)

- **Most common cyanotic congenital heart defect (CHD)**.
- Involves right-to-left shunt with decreased pulmonary flow, especially during **Tet spells**.
### Characteristics
1. **Right ventricular (RV) outflow obstruction**:
	- Often subvalvular (infundibular spasm causing Tet spells), valvular (40% bicuspid), or supravalvular. Can include pulmonary artery atresia.
2. **Ventricular septal defect (VSD)**:
	- Large defect causing RV pressure to approximate left ventricular (LV) pressure.
3. **Overriding aorta**:
	- The aorta is positioned over the VSD, receiving blood from both ventricles. If it overrides more than 50%, it is classified as double outlet right ventricle (DORV).
4. **Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)**:
	- Due to the combination of pulmonary stenosis and LV pressures.
- Commonly associated with other defects (right-sided aortic arch, atrial septal defect (ASD)—termed **Pentalogy of Fallot** when present, anomalous coronary origins, atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)).
- Associated with genetic syndromes, including **Goldenhar syndrome** and **velo-cardio-facial syndrome (DiGeorge)**, characterized by the mnemonic **CATCH-22**.
### Pathophysiology
- **Shunt flow across the VSD (R→L) depends on:**
	
	1. Severity of RV outflow obstruction (primary determinant of disease severity).
	2. The ratio of **systemic vascular resistance (SVR)** to **pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)**, with SVR playing a larger role as the RV outflow obstruction is relatively fixed.
- At birth, there is usually a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) that helps maintain oxygenation. Cyanosis typically develops as the PDA closes in the first few days.
- **Hypoxaemia and cyanosis** lead to:
	- Clubbing
	- Polycythaemia and hyperviscosity
	- Coagulopathy (decreased platelet function, low fibrinogen)
	- Increased thrombotic risk (CVA, renal thrombosis)
	- Paradoxical embolism
	- Cerebral abscess
	- Respiratory acidosis (increased dead space ventilation)
	- Rare development of congestive heart failure (CHF) due to equalized ventricular workloads from the VSD
### Diagnosis
#### Symptoms
- **Cyanosis**: Begins in early life (not typically immediate as the PDA remains open for a few days). Cyanosis from the first day suggests transposition of the great arteries (TGA).
- **Dyspnoea on exertion**: Hypoxaemia leads to exertional dyspnoea. Squatting may relieve symptoms by increasing SVR.
- **Tet spells**: Hypercyanotic episodes, often triggered by exercise or crying, resulting in severe cyanosis, dyspnoea, loss of consciousness, and possibly seizures.

#### Signs

- **Cyanosis**: Central cyanosis without pulmonary hypertension (PHT) as the shunt occurs within the heart.
- **Clubbing**: Develops by 6 months of age, along with polycythaemia and risk of thrombotic/embolic phenomena (e.g., CVA, renal failure).
- **RVH**: Evident as a sternal heave, with no overall cardiomegaly. Systolic thrill over the pulmonary stenosis area may be palpable.
- **Murmur**: Ejection systolic murmur heard at the left upper sternal border, indicating RV outflow obstruction. There is no murmur from the VSD. Single S2 due to an inaudible pulmonary component.
#### Special Investigations
- **CXR**:
	- Shows RVH, normal heart size with some elevation of the apex, concavity at the main pulmonary artery, right-sided aortic arch, and reduced pulmonary vascular markings.
- **ECG**: Demonstrates RVH and right axis deviation (RAD).
- **Echocardiography**: Confirms TOF anatomy.
- **Cardiac catheterization**: Used to assess pulmonary artery size and coronary anomalies, with pressure and oxygen saturation measurements.

![[Pasted image 20230813152518.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230813152720.png]]

### Complications
1. **Hypercyanotic (Tet) spells**:
	- Occur between 2-4 months of age, precipitated by infundibular spasm or decreased SVR (e.g., crying, exercise). They result in severe hypoxaemia, acidosis, and potentially death.
2. **Polycythaemia**:
	- Leads to hyperviscosity, increased thromboembolic risk, and renal failure. Antiplatelet therapy is generally avoided due to low platelet counts and dysfunctional platelet activity.
3. **Coagulopathy**:
	- Includes thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, decreased fibrinogen, and increased fibrinolysis.
4. **Hypoxaemia**:
	- Contributes to cerebral abscess and increased infective endocarditis (IE) risk.
### Treatment
#### Management of Hypercyanotic Spells
1. **Increase SVR**:
	- Knee-chest position, phenylephrine administration, and volume expansion with fluids (5-10 mL/kg).
2. **Reduce PVR/Infundibular Spasm**:
	- 100% oxygen, morphine (to reduce pulmonary resistance), beta-blockers (e.g., esmolol, propranolol), and deepening anaesthesia (volatile agents).
	- Avoid beta-1 agonists, treat acidosis with sodium bicarbonate, maintain normothermia, and correct anaemia.
	- In severe cyanosis in neonates, PGE1 infusion to keep the ductus arteriosus open is used.
#### Palliative Surgery
- Considered when patients are not candidates for corrective surgery (e.g., due to other health issues, very young age, or complex coronary anatomy). A modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt may be performed.
#### Surgical Correction
- Performed between 6-18 months of age, involving VSD closure with a patch and relief of RV outflow obstruction via muscle resection and possible RVOT patch. A conduit may be used if coronary anatomy complicates RVOT repair.
![[Pasted image 20230813152932.png]]
### Anaesthesia Principles

![[Pasted image 20230813153236.png]]

- **Shunt management**:
	- Right-to-left shunt with reduced pulmonary flow means slower inhalational induction but rapid intravenous effects.
- **Avoid exacerbating R→L shunt**:
	1. **Maintain SVR**: Use phenylephrine and ketamine. Avoid over-heating and histamine-releasing agents.
	2. **Reduce PVR**: Prevent hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis, hypothermia, excessive PEEP, and atelectasis.
	3. **Prevent infundibular obstruction**: Avoid excessive inotropy by maintaining adequate preload and minimizing agitation.
#### Preoperative Considerations
- Maintain hydration and RV volume to prevent infundibular obstruction. Avoid prolonged fasting and agitation.
- Provide gentle premedication, avoid respiratory suppression, and ensure adequate analgesia.
#### Intraoperative Management

- **Induction**: Ketamine is preferred for rapid onset and preservation of SVR. Sevoflurane or halothane can also be used for inhalational induction.
- **Muscle Relaxants**: Pancuronium or other non-histamine releasing agents.
- **Ventilation**: Gentle positive pressure ventilation (PPV) to avoid increased PVR.
- **Phenylephrine**: Administer as needed to maintain SVR.
### Postoperative Considerations
- Increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), arrhythmias (right bundle branch block (RBBB), AV block), pulmonary regurgitation, and residual RV outflow or pulmonary artery stenosis later in life.
## Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA)

- A broad term encompassing various anomalies in the spatial arrangement of large vessels, such as the superior vena cava (SVC), inferior vena cava (IVC), pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins, and aorta. These vessels may not be strictly transposed (swapped) but can be abnormally positioned. When the arteries are exclusively involved, it is referred to as **TGA**.
- It is the **second most common cyanotic congenital heart defect (CHD)**, particularly in neonates. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is more common in older infants and children.
- TGA results from abnormal growth and absorption of the sub-pulmonary and sub-aortic infundibuli during the division of the truncus arteriosus.
![[Pasted image 20230904173400.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230904173800.png]]
### Classification
#### 1. **Dextro-Transposition Of the Great Arteries (D-TGA):**
- This is the classic defect in which the great arteries are switched, leading to cyanotic CHD.
#### 2. **Levo-Transposition Of the Great Arteries (L-TGA or CC-TGA):**
- Also called **congenitally corrected TGA** (CC-TGA). It is an **acyanotic CHD** in which the aorta and pulmonary artery are transposed (the aorta is anterior and to the left of the pulmonary artery). However, the ventricles are also switched, so the right ventricle (RV) pumps to the aorta and the left ventricle (LV) pumps to the pulmonary artery.
- In **simple L-TGA**, no symptoms may appear initially, but over time, the RV becomes hypertrophied from pumping at systemic pressures. This condition is more difficult to correct, often requiring a **double switch operation**.
- The term “**simple**” is used if no other cardiac defects are present and “**complex**” if associated with other defects like atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).
![[Pasted image 20230904173847.png]]
### Dextro-Transposition of the Great Arteries (D-TGA)
- In D-TGA, the great arteries are switched: the aorta arises from the RV and the pulmonary artery from the LV. However, venous drainage remains normal (i.e., vena cavae to right atrium (RA), pulmonary veins to left atrium (LA)).
#### Pathophysiology
- The systemic and pulmonary circulations run in parallel, rather than in series:
  - **Systemic circulation**: Desaturated blood flows from the systemic veins (via vena cavae) into the RA → RV → aorta → systemic circulation (without oxygenation).
  - **Pulmonary circulation**: Oxygenated blood flows from the pulmonary veins into the LA → LV → pulmonary artery → lungs (without reaching the systemic circulation).
- This setup results in extreme **hypoxaemia and cyanosis** in the neonate. Without any natural or medically created mixing between the two circulations (e.g., through a patent foramen ovale (PFO), PDA, or VSD), the condition is fatal.
#### Diagnosis
- **Symptoms/Signs**:
  - General cyanosis, often present within the first day of life, worsens as the PDA closes.
  - **RV heave**: The RV hypertrophies as it functions against systemic pressures.
- **Murmur**: Accentuated **S2** due to the closure of the anteriorly placed aortic valve.
- **CXR**: Typically shows a normal heart size, but the base of the heart appears narrow due to the altered orientation of the aorta and pulmonary artery, leading to the classic "egg on side" appearance.
- **ECG**: Shows RV hypertrophy (RVH) since the RV is the systemic pump.
- **Echocardiography**: Confirms the anatomical defect.
#### Treatment
- **Medical Emergency**: Immediate intervention is required to sustain life.
1. **Maintain PDA**: Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) infusion is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open, allowing for some oxygenated blood to mix with the systemic circulation.
2. **Increase systemic-pulmonary mixing**:
   - Enlarging the interatrial communication via balloon atrial septostomy (Rashkind procedure) can improve mixing between the systemic and pulmonary circulations.
3. **Corrective surgery**:
   - The definitive treatment is the **arterial switch operation (Jatene procedure)**, ideally performed within the first 2-3 weeks of life.
   - If surgery is delayed beyond the neonatal period, **LV “training”** may be necessary. This involves placing a pulmonary artery band to gradually increase LV pressure so that it can eventually handle systemic pressures during the arterial switch.
   - Alternative procedures include **atrial redirection procedures** (e.g., Senning or Mustard procedure), where blood flow within the atria is redirected to create functional correction. These are typically performed later in life.
## Tricuspid Atresia

### Characteristics
- **Tricuspid atresia (TA)** is the **third most common cyanotic congenital heart defect (CHD)** after tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA).
- It is characterized by the **complete absence of the tricuspid valve**, resulting in no direct connection between the right atrium (RA) and the right ventricle (RV).
- An obligatory **right-to-left (R→L) shunt** at the atrial level (through an atrial septal defect (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (PFO)) is necessary for survival, as it allows blood to pass from the RA to the left atrium (LA), but this results in lower systemic oxygen saturation (SaO₂).
### Types of Tricuspid Atresia
- The clinical presentation depends on the morphology of the great vessels and associated defects. The blood flow pattern is influenced by the size of the **ventricular septal defect (VSD)** and the presence or absence of a **patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)**.
![[Pasted image 20230904174415.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230904174444.png]]
#### **Type I TA**
- **Normally positioned great vessels** (aorta and pulmonary artery).
- The RV is usually **hypoplastic** or nearly absent, functioning as a **single ventricle**.
- Blood from the left ventricle (LV) reaches the pulmonary artery (PA) through a VSD.
- A **PDA** is often present to increase pulmonary flow.
- **Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)** is common as the LV pumps both systemic and pulmonary blood.
- If the **pulmonary valve and artery are normal** and the VSD is large and unrestrictive, pulmonary blood flow can be high, leading to **congestive heart failure (CHF)**. However, if the pulmonary valve or artery is stenotic, the patient becomes **dependent on the PDA** for pulmonary blood flow, resulting in **cyanosis**.
#### **Type II TA**
- Associated with **dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA)** in 30% of cases.
- The pulmonary artery is connected to the LV, and systemic circulation relies on flow through the PDA or a VSD.
- In this case, **pulmonary blood flow** is high, resulting in **CHF** and less severe cyanosis.
#### **Type III TA**
- Associated with **levo-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA)**, a condition where the great vessels are reversed, but the pulmonary artery is connected to the RV and the aorta to the LV.
### Pathophysiology
- In tricuspid atresia, blood flow to the pulmonary circulation depends on the presence of a **VSD**, **PDA**, or both.
- The **R→L shunt** at the atrial level allows desaturated blood to enter the left heart, where it mixes with oxygenated pulmonary venous return, resulting in **systemic hypoxaemia**.
- Blood is ejected from the LV to both the aorta and the PA (via the VSD, if present).
- If the PDA closes or the VSD becomes restrictive, **systemic oxygen saturation** decreases significantly.
### Diagnosis
- **Cyanosis** is usually present from birth, but the degree of cyanosis depends on the pulmonary blood flow and the size of the VSD and PDA.
- **CHF** can develop if pulmonary blood flow is high, leading to symptoms like **dyspnoea**, **tachypnoea**, **poor feeding**, and **failure to thrive**.
- A **heart murmur** is often present, typically due to the VSD or increased pulmonary blood flow.
- **CXR** may show cardiomegaly if the LV is hypertrophied, and pulmonary vascular markings depend on the amount of pulmonary blood flow.
- **Echocardiography** is essential to diagnose the condition and assess the size of the VSD, the presence of a PDA, and the overall morphology of the great vessels.
### Treatment
- **Initial stabilization** often requires maintaining the PDA open using **prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)**.
- **Surgical treatment** is usually staged, depending on the type of tricuspid atresia and the associated defects:
	1. **Modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt**: In cases with low pulmonary blood flow, a shunt is created between the subclavian artery and the PA to increase pulmonary blood flow.
	2. **Pulmonary artery banding**: In cases with high pulmonary blood flow, a PA band may be used to reduce excessive pulmonary blood flow and prevent pulmonary vascular disease.
	3. **Fontan procedure**: The ultimate goal of surgical treatment is to establish a **Fontan circulation**, where systemic venous blood is directed to the pulmonary arteries without passing through the RV. This is typically done in stages:
		- **Stage 1**: The BT shunt is placed or pulmonary artery banding is performed.
		- **Stage 2**: **Bidirectional Glenn shunt** (hemi-Fontan) is performed around 6 months of age.
		- **Stage 3**: The complete **Fontan procedure** is done around 2-3 years of age, routing venous blood to the pulmonary circulation directly.
- **Heart transplantation** may be an option if the LV function deteriorates or if surgical repair is not feasible.

## Hypoplastic Left Heart

- 4th most common cyanotic CHD presenting in infancy, most common cardiac cause of death in the first month of life.
- One of a group of cardiac anomalies that can be grouped together under the description “single ventricle” defects.
### Characteristics
- Hypoplastic ascending aorta and aortic arch.
- Hypoplastic left ventricle. Mitral and aortic valves either completely atretic (not developed) or are very small.
- Large patent ductus arteriosus essential for survival (supplies only source of blood flow to the body). RV pumps blood to lungs (via PA) and body (via PDA). When DA starts closing in first day of life, blood flow to body severely diminished and baby dies within hours to days from shock.
- ASD allowing pulmonary venous blood from lungs to reach the single (right) ventricle.
![[Pasted image 20230904175158.png]]
### Diagnosis
- Shock (critical hypoperfusion) within hours of birth as DA starts closing. Weak pulses in all extremities. Lethargy, poor feeding and worsening respiratory distress. Seizures, renal failure, liver failure.
- A mixing lesion (all blood mixes in RA), hence cyanosis.
- Respiratory distress since lungs receive excessive blood flow.
- Often no murmur or just faint murmur.
- Echocardiogram: Easy to diagnose, even before birth so that treatment at delivery can be promptly started. Need to know size of ASD (important for mixing) and DA.
- Cardiac catheterization only important in evaluation of cardiopulmonary function in older child while planning for later stages of treatment.
### Treatment
1. Initial stabilization: Vascular access. Often umbilical vein catheter for medication / sampling. PGE1 infusion to keep the DA open. Ventilate on air to keep sats at 70-80% (higher values increase pulmonary flow and steal blood from body as well as increasing demands on stressed RV). Be prepared for rapid deterioration.
2. Surgical intervention options:
I. Decide not to treat
II. Cardiac transplantation in newborn. Limited by scarcity of newborn organs and need for lifelong anti-rejection therapy.
III. Staged reconstruction
## Persistent Truncus Arteriosus

### Characteristics
- **Persistent truncus arteriosus** results from the defective division of the embryological **truncus arteriosus** into the pulmonary artery and aorta.
- A single large arterial trunk arises from the two ventricles, with a common **truncal valve** (often with 4 leaflets, but can have 2-5) that controls blood flow.
- This arterial trunk sits over a **ventricular septal defect (VSD)** and supplies both systemic and pulmonary circulations. The **pulmonary arteries** branch directly from the truncal vessel.
- **Associated conditions** include:
  - **DiGeorge syndrome** in 1/3 of cases.
  - **Right-sided aortic arch** in 1/3 of cases.
  - **Truncal valve regurgitation**, abnormal coronary arteries, and **coarctation of the aorta**.
- **Classification**: Based on the branching pattern of the pulmonary arteries.

![[Pasted image 20230904175458.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230904175531.png]]

### Pathophysiology
- Complete **mixing of systemic and pulmonary blood** occurs at the level of the truncus and ventricles (if the VSD is large), leading to **cyanosis** at birth.
- Cyanosis is often mild, especially if **pulmonary blood flow** is high.
- **High pulmonary blood flow** occurs in both systole and diastole due to the direct connection of the pulmonary arteries to the common trunk.
- **Congestive heart failure (CHF)** develops within the first week or two of life.
- Early onset of **pulmonary vascular disease** and **pulmonary hypertension (PHT)** is common due to high pulmonary flow.
### Diagnosis
- **Cyanosis** of the lips and nail beds may be present in the first week of life but can be mild and easily missed.
- Signs of **CHF** such as **dyspnoea**, **tachypnoea**, **sweating**, poor feeding, poor growth, and **hepatomegaly** typically develop days to weeks after birth.
- **Systolic ejection murmur** is heard at the left sternal border.
- **Bounding pulses** and widened pulse pressure, especially if there is truncal valve incompetence.
- If **DiGeorge syndrome** is present, **hypocalcaemia** may be detected.
- **CXR**: Cardiomegaly and plethoric lung fields due to increased pulmonary blood flow.
- **Echocardiogram**: Confirms the diagnosis by defining the truncal morphology and associated defects.
### Treatment
- **Initial stabilization** includes treatment of heart failure with medications such as **digoxin** and **diuretics**.
- **Nutritional support** via feeding tube or **IV hyperalimentation** to maintain adequate growth.
- **Surgical repair** is necessary as soon as possible after diagnosis and involves:
  1. **Separation of the pulmonary arteries** from the truncus arteriosus.
  2. **VSD closure** with a patch.
  3. Creation of a **valved conduit** between the RV and the pulmonary arteries, typically using a donor pulmonary artery **homograft** (allograft) or a pig valve within a **Dacron conduit**.
- **Postoperative care**:
  - Intensive ICU management with inotropes, ventilation, and sometimes delayed sternal closure to allow the heart to recover from swelling.
  - The conduit/homograft usually needs to be replaced one or two times before adulthood as the child grows.
  - Good long-term prognosis with **83% survival** at 15 years.
- **Infective endocarditis prophylaxis** is required before any invasive procedures.
## Ebstein’s Anomaly

### Characteristics
- **Ebstein’s anomaly** is a congenital malformation of the **tricuspid valve**.
- The **tricuspid valve** is abnormally positioned, with two leaflets displaced downward into the right ventricle (RV), while the third leaflet is elongated and often tethered to the RV wall, leading to **tricuspid incompetence**.
- This abnormal positioning causes the **right atrium (RA)** to become enlarged due to high pressure, which may keep the **foramen ovale** open, leading to a **right-to-left (R→L) shunt** and resulting in **hypoxaemia** and possible **cyanosis**.
- The combination of **RA pressure overload** and **left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) volume overload** can lead to **congestive heart failure (CHF)** if the condition is severe.
- Ebstein’s anomaly is often associated with:
  - Pulmonary stenosis or atresia
  - Atrial septal defect (ASD)
  - Ventricular septal defect (VSD)
  - Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome
![[Pasted image 20230904180017.png]]
### Diagnosis
- **Asymptomatic** cases may be diagnosed through detection of a **heart murmur** caused by **tricuspid incompetence** or extra heart sounds.
- **Cyanosis** can be present in infants if the R→L shunt is significant.
- Symptoms include **palpitations** (often due to **supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)**), **shortness of breath (SOB)** with exertion, and sometimes **chest pain**.
- Severe cases can lead to **congestive heart failure**.
#### Investigations
- **CXR**: Shows an **enlarged heart** (cardiomegaly).
- **Echocardiogram**: Identifies the abnormal tricuspid valve morphology, assesses the severity of valve incompetence or stenosis, and confirms the presence of a **patent foramen ovale (PFO)** or ASD.
- **ECG**: May show arrhythmias, and a **Holter monitor** might be required to detect **SVT**.
- **Cardiac catheterization**: Rarely necessary but may be used to fully define the anatomy and function of the heart.
- **Electrophysiology studies**: To evaluate and treat abnormal heart rhythms, particularly if associated with WPW syndrome.
### Treatment
- **Mild defect**: No treatment is required except for **infective endocarditis prophylaxis**.
- **Medical management**:
  - Treat **heart failure** and **dysrhythmias**.
- **Surgical intervention**: Indicated if the patient develops **heart failure**, significant **heart enlargement**, **cyanosis**, or **thrombus formation**. Surgery may involve:
  - **Repair or replacement of the tricuspid valve**.
  - Closure of the **foramen ovale** or **ASD**.
  - In severe cases, surgical management may follow the pathway for **single ventricle repair**.
- **Catheter ablation**: Used to eliminate **accessory conduction pathways**, especially in patients with WPW syndrome.
## Single Ventricle
	

The term "complex single ventricle" or "uni-ventricular heart" refers to a group of rare congenital heart defects in which **only one functional ventricle** is of adequate size to support circulation. This category includes several distinct heart defects.

### Types of Single Ventricle Defects
- **Tricuspid atresia**
- **Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)**
- **Double inlet left ventricle**
- Certain forms of **double outlet right ventricle (DORV)**
- **Heterotaxy syndromes** associated with various single-ventricle defects
These defects share common health effects and surgical treatment pathways, similar to hypoplastic left heart syndrome and tricuspid atresia. They are characterized by a single ventricle supporting both systemic and pulmonary circulation.
![[Pasted image 20230905120050.png]]
### Diagnosis
- **Mixing of systemic and pulmonary blood** occurs in the single functioning ventricle, leading to different clinical presentations based on pulmonary blood flow:
  - **High pulmonary flow** (no obstruction to the pulmonary valve): Results in **congestive heart failure** with symptoms such as poor feeding, sweating, tachypnoea, and poor growth.
  - **Low pulmonary flow**: Causes **cyanosis** in the first week of life. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) may be crucial to maintain pulmonary blood flow, and its closure can result in severe hypoxaemia and cyanosis.
- **Echocardiography**: Can diagnose single ventricle defects, often even before birth.
- **Cardiac catheterization**: Rarely needed, but may be used to plan surgery and assess cardiac and pulmonary artery pressures.
### Treatment
- The primary surgical approach involves **staged reconstructive surgeries** leading to a **Fontan circulation**, where systemic venous blood bypasses the heart and is directed to the lungs without passing through a pumping chamber. The single ventricle supports systemic circulation.
#### **Newborn Period**
- **Low pulmonary flow**: A **Modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt** may be performed to increase pulmonary blood flow.
- **High pulmonary flow**: A **pulmonary artery band** is placed to reduce the burden on the ventricle and prevent pulmonary vascular disease caused by high pressure.
- If pulmonary and systemic blood flows are balanced, **no surgery** is required during the neonatal period.
- For **hypoplastic left heart syndrome**, the **Norwood procedure** is typically performed.
#### **Around 6 Months**
- The second stage of surgery is the **bidirectional Glenn shunt** (also known as the hemi-Fontan procedure), where the superior vena cava (SVC) is connected directly to the pulmonary arteries. If a prior BT shunt is present, it is removed, and a pulmonary artery band may be removed depending on the situation.
  - Post-Glenn surgery, oxygen saturations are typically **75-85%**.
#### **2-3 Years of Age**
- The third and final stage is the **complete Fontan procedure**, which routes systemic venous return to the pulmonary arteries, bypassing the heart. After this stage, oxygen saturations are typically in the **90s**.
  - Patients usually require **warfarin** to prevent clots in the Fontan circuit.
- **Heart transplantation** is a potential option if ventricular function deteriorates over time.
## Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Drainage/Return (TAPVR)

### Characteristics
- In **TAPVR**, all four pulmonary veins drain abnormally into the **right atrium (RA)** through abnormal connections, rather than the left atrium (LA).
- **Atrial septal defect (ASD)** is essential for survival, allowing oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins to reach the left side of the heart and systemic circulation. Absence of an ASD is incompatible with life.
- TAPVR can occur with other complex heart defects.
- If only some pulmonary veins are abnormally connected, it is termed **partial anomalous venous return** (e.g., **Scimitar syndrome**, associated with right lung hypoplasia, dextroposition of the heart, pulmonary artery hypoplasia, and pulmonary sequestration).
### Types of TAPVR
- **Supracardiac TAPVR**:  
  Pulmonary veins drain into the RA via the **superior vena cava (SVC)**. The veins join behind the heart and drain upwards through a vertical vein, which connects to the brachiocephalic (innominate) vein, entering the SVC.
  ![[Pasted image 20230905120547.png]]
  
- **Cardiac TAPVR** (intra-cardiac):  
  Pulmonary veins join behind the heart and drain into the RA via the **coronary sinus** or directly into the RA.
  ![[Pasted image 20230905120619.png]]

- **Infracardiac TAPVR** (infradiaphragmatic):  
  Pulmonary veins join behind the heart and drain downwards through the **portal or hepatic veins** to the RA via the **inferior vena cava (IVC)**. This type has the highest incidence of **obstruction** to pulmonary venous return.

![[Pasted image 20230905120715.png]]

### Pathophysiology
- There is **total mixing** of systemic venous and pulmonary venous blood in the RA, resulting in **hypoxaemia** and **cyanosis**.
- The LA and LV are filled by mixed blood that shunts right-to-left across the ASD.
- **Increased volume load** on the RV leads to excessive pulmonary flow.
- If the abnormal pulmonary venous pathway is **obstructed**, it can cause **pulmonary congestion, oedema, pulmonary hypertension (PHT)**, and critical illness in neonates with severe cyanosis and haemodynamic instability.
### Diagnosis
- **Obstructed pulmonary venous return**:  
  Critically ill neonates present with **severe cyanosis**, **respiratory distress**, **tachypnoea**, grunting, and retractions
- **Unobstructed pulmonary venous return**:  
  Asymptomatic or with mild tachypnoea, subtle cyanosis, and possibly a heart murmur due to RV overload.
- **Oximetry**: Saturations are typically in the mid-to-high 80s
- **ECG**: Shows RA and RV enlargement.
- **CXR**:
  - Enlarged RA and RV with **pulmonary plethora** due to increased pulmonary blood flow.
  - **Pulmonary oedema** if there is obstructed venous return
- **Echocardiography**:  
  Provides a definitive diagnosis by showing the abnormal pulmonary venous connections, RA and RV enlargement, and the size of the ASD and its flow.
- **Cardiac catheterization**:  
  Occasionally needed to define the abnormal pulmonary venous drainage, especially in **mixed types** (e.g., some veins drain supracardiac and others infracardiac). It can also identify obstructed pulmonary veins and assess the restrictiveness of the ASD, which can be treated with balloon dilation.
### Treatment
- **Emergency surgery** is required in neonates with **obstructed pulmonary venous drainage**. **ECMO** (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) may be necessary before surgery.
- For patients without obstruction, **elective surgery** is typically performed within days to weeks of diagnosis.
- **Balloon dilatation of the ASD** may be performed if it is restrictive.
- **Surgical repair** involves connecting the **common pulmonary venous confluence** to the LA, tying off abnormal venous connections, and closing the ASD. Surgical outcomes are generally excellent as normal circulation is restored.
## Pulmonary Atresia
	

Pulmonary atresia is a congenital heart defect characterized by the **absence of a normal pulmonary valve**, which obstructs blood flow from the right ventricle (RV) to the lungs. It is classified into two types:  

1. **Pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS)**  
2. **Pulmonary atresia with a ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD)**
### Characteristics
- **Pulmonary valve fails to develop properly** in utero, resulting in a complete blockage of blood flow from the RV to the pulmonary artery.
- An **atrial septal defect (ASD)** is almost always present and essential for survival, allowing oxygenated blood from the lungs to reach the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV).
- Blood flow to the lungs is dependent on a **patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)**, which must remain open after birth to sustain life.
- In some cases, a **ventricular septal defect (VSD)** is present (this form resembles a type of tetralogy of Fallot). In the absence of a VSD, the RV receives little to no blood before birth, leading to underdevelopment of the **RV**, **tricuspid valve**, and **pulmonary artery**.
- Around **50%** of patients have abnormal connections (fistulas) between the RV and the coronary arteries, complicating surgical repair.
### Pathophysiology
- **Low pulmonary blood flow** occurs due to the dependency on the PDA, with mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood occurring through the ASD and possibly the VSD.
- This leads to **hypoxaemia** and **cyanosis**, as oxygenated blood is insufficiently circulated.
### Diagnosis
- Often diagnosed **prenatally** via echocardiogram.
- **Cyanosis** and **hypoxaemia** can present immediately after birth, depending on the degree of pulmonary blood flow and mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Collateral vessels to the lungs may develop in some cases.
- A **heart murmur** may be heard, related to the VSD, PDA, or high LV output.
- **Echocardiogram** confirms the diagnosis.
- **Cardiac catheterization** can assist in surgical planning by measuring pressures and saturations in the heart chambers and visualizing heart structures using contrast.
### Treatment
- **Medical stabilization** involves:
  - **Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)** to keep the ductus arteriosus open.
  - **Septostomy** may be performed to enlarge a restrictive ASD, improving blood mixing.
- **Surgical treatment** depends on the size and development of the RV and tricuspid valve:
  1. **If the RV and tricuspid valve are large enough**:
	 - A patch may be used to **widen the pulmonary valve**. Later in life, pulmonary valve replacement may be necessary.
	 - Complete repair is possible by inserting a **graft valve (conduit)** to replace the pulmonary valve.
  2. **If the RV and tricuspid valve are underdeveloped**:
	 - A **staged palliative surgical approach** is used to bypass the poorly developed right heart structures:
	   - **Stage 1**: **Modified Blalock-Taussig shunt** to redirect blood from the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery.
	   - **Stage 2**: **Glenn shunt**, connecting the superior vena cava directly to the pulmonary arteries.
	   - **Stage 3**: **Fontan procedure**, where venous blood is directed straight to the lungs, bypassing the underdeveloped right heart.
- **Note**: **Hypoplastic right heart syndrome** refers to severe underdevelopment of the right-sided heart structures, particularly in cases of **pulmonary atresia without VSD**, where the RV, tricuspid valve, and pulmonary artery are significantly underdeveloped. The treatment considerations are the same as those described above.

![[Pasted image 20230905121202.png]]

## Interrupted Aortic Arch

### Characteristics
- Absence or discontinuation of a portion of the aortic arch.
- Classified according to site of interruption:
a) Type A: Interruption just distal to left subclavian artery (30-40%)
b) Type B (shown below): Interruption between left carotid and left subclavian artery (>50%). Often associated with DiGeorge syndrome = birth defects (CHD, defects in palate, facial dysmorphism, kidney defects etc.), learning disabilities, recurrent infections (absent or hypoplastic thymus with defective T-cell immune response) and hypoparathyroidism with hypocalcaemia. It is due to a deletion on chromosome 22 (hence mnemonic = CATCH-22): Cardiac abnormality (especially TOF), Abnormal facies, Thymic aplasia, Cleft palate, Hypocalcaemia
c) Type C: Interruption between brachiocephalic (innominate) artery and left carotid artery (4%).
- Almost always associated with a large VSD.
- Often occurs together with other defects (truncus arteriosus, TGA and aortic stenosis).
![[Pasted image 20230905121601.png]]
### Pathophysiology
- Oxygenated blood from left side of heart cannot get to all parts of systemic circulation (just part proximal to interruption), depends on PDA for blood flow to lower body.
- If DA closes shortly after birth:
- Shock distal to interruption, relative LV overload proximal.
- L to R shunt over VSD with high pulmonary blood flow.
- Above two both contribute to CHF.
### Diagnosis
- As DA closes in first day or two of life, distal hypoperfusion (legs and feet pale, mottled and cool with poor urine output and poor pulses) and CHF.
- Echocardiogram confirms the diagnosis.
### Treatment
- Medical stabilization: PGE1 infusion to keep DA open, Intubate, ventilate. Diuretic for CHF. Inotrope. Correct blood gasses and electrolytes. Nutrition.
- Urgent surgery after stabilization (in first few days of life). Cannot survive without it: Connect separate portions of aorta, Close VSD with a patch, Ligate the PDA. IE prophylaxis during bacteraemic procedures.
## Vascular Rings

- **Vascular rings** refer to abnormally located blood vessels that cause compression and obstruction of the **esophagus** and/or **airway**.
### Classification
- Abnormal development of the **aortic arch** can lead to a formation of a ring by the aortic arch or its associated vessels, encircling the **trachea** and **esophagus**. This compression can cause symptoms of airway or esophageal obstruction.
- The most common vascular ring anomaly is the **double aortic arch**.
#### Types of Vascular Rings

a) **Complete Vascular Ring**:  

   - These anomalies completely encircle and compress both the esophagus and trachea.
   - **>95% of complete vascular rings** are caused by:
	 1. **Double aortic arch**
	 2. **Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery origin**
b) **Incomplete Vascular Ring**:  
   - These anomalies compress but do not fully encircle the esophagus and trachea.
   - Examples include:
	 1. **Aberrant right subclavian artery**
	 2. **Anomalous innominate artery**
	 3. **Aberrant left pulmonary artery (vascular sling)**
	 4. **Right aortic arch with mirror-image branching**
![[Pasted image 20230905122134.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230905122212.png]]

## Anomalous Left Coronary Artery (ALCAPA)

The left coronary artery originates abnormally from the **pulmonary artery** instead of the **aorta**.

### Pathophysiology
- After birth, pulmonary arterial pressure drops significantly. This pressure is insufficient to adequately perfuse the anomalous left coronary artery (LCA).
- The heart develops **collateral circulation** from the right coronary artery, but since the pulmonary artery has a much lower resistance than the aorta, blood flow is **retrograde** from the LCA into the pulmonary artery.
- This retrograde flow results in insufficient oxygen delivery to the **left ventricular (LV) myocardium**, causing **myocardial ischemia** in the anterolateral distribution.
- The ischemia leads to:
	- **Global LV dilatation** and dysfunction.
	- **Mitral valve regurgitation** due to infarction of papillary muscles and/or mitral annular dilatation.
	- **Left atrial (LA) dilatation** due to mitral regurgitation.
	- **Pulmonary venous congestion** and symptoms of **congestive heart failure** combined with **angina pectoris**.
### Treatment
- The primary treatment is **surgical re-implantation** of the anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery to the aorta to restore normal coronary blood flow and prevent further ischemia.

## Summary: Practical Approach to CHD

### Pre-operative: Identify the Problem in a Child with CHD

#### **History**
- Symptoms of **heart failure** (sweating, poor feeding), **cyanotic spells**, squatting?
- **Medical history**, **surgical history** (e.g., previous shunts and their patency).
- **Medications**:
  - Digoxin, diuretics (check electrolytes).
  - Beta-blockers (e.g., for TOF).
  - Anticoagulants, vasoconstrictors, **PGE1** (can cause tachycardia, hypotension, apnoea, seizures, etc.). Do **not flush lines** containing PGE1.
- Pacemaker?
#### **Examination**
- Signs of **cardiac failure** (tachycardia, tachypnoea, hepatomegaly, gallop rhythm).
- **Hypoxaemia**, **cyanosis**, **polycythaemia**, hyperviscosity, pulmonary hypertension (PHT), shock.
- Congenital abnormalities (e.g., **Down syndrome**, **DiGeorge syndrome**).
- Check **blood pressure** in all limbs.

#### **Investigations**
- FBC, U+E, INR, aPTT, platelet function tests.
- Oximetry, blood gases.
- CXR, CT, MRI.
- ECG, Echocardiogram.
- Catheter study.
#### **Key Questions**
1. Which **CHD**? Accurate diagnosis is essential.
2. Understand the **anatomy and pathophysiological consequences**, focusing on:
   - Pulmonary blood flow: source, volume, and reliability.
   - Venous drainage and arterial exit from the heart.
   - Visualize options for oxygenated and deoxygenated blood reaching the aorta.
#### **Patient State**
- Stabilize the patient:
  - Optimize **systemic oxygen delivery (DO2)** = systemic ventricular output x CaO2.
  - Fluids, **PGE1**, inotropes, vasoconstrictors, sedatives, oxygenation, ventilation, ECMO.
  - Balance systemic and pulmonary resistance (aim for systemic flow ≈ pulmonary flow).
  - Haemodilute if **PCV >65%** to improve systemic flow.
#### **Anaesthetic Plan**
- Tailored to specific lesion.
- Pre-op **premeds** may not be necessary under 1 year but consider **midazolam** (0.25-0.5 mg/kg PO) for children between 6 months and 1 year to prevent agitation.
### Intra-operative

#### **Preparation**
- Goals: Optimize **DO2** to vital organs.
- Equipment: Anaesthetic machine, monitors (A-line, central line, temperature, blood gases, electrolytes, Hb, glucose), airway accessories, defibrillator.
- Drugs: Ketamine, opiates, phenylephrine, adrenaline, atropine, etc.
- Baseline observations, IV line setup, monitor attachment.
#### **Induction**
- IV or inhalational induction.  
- Slow administration of agents to assess response.  
- Ketamine, vasoconstrictors, inotropes, and early paralysis to avoid coughing or spasm, which may precipitate cyanotic spells.
#### **Maintenance**
- Tailored to lesion.  
- **Ketamine** for right-to-left lesions or systemic-to-pulmonary shunt surgeries.  
- Judicious use of inhalational agents for left-to-right lesions.  
- Balance anaesthesia to minimize myocardial depression.

### Considerations Before Anesthetizing Adult Patients with Congenital Heart Disease
#### **General Considerations**
- **Understanding of Cardiac Anatomy and Pathophysiology**: Knowledge of the detailed anatomy of the heart, vessels, and the associated pathophysiological changes is crucial.
- **Residual Defects**: Be aware of potential residual defects in patients who have previously undergone cardiac surgeries.
- **Inotropic and Vasodilatory Effects of Anesthesia**: Consider the potential negative inotropic and vasodilatory effects caused by anesthesia which may impact cardiac function.
- **Ventilatory Strategies**: The choice of ventilation strategy can affect the distribution of blood flow and should be selected carefully.
- **Risk of Cardiac Arrhythmias**: Patients may have an increased risk of arrhythmias. Anti-arrhythmics could cause intolerable negative inotropy. If cardioversion is necessary, ensure anticoagulation or rule out thrombus via TOE (Transesophageal Echocardiography).
- **Antibiotic and Thromboprophylaxis**: There's a need for both antibiotic prophylaxis and strategies to prevent thromboembolism.
- **Bleeding Risks**: Consider the high risk of bleeding, especially in patients with preload-dependent lesions who will not tolerate significant blood loss. High hematocrit may be required in patients with chronically low oxygen delivery.
- **Additional Co-morbidities in Older Patients**: For older patients, consider additional comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and renal impairment.
#### **Specific Anesthetic Considerations for Patients with Congenital Heart Disease**
- **Anaesthetic Agents**: The onset of anaesthetic agents may be slowed; dosage and choice of agents may need to be adjusted.
- **Monitoring and Access**: Special considerations should be given to the patient's unique anatomy when placing central venous catheters (CVC) or arterial lines (A-line).
- **Bleeding and Thromboprophylaxis**:
	- Patients with chronic low oxygen delivery may require irradiated blood, especially in conditions like DiGeorge syndrome.
	- High risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) necessitates mechanical prophylaxis (e.g., compressive stockings, pneumatic devices) and/or pharmacological methods.
- **Regional Anesthesia**:
	- The effects of decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) when using neuraxial techniques must be assessed.
	- Consider the anticoagulation status when planning for regional blocks due to potential bleeding risks.
#### **Additional Considerations**
- **Heart Failure Management**: Requires careful fluid balance and may necessitate specialist referral to optimize the patient's condition.
- **Psychological Impact**: The psychological wellbeing of the patient should also be considered as part of the pre-operative evaluation.
- **Pregnancy**: Special anesthetic considerations are required during pregnancy due to physiological changes and the impact on both mother and fetus.
