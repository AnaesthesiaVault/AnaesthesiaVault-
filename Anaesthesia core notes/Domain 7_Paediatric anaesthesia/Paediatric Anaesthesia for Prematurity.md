# Introduction

![](Pasted%20image%2020240314164301.png)

- Premature infants are a high-risk group and should be managed at specialised paediatric centres.
- They present unique anatomical, physiological and pharmacological challenges.
- It is essential that the proposed interventions, goals of therapy and ongoing problems are discussed within the multidisciplinary team
# Definitions

WHO:

- Classified by gestational age (the duration of pregnancy from the first day of the last menstrual period) or weight
- **Preterm:** Live birth before 37 weeks’ gestational age. **Moderate to late preterm:** 3237 weeks. **Very preterm:** 28-32 weeks **Extremely preterm:** <28 weeks
- **Low birth weight**: <2500 g **Very low birth weight (VLBW)**: <1500 g **Extremely low birth weight (ELBW):** <1000 g
- Postmenstrual age (PMA) is the GA + chronological age (time elapsed since birth)
# Epidemiology
- 1/10 babies born premature (15 million annually). Increasing trend
- Leading cause of death in children younger than 5
- 3.1% of all disability adjusted life years
- Mortality mostly in neonatal period and increases with lower gestational age. Approximate 10x higher mortality (MBRRACE (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries)
- Mortality reducing over the past two decades (neonatal resus, specialist neonatal units and use of exogenous surfactant and steroids) (EPIPAGE/EPICURE2)
# Common Procedures
- PDA ligation
- Vitrectomy or laser for retinopathy of prematurity
- Inguinal hernia repair
- Laparotomy for NEC or bowel perforation
- CT/MRI scanning
# Physiological and Anatomical Changes

## Airway and Respiratory
### Normal

Terminal bronchioles develop by week 16 and viable gas exchange surfaces from week 24

- Alveoli start to develop at birth but do not reach mature numbers until adolescence.
- Surfactant is produced from 23 to 24 weeks but often in insufficient quantities until 35 weeks
### Prematurity
- **Increased PVR, stiff non compliant lungs, atelectasis and VQ mismatch:** Vasculogenesis is disruptedabnormal distribution of alveolar capillaries and thickened pulmonary arterioles
- **Upper airway is more prone to obstruction** due to compliant soft tissues, poorly coordinated muscle groups at the pharyngeal level and congenital or acquired pathology such as laryngoand tracheomalacia, tracheal stenosis or subglottic stenosis.
- **Increased WOB:* and early fatigue of respiratory muscles:** Chest wall and lung mechanics are inefficient. The highly compliant, cartilaginous chest wall with horizontally aligned ribs provides minimal excursion with diaphragmatic movement and lacks the elastic recoil of the adult chest wall. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles fatigue easily as they contain minimal type 1 (endurance) fibres
- **Closing Capacity higher than FRC**: Minimal elasticity and smaller airways tend to collapse leading to air trapping and increased residual volume. (Have ability to auto-PEEP, increase RR with short exp time and laryngeal adduction)
- **Immature control of respiration and chemoreceptor response:** Blunted chemoreceptor response to hypercarbia. ‘Biphasic’ response to hypoxia (initial hyperventilation followed by respiratory depression or apnoea), in addition to exaggerated inhibitory responses to laryngeal stimulation or lung inflation  
- **Perfect storm of anaesthesia**: Compensatory mechanisms are lost. higher oxygen demand is unmet owing to the combined effects of an easily obstructed airway, immature lung function and inefficient respiratory mechanics and control
- **High metabolic consumption**
### How Does the Neonatal Heart Differ from an Adult Heart?

- **Parasympathetic Innervation:** The parasympathetic nervous system, which typically slows the heart rate and decreases contractility, is not as functional in neonates. This is contrasted with the sympathetic nervous system, which enhances heart rate and contractility.
	
- **Contractile Elements:** The neonatal heart possesses fewer contractile elements. This limitation affects its ability to increase stroke volume (SV) significantly, which is crucial in maintaining cardiac output (CO), especially during periods of increased physiological demand, such as in afterload situations.
	
- **Compliance:** Neonatal hearts show reduced compliance due to a deficiency of elastic elements within their structure. This factor contributes to the challenges in adjusting stroke volume responsively.
	
- **Heart Mass to Lung Volume Ratio:** There is a notable ratio of right ventricle (RV) mass to left ventricle (LV) mass of 2:1 in neonates. This ratio, significant during fetal circulation, begins to adjust only a few months after birth as the circulatory demands evolve postnatally.
	
- **Mitochondrial and Cytoplasmic Composition:** Neonatal cardiac cells have fewer mitochondria and less cytoplasmic reticula. These cellular components are crucial for energy production and storage, impacting how the heart responds to metabolic demands.
	
- **Calcium Dependence and Ischaemic Tolerance:** Neonatal hearts depend more on extracellular calcium for contraction. Despite this dependence, they exhibit a higher tolerance to ischaemic events and recover more rapidly after such incidents compared to adult hearts.

### Pathologies

#### Apnoea

- Cessation of airflow for 20 s, or <20 s associated with bradycardia, cyanosis or pallor
- 80% ELBW infants, with risk decreasing as GA increases
- Classified as obstructive, central or mixed depending on the cause, which is attributable to immature ventilatory control, failure to maintain airway patency, or both
- Exacerbated by hypoxia, hypoglycaemia, hypo-/hyperthermia, anaemia, sedative drugs, the neurohormonal response to surgery and postoperative pain
- The risk of postoperative apnoea is minimal by 60 weeks’ PMA
- Management: Usually conservative. Nasal CPAP and methylxanthine stimulants such as caffeine or theophylline. Humidified high flow nasal cannulae may also be used they provide more variable levels of CPAP.
#### Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia

- Chronic lung condition of prematurity first caused by interruption to lung development and lung injury
- Definition: oxygen requirement over 36 weeks’ PMA
- Antenatal steroids and the use of surfactant, alongside advances in lung protective ventilation and non-invasive ventilation have completely changed the nature and course of the condition
- Major risk factors include mechanical ventilation and high FIO2
- Vulnerable to cellular damage from cytotoxic reactive oxygen metabolites, which overwhelm their immature antioxidant system, contributing to conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
### Ventilation in NICU
- Volume control ventilation recommended (Cochrane review)
- Avoid: Atelectotrauma with higher PEEP and recruitment manoeuvres, using synchronised modes limiting excessive pressure, permissive hypercapnia.
- High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) provides higher mean airway pressure than conventional ventilation to prevent atelectasis, and small rapid tidal volumes to protect against volutrauma and promote gas exchange (should be first line)
## CVS
- **Stroke volume is fixed and HR depended:** Ventricles are non-compliant because of a higher ratio of fibrous to contractile tissue in neonatal myocytes. NB! Normal HR and rhythm
- **Myocardial ischaemia:** Can result from an overfilled ventricle because of increased wall tension compromising coronary perfusion
- **Less responsive to inotropes and reliant on extracellular calcium:** neonatal myocardium is less sensitive to the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of catecholamines because baseline beta adrenergic stimulation is close to maximal. Myocardium also relies on extracellular Ca2þ, rather than intracellular stores, because of immature t-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum systems. Therefore, maintaining normocalcaemia is critical to preserving inotropy
- **Acceptable BP's is controversial:** Neonate’s age in weeks as the minimum acceptable MAP. Will not guarantee adequate perfusion, particularly in critical areas such as the brain. It is likely that measurements of perfusion are more valuable than blood pressure in this age group. There is evidence to suggest that poor cerebral perfusion may have a negative impact on neurocognitive outcomes. However, there is also research suggesting that overtreatment of hypotension is associated with poorer outcomes (NEC, BPD and intraventricular haemorrhage)
- **Larger blood volume:** 110 ml kg 1 in an extremely preterm infant to 90 ml kg 1 in a term neonate. Absolute blood volume still very low.
### Pathology
#### Congenital Heart Disease More Common

PDA (30%) and ASD/VSD. It is normal physiology in the fetal circulation, allowing blood from the pulmonary artery to bypass the non-functional fetal lungs into the aorta. It closes functionally by day 3 of life and anatomically by 2-3 weeks. The duct often persists in premature babies and can also reopen under conditions commonly associated with anaesthesia (such as hypoxia and acidosis). Haemodynamically significant PDAs result in excessive pulmonary blood flow at the expense of the systemic and coronary circulation (because of lower diastolic pressures) eventually leading to pulmonary hypertension and cardiac failure. Babies with PDAs are also at increased risk of pulmonary haemorrhage, BPD, IVH and NEC. The management of PDAs can be medical or surgical, with the former including fluid restriction, diuretics and non-selective COX inhibitors (e.g. ibuprofen or indomethacin), with potential for hypovolaemia, renal injury and bleeding.

## Neurological System
- **Vulnerable to physiological insult**: Both structural immaturity and inadequate cerebral autoregulation leading to fluctuations in cerebral blood flow.
- **IVH**: first few days of life, the majority being within 24 h. Risk increased by risk hypoxia, hypocarbia and hypercarbia, extremes of blood pressure, rapid fluid shifts and metabolic derangements
- **Pain:** Rudimentary pain pathways are developed by 2325 weeks but discrimination between tactile and nociception may not occur until 3536 weeks. Early exposure to painful procedure result in structural and poorer motor and cognitive outcomes.
- **Neurotoxicity:** Clear preclinical evidence of neurological injury caused by anaesthetic agents over prolonged or repeated exposure. Preterm exposed to GA has decreased relative white matter volumes at term equivalent age and lower cognitive and motor composite scores at 2-year followup. The longer the exposure the worse it gets. [@Walsh.etal_Surgeryrequiring_2021]
## Haematology
- **Anaemia:** Lower HB (13-15 compared with 18-20 in neonates) and are unable to increase erythropoietin production appropriately. The nadir in haemoglobin at 8-12 weeks is also more pronounced. Predisposing factors include blood loss from phlebotomy, reduced red blood cell life span and iron depletion owing to growth and suboptimal nutrition.
- **Left shift of oxygen delivery curve:** Increased fetal haemoglobin (HbF) levels (up to 70-80%) and reduces oxygen delivery at tissue level
- **Coagulopathy**: vitamin Kand non-vitamin K-dependent clotting factors are deficient, and the platelet count is often low
## Skin and Temperature
- **Prone to hypothermia**: The dermis is thin and non-keratinised at 32 weeks and they have a large surface area/volume ratio. Brown fat only differentiates from 26 weeks, and thermoregulatory systems are immature
- **Fragile skin**: little subcutaneous fat, leading to increased risk of thermal, chemical and pressure injuries.
- **Difficult IV access
## GIT
- **Hyperand hypoglycaemia:** Hypoglycaemia results from minimal glycogen reserves (usually accrued during the third trimester) and limited ketogenesis and lipolysis. Hyperglycaemia is caused by incomplete suppression of hepatic glucose production and defective insulin secretion. Sepsis, drugs, high rates of glucose-containing i.v. solutions and counter-regulatory ‘stress’ hormones released in response to pain and mechanical ventilation also contribute. Hyperglycaemia has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity including ROP and IVH. Blood glucose should be monitored and maintained within locally agreed limits (usually around 4-8 mmol/L
- **Aspiration risk**: decreased oesophageal motility, delayed gastric emptying and lower oesophageal sphincter incompetence
- **Jaundice and hypoalbinemia**: (unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia) is invariable in babies born 35 weeks. The pathogenesis is the same as that of term babies, but relative hypoalbuminaemia results in decreased bilirubin binding capacity and a greater unbound bilirubin fraction. Bilirubin encephalopathy may be present, which can manifest subtly as apnoea or desaturations in this age group
### Necrotizing Enterocolitis

- Most common gastrointestinal emergency in the premature infant. Up to 12% of premature infants are affected (mainly those weighing 1500 g) and manifests as ischaemic necrosis of the small bowel
- Pathophysiology: Immaturity of the immune system and bowel structure, combined with triggers such as non-human milk feeds, antibiotics, hypoperfusion, anaemia and hypoxia result in dysbiosis and a hyperinflammatory response.
- Diagnosis: The hallmark feature on abdominal X-ray (AXR) is intramural gas with or without portal venous gas.
- Complications: Bowel perforation, peritonitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and shock with mortality approaching 50% in severe cases.
- Management is largely supportive although surgery is sometimes indicated, either by inserting a peritoneal drain or by performing a laparotomy for bowel resection and proximal enterostomy.
## Renal System
- Kidney size and nephron number increase with GA, with 60% of nephrons formed during the third trimester
- **Abnormal electrolyte handling, acidosis, increased free water and poor clearance of drugs and metabolites**: Immature nephron function
- **High risk for hyponatremia:** Reduced concentrating ability (maximally 400 mOsm), increased sodium excretion and relative insensitivity to aldosterone
## Pharmacology
- **Slower metabolism**: will accumulate with repeat doses or infusions. Most enzyme systems (e.g. cytochrome P450 and phase 2 liver reactions) have reduced activity. In addition, renal elimination is reduced
- **Increased TBW and VD**: offset by increased end-organ sensitivity and reduced clearance
- **Increased free drug concentration:** reduced protein binding can result in increased availability of free drug
- Small increments should be used and titrated to effect
# Perioperative
## Pre-op
### History
- Gestational age at birth and the current gestational age
- Weight
- Periods of mechanical ventilation, CPAP and oxygen therapy and the duration
- Apnoeas–frequency, duration, possible triggers
- Co-morbidities, particularly cardiac
- General health, growth and development
- Previous operations
- Medications including oxygen
### Investigations
- A crossmatch should be taken where blood loss is anticipated to be greater than 10% of blood volume.
- All premature babies should have an echocardiogram performed
### Risk Stratifying
- In-hospital mortality five times higher in premature neonates undergoing non-cardiac surgery than term neonates
- Discuss the proposed interventions, with the surgical and NICU multidisciplinary teams and family, for clear understanding of the goals of therapy and ongoing concerns
- Location, staffing and timing of anaesthesia: Some procedures can be done in NICU. Transfer is high risk
- Assess airway and other systems for congenital abnormalities
## Intra Op
### Monitoring
- 2 oxygen saturation probes
- Patent PDA one should be placed on the right hand and one on the lower limb to compare pre ductal and post ductal levels.
- Dead space must also be minimised
### Induction
- IV: Fentanyl (1-5 mg/kg), propofol 3-5mg/kg or ketamine 1-2mg/kg and a NDMB
- Inhalational
- *Premedicate:* Atropine (20 mg/kg 1 i.v.) or glycopyrrolate (10 mg/kg i.v.) can attenuate the vagal response to intubation, which may be profound
### Intubation

| Gestation (weeks) | Weight (kg) | Blade size | Tube size (uncuffed) | Oral depth (cm) | Nasal depth (cm) |
|-------------------|-------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| <29               | <1          | 00         | 2.5                  | 5.5–6.5         | 7.0–7.5          |
| 30–35             | 1–2         | 0          | 3.0                  | 7.0–7.5         | 8.0–8.5          |
| >35               | >2          | 1          | 3.5                  | 8.0–9.0         | 9.0–10           |

- Tracheal preferred either oral or nasally.
- Neutral head position with shoulder roll because of large occiput
- Increased risk of difficult airway for <32 weeks or <1500 g
- LMA can be used from 1500g upwards
- VL with 00 blades available
- Smallest fibre optic: External diameter of 2.2 mm, which can accommodate a size 2.5 mm tracheal tube. However, it has a limited depth of field and lacks a suction port
- Front-of-neck access is virtually impossible. Elective tracheostomy may be possible in neonates >1.5 kg
- Rescue methods: Railroading the tracheal tube via a flexible or rigid bronchoscope, and high flow nasal oxygen can be used to optimise oxygenation between and during intubation attempts.
### Maintenance
- MAC requirements are lower than those of term neonates. TCI not available. Depth of anaesthesia monitoring only validated for 1year and upwards
### Ventilation
- Volume-targeted or pressure-limited.
- Tidal volumes of 5 ml/kg
- Ventilatory frequency: 30-60 bpm
- PEEP: 6-8cmH2O
- Titrate above to maintain normocapnia or mild hypercapnia  
- Titrate FIO2 to achieve SpO2 9095%
### Haemodynamics
- Cap refil, lactate and urine
- Cerebral and somatic near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and ultrasound. NIRS is validated in premature neonates and can be used to monitor cerebral and somatic oxygenation although outcome data are lacking
### Temperature
- Theatre above 25 degrees
### Analgesia
- Uncontrolled pain is widely thought to be detrimental to neurodevelopment
- Multimodal approach: Paracetamol (28-36 weeks: 7.5mg/kg; >36 weeks: 10mg/kg); Ketamine; Dexmedetomidine, Regional including spinal, epidurals, infusion catheters.
- NSAIDS contra-indicated due to renal immaturity
### Fluids
- Maintenance: Isotonic electrolyte solution with 1-2.5% glucose for maintenance at a rate of 10ml/kg/h  
- Ringers boluses of 10-20 ml/kg as required
- Hypoglycaemia (blood glucose <2.6 mmol L): 2mlkg 10% glucose.
### Transfusion
- Pre op HB target: 12. Only lower when not requiring mechanical ventilation or oxygen
- minimal evidence to guide plasma and platelet transfusions in premature infants, nor the use of cell salvage, tranexamic acid or point-of-care viscoelastic testing in non-cardiac surgery
## Post Op
- Apnoea monitoring for 24-48h after surgery is usual unless the infant is >50-60 weeks’ PMA and has no other risk factors for apnoea
