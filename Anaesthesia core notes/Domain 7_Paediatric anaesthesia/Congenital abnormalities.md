# Congenital Diseases and Anesthesia
## Introduction
### General Considerations

- **Difficult airway**: Many patients with genetic syndromes present with abnormal airway findings. Syndromes with mandibular hypoplasia (e.g., Pierre Robin, Treacher Collins, Goldenhar) and cleft lip/palate are common. A careful airway examination and review of previous anesthetics are crucial.
- **Congenital cardiac defects**: Syndromes associated with cardiac defects include VACTERL, CHARGE, trisomy 13, 18, and 21, as well as velocardiofacial syndromes. A thorough physical exam, echocardiogram review, and understanding of the cardiac anatomy/pathophysiology are essential.
- **Neuro-cognitive abnormalities**: Patients may be anxious and uncooperative, with possible cognitive deficits and increased sensitivity to anesthetics.
- **Positioning and vascular access issues**: Limb abnormalities can complicate positioning and vascular access.
- **Orthopedic abnormalities**: Scoliosis, hip dysplasia, and limb contractures are common in this population.
# Spina Bifida
## Background

- **Spina bifida** is a failure of the developing spine to fully enclose the neural elements within a bony canal and may be associated with Chiari II malformation.
### Types of Spina Bifida
#### Spina Bifida Occulta
- Failed fusion of the neural arch without herniation of the meninges or neural elements.
- Typically limited to one vertebra (L5 or S1).
- Common condition (5-36% of the population), often considered a normal variant.
#### Spina Bifida Cystica
- Involves herniation of meninges (meningocele) or both meninges and neural elements (myelomeningocele) through a vertebral defect.
### Myelomeningocele (MMC)

- **Most common form of neural tube defect (NTD)**, characterized by a cleft in the spinal column with a corresponding skin defect, leading to exposed spinal cord and meninges.
- Commonly located in the lower lumbosacral region (90%).
- Strong genetic inheritance with recurrence risks among siblings at 2-5% (20-50-fold increased risk).
- Risk factors: folate deficiency, antiepileptics, maternal fever, diabetes, and obesity. Pregnant women should be screened for NTDs between 18 and 22 weeks of gestation.
- Progressive neurological disease with orthopedic, neurologic, and genitourinary complications.
#### Conduct of Anesthesia for Myelomeningocele Repair

- **Urgency**: Requires surgery within the first day of life.
- **Position**: Prone with appropriate padding and eye protection.
- **Airway management**: Endotracheal tube (ETT) is preferred to avoid nasal pressure points when prone.
- **Environment**: Warmed operating theatre, fluid management, and forced-air warming (FAW).
- **Monitors**: Standard monitors unless other comorbidities are present.
- **Blood loss**: Discussion with the surgeon is necessary regarding the extent of surgery.
- **Postoperative care**: Apnea monitoring is necessary, ideally extubated post-surgery.
- **Analgesia**: Use local anesthesia and paracetamol; opioids are used cautiously due to apnea risk.

##### Associated Abnormalities
- **Chiari II malformation**: Herniation of cerebellar tonsils, brainstem dysfunction, and cognitive impairment.
- **Obstructive hydrocephalus**: 70-90% of patients develop this condition, often requiring ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting.
- **Neurological deficits**: Motor and sensory deficits causing lower limb paralysis or weakness.
- **Neurogenic bladder and bowel**: Incontinence, recurrent urinary tract infections, and constipation.
- **Orthopedic abnormalities**: Club foot, hip dysplasia, joint contractures, scoliosis.
- **Cognitive dysfunction**: Learning disabilities, attention deficits, and social isolation.
- **Sexual development**: Precocious puberty in females, erectile dysfunction in males.

##### Anesthetic Considerations for Postnatal Surgical Repair

###### Preoperative Investigations
- Full blood count (FBC), urea and electrolytes (UCE), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), renal and cranial ultrasound.

###### Intraoperative and Postoperative Care
- Latex precautions should be taken.
- Surgical repair is typically performed under general anesthesia, although spinal anesthesia has been reported in select cases.
- Avoid direct pressure on the MMC lesion during induction by using towels or positioning in the lateral decubitus position.
- Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors should be used.
- Postoperative ventilation in the prone position for 1-3 days may be necessary.
### Occult Spinal Dysraphism

- Intermediate group of conditions where the bony defect is associated with spinal cord anomalies (e.g., intraspinal lipomas, dermal sinus tracts, dermoid cysts, diastematomyelia).
- These lesions differ from spina bifida occulta.
- Neurologic symptoms may vary from none to sensory, motor, and functional deficits in the lower limbs, bladder, and bowel.
- Cutaneous stigmata (e.g., hair tufts, dimples, hyperpigmentation) are present in 50% of cases, and 70% have a tethered spinal cord.
## Considerations

- **Pre-anesthesia imaging**: Neuroimaging and detailed neurological assessment are recommended before neuraxial anesthesia. Physical signs such as hair tufts, dimples, or cutaneous lipomas over the spine may warrant imaging prior to anesthesia.
- **Central nervous system**: Patients may have hydrocephalus (increased intracranial pressure) or flaccid paralysis. Autonomic hyperreflexia is a risk if the lesion is between T5-T8.
- **Respiratory**: Scoliosis can cause restrictive lung disease and pulmonary hypertension.
- **Latex allergy**: Increased incidence in these patients.
### Pregnancy Considerations

#### Spina Bifida Occulta
- Neuraxial anesthesia is generally safe but should be performed away from any malformation identified on imaging.
- There is a higher risk of post-dural puncture headache.

#### Meningocele and Myelomeningocele
- For lesions at T11 or higher, labor may be painless.
- Epidural and spinal anesthesia have been successfully performed, but they can be difficult and unreliable.
- Epidural anesthesia may be considered to prevent autonomic hyperreflexia during labor.
# Abdominal Wall Defects

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311093209.png)

## Gastroschisis Vs Exomphalos
# Gastroschisis Vs Omphalocele

## Omphalocele

- **Definition**: Herniation of abdominal cavity contents into the umbilical cord (bowel +/- spleen, liver, ovaries).
- **Membrane**: Yes (covered by Wharton's jelly, peritoneum, and amnion).
- **Incidence**: 1 in 13,000.
- **Congenital Defects**:
	- Cardiac (20%; atrial septal defect [ASD], tetralogy of Fallot [TOF])
	- Chromosomal trisomies
	- Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (characteristics include macroglossia, gigantism, and pancreatic islet hyperplasia)
	- Pentalogy of Cantrell (involving diaphragmatic hernia, septal, pericardial, and cardiac defects)
	- Lower midline syndrome
- **Associations**: Prematurity and low birth weight (LBW).
- **Surgical Urgency**: Elective (unless ruptured).

## Gastroschisis

- **Definition**: Herniation of bowel into a small abdominal wall defect to the right side of a normal umbilicus.
- **Membrane**: No.
- **Incidence**: 1 in 8,000.
- **Congenital Defects**: Less frequently associated with congenital defects, primarily affecting the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Associations**: Prematurity, LBW, maternal smoking and aspirin use, and lower maternal age.
- **Surgical Urgency**: Within hours of birth.
# Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia

## Conduct of Anesthesia

- **Avoid Bagging**: Directly bagging the patient can fill the stomach with air, worsening the condition.
- **Ventilation Strategy**: Use a T-piece to assess lung compliance. Aim for peak inspiratory pressures below 25 cm H2O and a PEEP of 3-5 cm H2O. Permissive hypercapnia is expected with a respiratory rate (RR) between 40-60 breaths per minute.
- **Minimize Dead Space**: Address rising PCO2, which indicates difficult ventilation and potential CO2 insufflation in the affected hemidiaphragm.
- **Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)**: Risk of worsening PAH. Treat triggers proactively and have nitric oxide available in the theater.
- **Fluid Management**: Avoid overhydration, which can lead to pulmonary congestion.
- **Supportive Therapy**: Vasopressors and inotropes may be necessary to maintain adequate organ perfusion.
- **Postoperative Care**: ICU monitoring post-operation.
- **Additional Measures**: If peak pressures are too high, consider decompressing the stomach with a nasogastric tube (NGT), using high-frequency oscillation ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as needed.
## Diagnosis and Treatment

### Prenatal

- **Ultrasound (US)**: Early detection via ultrasound.
- **Fetoscopic Endoluminal Tracheal Occlusion (FETO)**: An experimental procedure that involves occluding the fetal trachea to prevent fluid efflux from the lungs, promoting lung development.
### Postnatal

- **Clinical Presentation**: Respiratory distress, scaphoid abdomen (indicative of abdominal content herniation into the thoracic cavity).
- **Initial Management**:
	- **Intubation**: Utilize protective lung ventilation strategies such as PEEP of 3-5 cm H2O, peak inspiratory pressure no more than 25 cm H2O, and acceptance of permissive hypercapnia.
	- **Nasogastric Tube (NGT)**: Decompress the stomach to reduce pressure on the diaphragm.
	- **Echocardiogram**: Assess for pulmonary arterial hypertension and possible cardiac defects.
- **Medical Therapy**:
	- **Pulmonary Artery Vasodilators**: To manage PAH.
	- **Inotropes/Vasopressors**: To optimize perfusion.
	- **Neuromuscular Blocking Agents (NMBAs)**: May be used to synchronize ventilation if necessary.
	- **Advanced Ventilation Techniques**: Consider high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) if persistent hypercapnia and hypoxia are present.
	- **Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)**: Considered as a rescue strategy if conventional management fails, prior to surgical intervention.
## Survival Prediction
### Classification of CDH According to Size of Defect

- **Type A**: Small defects entirely surrounded by muscle.
- **Type B**: Less than 50% of the chest wall with absent diaphragmatic tissue.
- **Type C**: More than 50% of the chest wall with absent diaphragmatic tissue.
- **Type D**: Complete absence of hemidiaphragm.

#### Additional Factors Affecting Prognosis

- Birth weight under 1.5 kg
- Apgar score at 5 minutes less than 7
- Presence of chromosomal abnormalities
- Major cardiac abnormalities
- Suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension detected on echocardiography
  
**Note**: Larger defect sizes correlate with poorer outcomes. The above factors have been validated as a scoring system to stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories.
### Antenatal and Postnatal Prognostic Indicators in CDH
#### Antenatal Indicators of Poor Prognosis

- Liver herniation
- Early gestational age at diagnosis
- Associated cardiac or chromosomal anomalies
- Observed-to-expected Lung Area to Head Circumference Ratio (LHR) < 25%

## Considerations for Anesthesia and Airway Management

### Airway Challenges

- **Potential Difficult Airway**: Special attention is needed, especially during bag mask ventilation. A careful airway plan is mandatory to avoid complications. Ensure that the direct laryngoscope does not enter the cleft to prevent further complications.
	- Risks for difficult airway
		- Syndromic
		- Bilateral cleft lip
		- Retrognathia
		- Micrognathia
		- <6 months old
		- Left sided cleft
- **Swallowing Dysfunction**: Risk of aspiration (lung soiling) and restrictive lung disease due to swallowing difficulties, often compounded by malnutrition.
- **Associated Conditions**: Common associations include craniofacial disorders such as Pierre-Robin sequence and congenital heart disease, which is present in about 20% of these cases.
- **Postoperative Airway Complications**: Increased risk of laryngospasm, edema, and obstruction post-surgery, which may complicate airway management further.

### Goals of Anesthesia Management

- **Airway Assessment**: Detailed evaluation of the airway for bag mask ventilation and laryngoscopy, establishing a sequential airway management plan.
- **Evaluation of Associated Conditions**: Thorough screening for congenital heart disease and other congenital anomalies.
- **Postoperative Airway Safety**: Ensure safe management of the airway post-operatively to avoid complications.
## Risks for Postoperative Complications

- **Bilateral and Wide Clefts**: These present more significant challenges and higher risk for complications.
- **Feeding Difficulties**: Can exacerbate malnutrition and affect overall recovery.
- **Recurrent Respiratory Tract Infections (RTI)**: Increases the risk of postoperative respiratory complications.

## Management of Postoperative Airway Obstruction

### Typical Causes

- **Tongue Swelling**: Often due to irritation from intubation and the surgical procedure itself, particularly swelling from the gag reflex.

### Intervention Strategies

- **Mild Cases**: Administration of simple positive pressure may suffice to alleviate mild cases of airway obstruction.
- **Positioning**: Placing the patient in the left lateral or prone position can help alleviate obstruction.
- **Mechanical Interventions**:
	- **Tongue Forward Technique**: Physically pulling the tongue forward or using a stitch to keep it in place.
	- **Nasopharyngeal Airway (NPA)**: Insertion can help maintain airway patency.
- **Re-intubation**: Consider early re-intubation if there is a significant concern about ongoing swelling; proactive management is crucial as the tongue may continue to swell.
- **Tracheostomy**: In severe cases where other measures fail, a tracheostomy may be required to secure the airway.

## Nerve Blocks
### CL Repair: Infraorbital Nerve Blocks

- **Efficacy and Safety**: Infraorbital nerve blocks can effectively provide postoperative analgesia for up to 19 hours without the risk of respiratory depression when using adrenaline-containing bupivacaine. Bilateral blocks are considered safe^3.
	
- **Comparative Analgesia**: Studies suggest that these blocks offer better analgesia and longer duration compared to peri-incisional infiltration and are also superior to fentanyl titrations^9.
	
- **Anatomy and Technique**:
	
	- **Sensory Supply**: The infraorbital nerve provides sensation to the skin and mucous membranes of the upper lip, lower eyelid, cheek, and the alae nasi^3.
	- **Block Technique**: The nerve block can be performed either intra-orally or extra-orally. When using the extra-oral approach, a small gauge needle is placed superficially to the infraorbital foramen bilaterally, with a recommended dose of 0.25%-0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline^9.

### CP Repair: Maxillary Nerve Blocks

- **Block Techniques**:
	- **Approaches**: The maxillary nerve can be blocked via three different methods: intra-orally by blocking the palatine nerves, or externally using either an infrayzogomatic or a suprazygomatic approach^9.
- **Innervation**:
	- **Sensory Areas**: The maxillary nerve innervates the lower eyelid, the upper lip, the skin between them, the roof of the mouth, and the palate^4.
## Down Syndrome

![](Pasted%20image%2020240311161135.png)

### Anesthetic Considerations for Patients with Down's Syndrome
#### Considerations

- **Atlanto-axial and Atlanto-occipital Instability**: Risk of neurologic injury with neck manipulation.
- **Airway Management Challenges**:
	- Difficult bag mask ventilation potential due to anatomical variations such as large tongue, increased oropharyngeal soft tissue, small mouth, subglottic stenosis, and a high arched palate.
	- Tonsillar and adenoid hypertrophy may complicate airway management.
- **Respiratory Concerns**:
	- Obstructive sleep apnea leading to complications such as pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction.
- **Sensitivity to Sedatives and Hypnotics**: Heightened sensitivity necessitates cautious dosing.
- **Behavioral and Developmental Considerations**:
	- Developmental delays and potential cooperation challenges during procedures.
- **Cardiac Concerns**:
	- High incidence of associated congenital heart diseases (up to 50%), including atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) which is the most common, followed by ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), and tetralogy of Fallot (TOF); pulmonary hypertension is also prevalent.
#### Other Medical Issues

- **Metabolic and Systemic Concerns**:
	- Increased risk of obesity, accelerated coronary disease, valvulopathy (including mitral valve prolapse and aortic insufficiency), and hypothyroidism.
- **Gastrointestinal Complications**:
	- Potential for duodenal atresia or stenosis, tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), Hirschsprung's disease, and celiac disease.
- **Hematological Concerns**:
	- Conditions such as polycythemia, leukemia, and immune deficiencies are more common.
- **Musculoskeletal Concerns**:
	- Joint laxity necessitates careful positioning to prevent injury.
- **Neurological Concerns**:
	- Early onset Alzheimer’s dementia requires specific considerations for long-term care and anesthesia management.
#### Goals

- **Atlanto-axial Instability Management**:
	- Thorough neurologic examination and history, along with flexion-extension views of the cervical spine to rule out instability.
- **Airway Management**:
	- Preparation with airway adjuncts like video laryngoscope and considerations for skin topicalization to facilitate IV start.
- **Sedation Strategy**:
	- Use of sedatives like midazolam, noting potential paradoxical reactions. Consider alternatives or adjustments in dosing.
- **Postoperative Monitoring**:
	- Arrangements for enhanced post-operative monitoring including overnight oximetry to manage respiratory complications.
#### Conflicts and Resolutions

- **Unstable Cervical Spine vs. Behavioral Challenges**:
	- Balancing the need for immobility due to cervical spine instability against the patient’s potential uncooperative nature. Use of IM/PO sedation such as Ketamine (5 mg/kg IM, 7 mg/kg PO) and Midazolam (0.5 mg/kg PO with a maximum dose of 20 mg) to facilitate IV placement.
- **Anesthetic Induction Concerns**:
	- Inhalational induction may be problematic due to issues like obesity and obstructive sleep apnea. Adjustments in the anesthetic approach may be necessary to ensure patient safety and cooperation.
# Osteogenesis Imperfecta

## Background

	- High incidence of cephalopelvic disproportion necessitating mandatory cesarean section
	- Higher incidence of intrapartum and postpartum hemorrhage
- **Increased risk**:
	- Uterine rupture
	- Pelvic fracture
- **Difficult airway management**:
	- Even more challenging in pregnant patients
	- Succinylcholine can cause bone fractures; consider using a defasciculating non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (NdMR) or rocuronium
- **Potential contraindication to regional anesthesia**:
	- Due to platelet dysfunction
	- If patient history is reassuring and platelet count/INR/PTT are within normal limits, regional anesthesia may be considered

	- Titrated epidural anesthesia is preferred due to unpredictable spinal spread
	- Epidural placement may be challenging due to anatomical anomalies
# Special Needs
### Anaesthesia Strategies for Children with Special Needs

A flexible and holistic approach is vital when managing children with special needs. This requires collaboration across specialties, coordination of interventions, and specific consideration of communication and premedication strategies. The patient’s family plays an essential role in this process, and understanding their needs is crucial for effective care.

#### Preoperative Care

1. **Assessment**
	
	- **Advance Notification**: Systems should be in place to notify the anaesthetic team in advance if a child with special needs will be attending for surgery, allowing time to assess and meet their specific requirements.
	- **Checklist**: A pre-admission checklist should assess physical and psychological needs, mobility, communication methods, likes, dislikes, and phobias. This can be completed over the phone or by a parent visiting the hospital in advance.
	- **Preparation and Communication**: Information about the child’s routines and communication methods, such as a ‘communication passport,’ is invaluable. Efforts should be made to gather this information before admission to minimize fasting times and arrange a quiet waiting area.
	- **Comfort Items**: Families should be encouraged to bring toys or comfort items from home to help calm the child.
2. **Preparation**
	
	- **Tailored Information**: Traditional patient information resources may be unsuitable for children with special needs. Time should be taken to assess the child’s understanding and communication methods to ease the perioperative period.
	- **Familiar Carer Presence**: For children with low cognitive abilities, the presence of a familiar carer is especially important.
3. **Communication Support**
	
	- **AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication)**: Children may use various forms of AAC, such as sign language or picture boards, to aid communication during anaesthetic procedures.
4. **Premedication**
	
	- **Local Anaesthetic Cream**: Topical anaesthetics for IV cannulation should be considered but may not be tolerated by all. In these cases, inhalation induction followed by cannulation may be an option.
	- **Oral Sedatives**: Children with special needs often require sedative premedication to manage anxiety and ensure cooperation. Oral premedication may be disguised in food or drink if necessary.
	- **Premedication before Hospital**: Occasionally, premedication (e.g., lorazepam) may be given before hospital admission, but this requires careful planning with the parents.

##### Premedication Regimens for Children with Special Needs

| Drug                     | Route | Dose                                       | Maximum Dose | Onset Time |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| **Midazolam**            | P.O.  | 0.25–1 mg/kg                               | 20 mg        | 20–30 min  |
| **Ketamine**             | P.O.  | 3–5 mg/kg                                  | N/A          | 30–60 min  |
| **Ketamine**             | I.M.  | 1–2 mg/kg                                  | N/A          | 3 min      |
| **Midazolam + Ketamine** | P.O.  | 0.5 mg/kg (Midazolam) + 3 mg/kg (Ketamine) | 20 mg        | 30 min     |
| **Clonidine**            | P.O.  | 4 µg/kg                                    | 150 µg       | 45–60 min  |
| **Lorazepam**            | P.O.  | 50–100 µg/kg                               | 4 mg         | 60 min     |
|                          |       |                                            |              |            |

#### Preoperative Care

- **Simplified Anaesthesia Plan**: Despite the need for premedication, it is essential to maintain a simple, flexible anaesthetic approach. Local anaesthetics, paracetamol, and NSAIDs should be used liberally.
- **Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)**: Administer antiemetics early, alongside isotonic fluids, to minimize nausea, especially since children with special needs may struggle to communicate discomfort.
- **Distress Management**: Causes of postoperative distress can include pain, nausea, emergence delirium, and unfamiliar environments. Careful observation and pain management are essential.
#### Postoperative Care

- **Rapid Recovery and Early Discharge**: Aim for smooth, quick recovery and discharge. IV cannulas should be removed as soon as possible to prevent distress.
- **Adapted Discharge Criteria**: Discharge may proceed without the usual criteria (e.g., eating, drinking) as long as the child has returned to their baseline functioning.
- **Pain Management**: For non-verbal children, behavioral pain scales and input from carers are necessary. Nurse-controlled analgesia is preferable for children unable to use patient-controlled systems.
#### Communication Strategies

Effective communication is critical to providing high-quality care. This may involve using alternative methods for children with limited verbal communication abilities, such as:

- **Sign Language (e.g., Makaton)**: Helps with basic communication.
- **Symbol Charts/Picture Boards**: Particularly useful for children with communication difficulties.
- **Social Stories**: These provide a way to help children with ASD understand new social situations by describing what will happen during their hospital stay.
- **Simple Language**: Use clear, simple words and avoid jargon, sarcasm, metaphors, or complex instructions.
- **Symbol Timelines**: Breaking down steps into manageable, illustrated sequences can reduce anxiety and give children a sense of control.
#### Autism Dos and Don’ts

|**Dos**|**Don’ts**|
|---|---|
|Minimize waiting times|Allow prolonged waits in noisy environments|
|Warn before making physical contact|Initiate physical contact without consent|
|Gather information from parents/carers|Make assumptions about understanding or cooperation|
|Speak quietly and gently|Raise your voice|
|Recognize the patient may not wish to communicate|Assume a lack of communication equals lack of understanding|
|Offer preferred foods|Use complex language or metaphors|
|Provide clear explanations|Spring surprises – routine is vital|
|Minimize disruption to routine||
|Provide a clear plan for the day||

#### Restraint

Physical restraint should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and skilled carers should be involved in therapeutic holding if needed. Record the child’s response to induction and recovery to aid future anaesthetic care.

## Perioperative Management of Inherited Metabolic Disorders (IMDs)
### Preoperative Considerations
1. **Multidisciplinary Approach:**
   - Elective surgeries should occur in hospitals equipped with a comprehensive multidisciplinary team and intensive care facilities.
   - Collaborate with the metabolic team for preoperative assessment.
   - Review previous anaesthetic records for insights.

2. **Assessment and Preparation:**
   - Postpone surgery if significant coexisting infections are present to avoid metabolic decompensation.
   - Evaluate cardiac and respiratory systems affected by the IMD. Utilize ECG and recent echocardiograms to assess heart function.
   - Assess myopathy's degree and distribution. Include tests like full blood count, renal function, electrolytes, arterial blood gas analysis, and serum glucose.

3. **Dietary and Medication Adjustments:**
   - Address significant metabolic acidosis preoperatively, potentially using peritoneal or hemodialysis.
   - Maintain special or restrictive diets and continue all supplemental cofactors such as carnitine, glycine (for isovaleric acidaemia), sodium benzoate, and sodium phenylacetate (for urea cycle defects).

4. **Surgical Scheduling and Fasting:**
   - Minimize perioperative fasting to reduce metabolic decompensation risk.
   - Prioritize IMD patients early in the operating schedule.
   - Administer fluids containing 10% glucose at the commencement of fasting and consider i.v. fat emulsion to reduce glucose load. Permit high carbohydrate energy drinks up to 2 hours before surgery.

5. **Sedation and Emergency Protocols:**
   - Use sedative premedication cautiously, especially in patients with airway complications like those with MPS.
   - Prefer transferring emergency cases to specialist centers for coordinated care.
### Intraoperative Considerations

1. **Medication and Fluid Management:**
   - Avoid succinylcholine in myopathic children due to the risk of hyperkalemia.
   - Use respiratory depressants and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents carefully.
   - Refrain from using lactate-containing fluids in cases of lactic acidosis. Administer bicarbonate as necessary.

2. **Surgical Environment and Monitoring:**
   - Ensure proper patient positioning, particularly noting any bone or joint diseases like cervical spine instability (e.g., MPS).
   - Monitor arterial blood gases, serum electrolyte, blood glucose, and, if necessary, ammonia levels during prolonged surgeries.

3. **Procedure-Specific Precautions:**
   - Use nasogastric tubes or throat packs during surgeries with potential oral or intestinal blood loss to avoid protein load from blood in the gastrointestinal tract, which could trigger acute decompensation.

4. **Use of Anesthetics:**
   - Limit the use of nitrous oxide, which has been associated with adverse effects in several IMDs such as megaloblastic anaemia in phenylketonuria, inhibition of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in MMA, and inhibition of methionine synthase in homocystinuria.
### Postoperative Considerations

1. **Monitoring and Recovery:**
   - Monitor patients closely post-anesthesia in a high-dependency setting due to increased risk of metabolic or clinical deterioration.
   - Regularly monitor acid-base status and plasma ammonia to detect any decompensation early.

2. **Diet and Management:**
   - Reinstitute the patient’s specialized diet as soon as feasible post-anesthesia.
   - Typically, IMD patients should not be managed on a day-case basis due to their special needs and risk profiles.
### Perioperative Management for Organic Acidaemias: Propionic and Methylmalonic Acidaemia

#### Biochemical Pathway

- **Propionic and Methylmalonic Acidaemia** involve the breakdown of certain amino acids and fatty acids into succinyl-CoA within the mitochondria through the propionate pathway:
	- **Propionyl-CoA** is converted into methylmalonic acid by **propionyl-CoA carboxylase**, using biotin.
	- **Methylmalonyl-CoA** is then transformed into succinyl-CoA by **methylmalonyl-CoA mutase**, with cobalamin (vitamin B12) as a cofactor.
	- Succinyl-CoA enters the **citric acid cycle**, breaking down into carbon dioxide and water.
#### Clinical Presentation and Acute Decompensation

- These conditions may manifest with acute decompensation, triggered often by catabolic stress like infection. Clinical features include:
	- Tachypnea, dehydration, vomiting, lethargy
	- Hyperglycinemia (due to inhibition of glycine cleavage)
	- Ketoacidosis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia
	- Hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis
	- Hyperammonemia (from inhibition of carbamyl phosphate synthetase)
#### Treatment Approaches

- **Dietary Management:** Implement a protein-restricted diet.
- **Supplemental Treatment:**
	- Use carnitine to help eliminate organic acids via urine.
	- Administer biotin in propionic acidaemia and vitamin B12 in methylmalonic acidaemia.
- **Acute Crisis Management:**
	- Rehydrate patients and aggressively treat any infections.
	- Prevent catabolism and manage acidosis and hyperammonemia.
	- In severe cases, consider peritoneal or hemodialysis for high ammonia levels.
	- Liver transplantation is a potential curative treatment as it provides the deficient enzymes.
#### Perioperative Care Specifics for IMDs

- The general perioperative considerations for inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) are particularly pertinent to patients with organic acidaemias, focusing on careful monitoring and management of metabolic balance to avoid decompensation during the stress of surgery.
### Perioperative Care for Glycogen Storage Diseases (GSD)

#### Metabolic Overview

- **GSDs** involve defects in glycogen metabolism, preventing glucose mobilization, leading to excessive glycogen accumulation in liver and muscle tissues. Management is geared towards maintaining euglycemic states and providing alternative energy sources:
	- For infants, regular snacking and nocturnal glucose feeds are common.
	- Older children may benefit from uncooked cornstarch.
	- Pompe disease can be treated with recombinant human alpha-glucosidase.
#### Specific Anaesthetic Considerations

- **Fasting Management:** Minimize fasting to prevent hypoglycemia; monitor blood glucose closely and administer glucose-containing fluids perioperatively.
- **Disease-Specific Precautions:**
	- Assess renal function and platelets in von Gierke disease.
	- Check coagulation and liver function in Andersen disease due to potential hepatic cirrhosis.
	- Preoperative cardiac assessment is crucial in diseases like Cori, Andersen, and Tarui, especially for Pompe disease due to risks of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
# Syndromic Child
### Introduction

When faced with a syndromic child presenting for surgery, the anaesthetist must be familiar with potential issues related to the specific syndrome. This article will highlight ways in which various body systems may be affected. The systems most relevant to anaesthetists are outlined in **Table 1**. Given that both the heart, great vessels, and airways are frequently involved in syndromes, it is useful to understand their shared embryological origins.

### Embryology

Structures of the mandible, ear, and neck originate from the pharyngeal (branchial) arches. The embryo possesses six pharyngeal arches that are closely situated near the developing heart field. Each pharyngeal arch contains an artery, nerve, and cartilage, forming the "arch arteries," which are precursors to major blood vessels, including the aorta, pulmonary arteries, right subclavian artery, and common and internal carotid arteries (see **Table 2**). These arches are separated by invaginations known as "pouches" on the endodermal side and "clefts" on the ectodermal side.

- The first three arches form structures above the larynx.
- The fourth and sixth arches contribute to the larynx and trachea.
- The fifth arch regresses in humans without contributing to any anatomical structures (see **Table 3**).

The term “first arch syndrome” refers to conditions involving coexisting abnormalities of the eyes, ears, palate, and jaw. Syndromes under this category include **Treacher Collins syndrome** and **Pierre Robin sequence**.

### Neural Crest Cells

Neural crest cells are progenitor cells that migrate early in embryogenesis from the neural crest into the pharyngeal arches, contributing to the development of many tissues in the head and face. These cells are essential for the differentiation of tissues and the septation of the **conotruncus** as well as the patterning of the arch arteries. Abnormalities in neural crest cell migration, formation, or differentiation may lead to a variety of defects, including craniofacial anomalies and cardiovascular malformations.

One notable condition caused by defective neural crest cell migration through the pharyngeal apparatus is **22q11 deletion syndrome** (e.g., **DiGeorge syndrome**). This condition involves:

- **Shortened mandible** (first arch),
- **Ear defects** (first and second arches),
- **Parathyroid and thymic defects** (third and fourth pouches),
- **Cardiac and conotruncal defects** (third, fourth, and sixth arches).
### Spine

Many syndromic conditions are associated with spinal abnormalities, which may result in scoliosis or pose concerns for regional anaesthesia. One particularly critical issue is **atlantoaxial instability**, which can have life-threatening implications

#### Achondroplasia

Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant condition causing disproportionate dwarfism. Patients with achondroplasia may present with airway and ventilation difficulties due to:

- Large head,
- Midface hypoplasia,
- Macroglossia (potentially leading to upper airway obstruction),
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease, and
- Hypotonia during infancy.

Spinal abnormalities include:

- **Thoracolumbar gibbus**,
- Exaggerated **lumbar lordosis**,
- **Kyphosis** with restrictive lung disease,
- **Spinal stenosis**, which raises concerns for regional anaesthesia.

Additionally, **foramen magnum stenosis** or atlantoaxial instability may occur, sometimes accompanied by central sleep apnoea, which may be fatal.

#### Morquio Syndrome

Morquio syndrome, a glycogen storage disorder, is characterized by:

- Short trunk and neck,
- Midface hypoplasia,
- **Obstructive sleep apnoea**, and
- **Kyphoscoliosis**, potentially leading to life-threatening **cor pulmonale**.
### Airway

The airway and respiratory system are frequently affected in syndromic conditions. Given the common embryological origins, anomalies of the ears often correspond with upper airway abnormalities. **Congenital micrognathia**, a condition where the lower jaw is underdeveloped, is much more commonly associated with a syndrome than occurring in isolation. **Obstructive sleep apnoea** is a common complication, especially when micrognathia is associated with glossoptosis.

Three syndromes known for difficult intubation are:

- Pierre Robin sequence,
- Treacher Collins syndrome, and
- Goldenhar syndrome.
#### Pierre Robin Sequence

This condition involves severe micrognathia, posterior displacement of the tongue, and cleft lip/palate. Patients may also experience **vagal hyperactivity** and **central apnoea**. Pierre Robin sequence may be associated with syndromes such as **22q11 deletion syndrome** and **Down syndrome**.

#### Treacher Collins Syndrome

Treacher Collins syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder featuring:

- **Hypoplasia of facial bones,**
- **Down-slanting eyes,**
- **Ear abnormalities,**
- **Cleft lip and palate, and**
- **Coloboma of the lower eyelids.**
#### Goldenhar Syndrome

Also known as **oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia** and **hemifacial microsomia**, Goldenhar syndrome results in facial asymmetry due to:

- **Mandibular hypoplasia,**
- **Ear and/or eye deformities, and**
- **Vertebral anomalies.**

Other associated conditions may include:

- **Cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal, and CNS involvement**,
- **Cleft lip/palate**, and
- **Temporomandibular joint anomalies**.
Atlantoaxial instability is also a significant risk in these patients.
#### Macroglossia

Macroglossia, which can complicate airway management, is associated with conditions such as **Down syndrome**, **Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome**, **Apert syndrome**, **Crouzon syndrome**, and **mucopolysaccharidoses** (e.g., **Hunter’s syndrome** and **Hurler’s syndrome**).

For patients with cleft lip and/or palate, the incidence of associated anomalies varies:

- 10% of isolated cleft lips are associated with other abnormalities,
- 25% for cleft lip and palate,
- 45% for isolated cleft palate.
Bilateral clefts are more frequently associated with other anomalies than unilateral clefts.
### Heart

Cardiac lesions in syndromic children may be congenital or acquired. Acquired lesions are often secondary to primary syndromic conditions, as seen in **connective tissue disorders**, **osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)**, and **mucopolysaccharidoses**. Up to 35% of children with surgically correctable congenital anomalies (e.g., cleft lip or palate) may have undiagnosed cardiac anomalies, such as **atrial septal defects** and **ventricular septal defects**, based on echocardiography studies.

Certain syndromes are associated with heart defects, particularly involving the **conotruncus** and great vessels (see **Table 5**).

#### Williams Syndrome

Patients with **Williams syndrome** (partial deletion of chromosome 7) can present with:

- Coronary artery stenoses,
- Other arterial stenoses,
- Hypercalcaemia,
- Hypothyroidism, and
- Developmental delay.

The combination of **ventricular outflow obstruction** and **coronary disease** can lead to sudden death, particularly during anaesthesia.

#### Noonan Syndrome

Noonan syndrome has a similar phenotype to **Turner syndrome**, with features such as:

- Webbed neck,
- Low hairline,
- Hypertelorism,
- Short stature,
- Micrognathia, and
- Kyphosis.

Unlike Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome is an **autosomal dominant disorder** and may involve significant vertebral anomalies, including **spina bifida**, **hemivertebrae**, and a **narrow spinal canal**. Coagulation defects may also be present.

#### Turner Syndrome

Patients with Turner syndrome may have:

- Cardiac defects,
- Cleft palate,
- Renal defects,
- Endocrine dysfunction, and
- A predisposition to osteoporosis.
### Coagulation

Patients with Noonan syndrome and those with connective tissue disorders may exhibit coagulation abnormalities.

#### Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI)

OI is a connective tissue disorder typically inherited in an **autosomal dominant** manner. Defective collagen formation in OI patients places them at risk for fractures, even during minor events such as positioning or blood pressure cuff inflation. These patients may also present with:

- Micrognathia,
- Abnormal teeth,
- Short neck,
- Pectus excavatum,
- Scoliosis,
- Joint laxity,
- Conductive hearing loss, and
- Blue sclerae.

There are four types of OI with varying severities, ranging from fatal to mild forms with osteoporosis. Cardiac lesions such as **aortic root dilatation** may develop. Coagulation issues may arise due to:

- Capillary fragility,
- Decreased factor VIII production, and
- Reduced platelet aggregation.

Approximately 50% of OI patients have elevated thyroxine levels, with heart rates, respiratory rates, and body temperatures above the normal range. **Hypermetabolic reactions to anaesthesia** have been reported, though the cause of temperature elevation during anaesthesia is not always clear.

### Metabolic and Endocrine Derangements

#### Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is characterized by:

- Macroglossia,
- Omphalocele or umbilical hernia,
- Gigantism,
- Visceromegaly, and
- Cryptorchidism.

Patients are predisposed to developing malignancies and may present with:

- Cardiac and skeletal anomalies,
- Hypoglycaemia,
- Hypercholesterolaemia, and
- Congenital hypothyroidism.
#### Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)
**Hypothyroidism** is a well-known risk for patients with Down syndrome and can develop at any stage. Thyroid function should be tested at birth, at six months, and annually thereafter . **Hyperthyroidism** may also occur, along with risks of **immunosuppression**, **autoimmune disorders**, **diabetes**, and **leukaemia**.
#### Williams Syndrome

Williams syndrome is associated with **hypercalcaemia** and **hypothyroidism**.

#### 22q11 Deletion Syndrome (DiGeorge Syndrome)

Patients may exhibit **hypocalcaemia** due to **hypoparathyroidism**, as well as **congenital hypothyroidism**.

### Neuromuscular Disorders

Syndromic children often present with cognitive, behavioural, and neuromuscular disorders, including **myopathies**, which present concerns such as airway complications, bulbar muscle dysfunction, and impaired respiratory and cardiac function. There is also an increased sensitivity to anaesthetic agents, with the potential for:

- Hypermetabolic crisis,
- Acute rhabdomyolysis, and
- Malignant hyperthermia.
#### Dystrophinopathies (Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy)

Patients with **dystrophinopathies** may develop acute rhabdomyolysis, particularly in younger children who have less muscle fibrosis. These patients are at increased risk for anaesthetic complications, and the use of inhalational agents and **succinylcholine** should be avoided.

#### Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase II Deficiency

Patients with **carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency** may experience acute rhabdomyolysis in response to exercise, fasting, stress, and infection. It is recommended to avoid **inhalational agents** and **succinylcholine** in these patients.

#### Familial Periodic Paralyses

Of the **familial periodic paralyses**, only patients with **hypokalaemic periodic paralysis** are at risk of hypermetabolic crisis or malignant hyperthermia.

#### Congenital Myopathies

Two congenital myopathies, **central core disease** and a subset of **multiminicore myopathy**, have a heightened risk of malignant hyperthermia.

#### King-Denborough Syndrome

This syndrome presents with a phenotype similar to **Noonan syndrome**, along with **congenital myopathy**, proximal muscle weakness, and a high risk of **malignant hyperthermia**.

#### Native American Myopathy

Patients with **Native American myopathy** exhibit features such as:

- Cleft palate,
- High-arched palate,
- Micrognathia,
- Myopathic facies,
- Short stature,
- Scoliosis,
- Cryptorchidism,
- Arthrogryposis, and
- Clubbed feet.
These patients are also at high risk of **malignant hyperthermia**.
### Down Syndrome
**Down syndrome (Trisomy 21)** occurs in approximately 1 in 800 live births. Common features include:
- Macroglossia,
- Hypotonia,
- Midface hypoplasia, and
- Short neck, all of which can contribute to obstructive sleep apnoea and airway difficulties during anaesthesia induction.

Other airway abnormalities include:

- Laryngomalacia,
- Tracheomalacia,
- Bronchomalacia,
- Narrow trachea, and
- Tracheal bronchus.

The incidence of **subglottic stenosis** may necessitate the use of a smaller-than-expected endotracheal tube. Patients with Down syndrome also have an overactive **vagal tone**, making them prone to **bradycardia** during anaesthesia.

A review of anaesthetic complications found that patients with Down syndrome are at risk of:

- Severe bradycardia,
- Natural airway obstruction,
- Difficult intubation,
- Post-intubation croup, and
- Bronchospasm.

Additionally, **atlantoaxial subluxation** and **alveolar hypoplasia** are other airway concerns.

#### Cardiac Abnormalities

Approximately 40–50% of patients with Down syndrome have **cardiac abnormalities**, with 80% involving **atrioventricular septal defects** or **ventriculoseptal defects**. Other potential cardiac issues include:

- **Mitral valve prolapse**,
- **Aortic incompetence**, and
- A tendency to develop **pulmonary hypertension**.

**Radial artery abnormalities** may pose challenges when placing arterial cannulas.
#### Other Concerns
- **Duodenal atresia** occurs in 30% of neonates with Down syndrome.
- **Immunosuppression**, **autoimmune disorders**, **diabetes**, and a predisposition to **leukaemia** are common in patients with Down syndrome.
### 22q11 Deletion Syndrome

**22q11 deletion syndrome** (DiGeorge syndrome) has an incidence of 1:4,000–1:6,000 live births and is characterized by a wide spectrum of phenotypes. Common features can be summarized by the acronym “CATCH 22”:
- Cardiac abnormalities,
- Abnormal facies,
- Thymic hypoplasia,
- Cleft palate, and
- Hypocalcaemia.
#### Airway Abnormalities

Airway abnormalities in 22q11 deletion syndrome include:

- Short trachea,
- Laryngomalacia,
- Tracheomalacia, and
- Bronchomalacia.

**Pierre Robin sequence** occurs in 11–17% of patients. Other common complications include **obstructive sleep apnoea** and **velopharyngeal dysfunction**, the latter affecting up to 80% of patients, which increases the risk of airway and respiratory complications.
#### Cardiac Lesions

Only 20% of patients with 22q11 deletion syndrome have normal hearts. Testing for the syndrome is recommended when certain cardiac lesions are diagnosed, such as:

- Tetralogy of Fallot (especially with pulmonary atresia),
- Truncus arteriosus,
- Interrupted aortic arch, and
- Perimembranous ventricular septal defect with concurrent aortic arch anomaly.
#### Immune Deficiency
**T-cell deficiency** due to **thymic hypoplasia** is present in up to 80% of patients, leading to recurrent infections and autoimmune diseases. These patients are at risk of **graft-versus-host disease** when receiving blood transfusions, necessitating the use of **irradiated blood**.

#### Hypocalcaemia and Neurocognitive Disorders
**Parathyroid hypoplasia** causes **hypocalcaemia**, which is one of the few causes of neonatal hypocalcaemia. Although hypocalcaemia typically improves in the first year of life, there are reports of new-onset hypocalcaemia in adults.

Neurocognitive disorders include **learning disabilities**, **attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder**, and **autism**. **Schizophrenia** develops in up to 25% of patients with 22q11 deletion syndrome.
