# Neurophysiology
## CBF
- **Varies with age**
	- Newborn: 40ml/100g.min. lower than adults
	- 6 months3years: 90ml/100g.min. higher than adults
	- 3-12 years: 100 ml/100g.min
- Autoregulation range is not known in infants and children, but is likely to be around 40-90 mmHg
## CMR
- In children, CMRO2 is higher at 5.2 ml 100g.min compared with 3.5 ml 100g.min in adults
- Their higher CBF and increased glucose usage is appropriate to this increased CMRO2
- Neonates have a lower CMRO2 (2.3 ml 100 g21 min21) and a lower CBF, with a relative tolerance of hypoxaemia
## Arterial Carbon dioxide/oxygen Tension (PaCO2/PaO2)
- **PaCO2**
	- Potent vasodilatory effect on cerebral blood vessels, leading to an increase in CBF, which is linear between a PaCO2 of 3.5 and 8 kPa
	- Moderate hypocapnia has less effect on the newborn brain than in adults and CBF changes relatively little until severe hypocapnia ensues.
- **Pa02:**
	- *Adults*: Cerebral vasculature is less sensitive to changes in PaO2; CBF does not increase until PaO2 decreases below 50 mmHg, and then it increases exponentially.
	- *In neonates:* CBF increases in response to smaller decreases in PaO2. Cerebral blood flow begins to rise when PaO2 falls to 6.7kPa (50mmHg), and doubles at PaO2 of 4kPa
## ICP
- Skull can increase in size
- Normal: 2–10 mmHg in children vs 8-18mmHg in adults
- **Closure of fontanelles**
	- Posterior: 6 months
	- Anterior: 12-18 months
	- Final cranial suture; up to 10 years
- *If acute injury then ICP will increase rapidly*
- **Temperature:**
	- For 1°C increase in body temperature, there is a 5% increase in cerebral metabolic rate leading to an increase in cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure

# Anaesthesia for Neurosurgery
## Considerations
- Limited airway access
- Need to treat ↑ ICP & optimize surgical exposure
- **Maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP):** Retractor pressure; Clipping/flow interruptions
- Neuromonitoring
- Smooth & crisp emergence for postoperative neurological assessment
- **Complications:** Venous air embolism; Haemorrhage; Arrhythmias & hemodynamic instability
## Goals
- **Cerebral protection:** Minimize ↑ ICP; Maintain CPP; Neuroprotection: temperature, barbiturates
- Minimize use of long acting sedatives to facilitate post-operative neurological evaluation
- Facilitate intraoperative neurological monitoring
## Anaesthetic Technique
- Propofol 2–3mg/kg combined with remifentanil (0.2–0.5 micrograms/kg/min)
- In the absence of remifentanil, use fentanyl 5 micrograms/kg at induction, followed by top-up doses, as required, or an alfentanil infusion (25–50 micrograms/kg/hr)
- Can use lidocaine 1.5mg/kg or a β-blocker (labetalol 5mg increments) to blunt response
- Give IV induction agents slowly to avoid reducing BP and CPP
- A non-depolarizing relaxant is used to facilitate intubation.
- Use an armoured ETT to prevent kinking, and secure in place with tapes, as ties may cause venous obstruction.
- Protect the eyes.
- Avoid N20 (leads to significant increases in CBF and CMRO2, increases the volume of gas-filled spaces, increasing the potential for raised ICP in pneumocephalus after operation)
- Maintain anaesthesia using either a volatile agent (sevoflurane/isoflurane <1 MAC) or TCI propofol (3–6 micrograms/mL). remifentanil infusion is continued at a lower rate (0.15–0.25 micrograms/ Procedure Excision or debulking of tumour, brain biopsy, drainage of cerebral abscess
- Aim for PaCO2 of 4.0–4.5kPa
- Avoid extreme neck flexion or rotation, which may impair cerebral venous return, and maintain a head-up tilt
- If the head is turned for surgery, support the shoulder to reduce the effect on neck veins
- Application of the Mayfield 3-point fixator to secure the head can cause a marked hypertensive response. Pin sites can be infiltrated with LA, and, if necessary, give a further dose of remifentanil (0.5–1 microgram/ kg) or propofol (0.5–1mg/kg)
## Awake Craniotomy

- Allows intraoperative assessment of the patient’s neurological status.
- Allow accurate mapping of the resection margins in epilepsy surgery, accurate location of electrodes in surgery for movement disorders, and excision of tumours from eloquent areas of the cortex (sensory, motor, speech areas)
- In tumour surgery, the aim is to achieve maximal tumour resection with minimal neurological deficit. It is used most effectively in combination with modern imaging techniques such as three-dimensional (3D) navigation systems
- Anticonvulsant prophylaxis and dexamethasone for those undergoing tumour surgery
- Antiemetic prophylaxis is administered routinely (e.g. ondansetron 4mg IV
- TCI of propofol and a remifentanil infusion (0.05–1 microgram/kg/min).
- Can use LMA
- When the tumour is exposed, the remifentanil is reduced to 0.005–0.01 microgram/kg/min to allow return of SV. When this occurs, the LMA is removed and the propofol stopped. Once the resection is complete, the patient is re-anaesthetized, and the LMA reinserted until the end of the procedure
## Management of Raised ICP

1. **Avoid increasing CBF** by avoiding hypercapnia, hypoxia, hypertension, hyper/hypoglycemia and hyperthermia.
2. Use IPPV to control PaCO2, and ensure good oxygenation, adequate analgesia, and anaesthetic depth
3. **Avoid increasing Venous Pressure.**
	- Avoid coughing and straining, the head-down position, and obstructing neck veins with ETT ties.
4. **Prevent further cerebral oedema.**
	- Ovid fluid overload. Restrict IV fluids to 30mL/kg/d if cerebral oedema present
	- Do not use hypotonic solutions—
	- Maintenance of a high normal plasma osmolality is essential.
5. **Maintain CPP:** 
	- CPP >60mmHg.
	- Avoid anaesthetic agents that increase ICP
6. **Specific measures to decrease intracranial pressure**
	- Mannitol 0.25–1g/kg over 15min or 5% saline (100mL) and furosemide 0.25–1mg/kg. Insert a urinary catheter in patients receiving diuretics.
	- Modest hyperventilation to PaCO 2 of 4.0–4.5kPa (30–34mmhg) Note: EtCO2 is lower than PaCO2.
	- Corticosteroids reduce oedema surrounding tumours and abscesses but have no role in head injury. they take several hours to work. Dexamethasone 4mg 6-hourly is often given electively preoperatively.
	- CSF may be drained via a ventricular or lumbar drain.
	- Position the patient with a head-up tilt of 30° to reduce CVP.
7. **Prevent seizures:**
	- Prophylactic or therapeutic phenytoin may be required (a loading dose of 15mg/kg, followed by a single daily dose of 3–4mg/kg)
8. **Monitoring:**
	- Arterial line/CVP, neuromuscular monitoring, and core temperature. Insert a urinary catheter

# Venous Air Embolism

- **Higher susceptibility:**
	- Head lies above the heart even when supine and constitutes a greater proportion of body surface area
	- Dural sinuses and diploic veins bridging the scalp and dura are held open by bony connections
	- Cardiac shunts are at risk of paradoxical air emboli and even small amounts of air are significant. End-tidal CO2 analysis and arterial catheterization (+precordial Doppler) detect VAE. Both traces will demonstrate an instantaneous decrease in their waveforms, as a result of the sudden decrease in cardiac output
- **Management**:
	- Surgeon should immediately occlude entry points and flood the surgical field with saline. Other manoeuvres include applying jugular venous compression, head-down tilt, and aspiration of air from the CVC. The mainstay of treatment is to provide cardiorespiratory support
# TBI
- The disproportionately larger and heavier head and weak neck muscles of children render them particularly prone to head injury after trauma
- Always consider non-accidental injury
- **Primary**
	- Occurs at the time of in initial injury, and may result in brain contusion, laceration, and haematoma formation or diffuse axonal injury.
	- Younger children: subdural haematomas and diffuse cerebral oedema without a skull fracture
	- Older children: skull fractures, contusions and extradural haematomas are more common
- **Secondary**
	- Minutes to days after the initial injury and may be due to hypotension, raised intracranial pressure or cerebral ischaemia.
	- Worsened by hypoxia, hypercarbia, anaemia, pyrexia, hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia

## Assessment
- Modified Glasgow Coma Scale for Children Rapid neurological assessment of patients with head injury may be made using the AVPU score (Alert, responds to Verbal commands, responds to Pain, Unresponsive)
![[Zotero Images/image-6-x139-y660.png]]
- **Pupil responses**
	- *Bilateral fixed and dilated pupils*–inadequate cerebral perfusion, possibly irreversible brain injury
	- *Bilateral pupil constriction*–early brain herniation through the foramen magnum, injury to the brainstem, side effect of opioids
	- *Unilateral fixed and dilated pupil*–herniation of the brain through the tentorium cerebelli within the skull on the same side, optic nerve injury
	- *Unilateral pupil constriction*–unilateral brainstem injury, Horner’s syndrome
- **The following features in the history and clinical condition indicate the possibility of a severe head injury**
	- History of a fall from a height, a high-speed road traffic accident, or road traffic accident where the child is a pedestrian or a cyclist
	- Loss or reduced level of consciousness
	- External sign of skull fracture, including base of skull fracture (‘panda eyes’, blood or CSF in the ear, bruising of the mastoid process behind the ear)
	- A Glasgow coma score of </= 8 or loss of ability to localise pain on the motor category
- **Indications for CT scan
	- A clinical suspicion of severe head injury, such as reduced conscious level, amnesia, abnormal drowsiness
	- Skull fracture, either basal or open or depressed skull fracture
	- Seizures, other neurological deficits or persistent vomiting
	- A dangerous mechanism of injury
	- Suspicion of non-accidental injury
## Considerations
- **Impaired autoregulation**
	- CPP should be maintained between 50-70 mmHg, that is, MAP 70-90 mmHg, assuming the intracranial pressure to be 20 mmHg.
	- Less than 50 mmHg has poor outcome
- **DIC**
	- Penetrating injury is associated with release of brain tissue into the circulation
- **Autonomic changes**:
	- Intense peripheral vasoconstriction and hypertension
- **Neurogenic pulmonary oedema**
- **Electrolytes abnormalities**
	- Cerebral salt wasting; Diabetes insipidus
	- Plasma sodium and plasma osmolality must be maintained within the high normal range (aim for plasma sodium 150 mmol/l in severe head injury
## Management

See ATLS and trauma notes

- **Indications for intubation
	- A Glasgow coma score of </= 8 or loss of ability to localise pain on the motor category
	- Inadequate breathing (saturation persistently <95% in oxygen), hyperventilation or hypoventilation (PaO2 <9kPa in air/<13kPa in oxygen or PaCO2 <3.5/>6kPa)
	- Loss of protective laryngeal reflexes
	- Significant facial or neck injuries
	- Seizures
- **CVS**
	- Expected systolic BP (mmHg) = 80 + (age in years x 2). Maintain CPP 50-70mmHg (MAP= 70-90)
	- Transfuse if HB less than 7g/dl
## Summary of Management
- Nurse the child in 30° head up position with neutral head positioning
- Maintain SpO2 >95%
- Maintain CO2 4.5-5.0 kPa
- Maintain blood pressure in the high/normal range
- Avoid excessive fluid loads
- Avoid hypotonic fluids containing dextrose.
- Aim for plasma sodium 145-150 mmol/l
- Use inotropes if necessary to maintain blood pressure (noradrenaline)
- Provide adequate sedation and analgesia
- Maintain blood sugar in normal range
- Maintain normal temperature, treat pyrexia aggressively
- Control seizures
- Provide adequate nutrition via a nasogastric tube (start early)
# VP Shunt

See [[HCP and VP shunt]]

- The normal range of ICP in neonates and infants is 06 mm Hg.
- Children with congenital hydrocephalus are likely to have extensive multisystem disorders, such as congenital heart disease or major spinal defects linked to premature birth.
- Children often present for repeated revision surgeries and may have other comorbidities, especially cerebral palsy and epilepsy.
- In neonates, the clinical signs of hydrocephalus include vomiting, irritability, drowsiness, downward gaze, bulging fontanelles, and an increased head circumference.
- An important sign of raised ICP in neonates is a propensity to apnoeic episodes
