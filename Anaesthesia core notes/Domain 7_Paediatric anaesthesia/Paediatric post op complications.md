# Postoperative Pain Management in Children (ESPA Guidance)

#### Overview

- **Guidance from the Pain Committee of the European Society for Paediatric Anaesthesiology (ESPA)**.
- Developed the **ESPA Pain Management Ladder** to ensure a basic standard of perioperative pain management for children, with suggestions for improvement.
- Addresses variations in pediatric anesthesia practices across Europe.
- **Primary aim**: Achieve at least the basic level of the Pain Management Ladder using widely available, safe, and proven drugs/methods.
- **Secondary goal**: Optimize pain management by climbing the pain ladder as resources allow.
#### Key Points

- Adequate pain therapy is not guaranteed; an estimated 80% of the global population lacks sufficient pain management.
- ESPA Pain Management Ladder is based on expert consensus for improving pediatric postoperative pain relief.
- Guidance is grouped by surgical procedure, with basic, intermediate, and advanced pain management options.
- Recognizes variations in resource availability and access to analgesic drugs across Europe.

- ESRA and ASRA joint practice advisory on safe regional anesthesia use in children is also recommended.
### Conclusions

- The ESPA Pain Management Ladder synthesizes existing guidelines, drug availability, costs, and safety concerns.
- The committee aims to improve pediatric postoperative pain management across Europe and globally.
# Emergence from Anesthesia Overview

- Process of returning to baseline physiological function after general anesthesia.
- Critical stage includes return to spontaneous breathing, voluntary swallowing, and normal consciousness.
### Factors Affecting Emergence

1. **Inhalational Agents**:
	- Influenced by alveolar ventilation, uptake/solubility, duration of anesthesia, concentration used.
2. **Intravenous Agents**:
	- Pharmacokinetics, duration of infusion, elimination, context-sensitive half-life.
### Common Emergence Issues

1. **Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)**
	- Most common complication in the immediate postoperative period.
	- Can cause delayed discharge, unplanned admissions, and poor patient satisfaction.
	
	**Risk Assessment Tools**:
	- Apfel scoring system and other tools to predict risk.
	
	**PONV Prophylaxis**:
	- **Low Risk**: No prophylaxis unless surgical indications.
	- **Moderate Risk**: Single prophylactic agent.
	- **High Risk**: 2-3 agents, avoid opioids and volatile agents.
	
	**Drug Classes**:
	- **Serotonin-receptor antagonists (5-HT3)**: Ondansetron, dolasetron, granisetron.
	- **Glucocorticoids**: Dexamethasone (4 mg at induction).
	- **Anticholinergics**: Scopolamine patch (slow onset).
	- **Neurokinin-receptor antagonist**: Aprepitant (limited use due to cost).
2. **Respiratory Complications**
	- Second most common postoperative complication.
	- 3 times more common after extubation than during intubation.
	
	**Causes**:
	- **Airway obstruction**: Pharyngeal muscle weakness, laryngospasm, vocal cord paralysis, airway edema, postoperative cervical hematoma, foreign bodies.
	
	**Pharyngeal Muscle Weakness**:
	- Due to residual neuromuscular blockade, anesthetic effects, opioids.
	- Treatment: Jaw thrust and CPAP.
	
	**Laryngospasm**:
	- More common in pediatric patients; managed with 100% oxygen, jaw thrust, CPAP, and possibly succinylcholine.
	
	**Vocal Cord Paralysis**:
	- Unilateral causes hoarseness; bilateral resembles laryngospasm.
	
	**Postoperative Cervical Hematoma**:
	- Rapid tracheal narrowing; requires surgical evacuation.
3. **Cardiovascular Complications**
	- Common complications include hypertension, hypotension, and arrhythmias.
	- Related to comorbidities like CAD and blood loss.
4. **Emergence Delirium (ED)**
	- Dissociated consciousness; irritability, inconsolable crying, thrashing.
	- Incidence: 2-80%, depending on rating systems and surgical procedures.
	
	**Risk Factors**:
	- Rapid emergence, volatile anesthetics, postoperative pain, ENT surgery, age 1-5 years, preoperative anxiety.

### Scales for Evaluation of Severity and Incidence of Emergence Delirium (ED)
#### 1. Cravero Scale

The Cravero scale, though validated, is noted for its complexity due to numerous variables and a detailed grading system. It is considered challenging to use in clinical settings. The scale defines a score of ≥ 4 for 5 minutes or more, despite calming efforts, as indicative of ED.

##### Cravero Scale Scoring
- **1:** Obtunded with no response to stimulation
- **2:** Asleep but responsive to movement or stimulation
- **3:** Awake and responsive
- **4:** Crying for more than 3 minutes
- **5:** Thrashing behavior that requires restraint
#### 2. Watcha Scale

The Watcha scale offers fewer variables and is thus easier to utilize. It defines ED at the severity level of 3-4.

##### Watcha Scale Scoring
- **0:** Asleep
- **1:** Calm
- **2:** Crying but can be consoled
- **3:** Crying but cannot be consoled
- **4:** Agitated and thrashing around
#### 3. PAED Scale

The PAED (Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium) scale, while validated, is noted for its practical challenges in clinical use. A score of >10 on this scale correlates with a sensitivity of 86% for the detection of ED. The scale's simplicity allows for a more straightforward evaluation of severity.

### PAED Scale Scoring Table

| Behavior              | 0          | 1          | 2           | 3          | 4          |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Makes eye contact     | Extremely  | Very much  | Quite a bit | Just a bit | Not at all |
| Purposeful actions    | Extremely  | Very much  | Quite a bit | Just a bit | Not at all |
| Aware of surroundings | Extremely  | Very much  | Quite a bit | Just a bit | Not at all |
| Restlessness          | Not at all | Just a bit | Quite a bit | Very much  | Extremely  |
| Inconsolable          | Not at all | Just a bit | Quite a bit | Very much  | Extremely  |

**Preventative Strategies**:
- Premedication with midazolam or ketamine.
- Use of analgesics and sedatives (fentanyl, propofol, α2-agonists).
- Parental presence at induction.

	**Treatment**:
	- Fentanyl, propofol, reuniting with parents for reassurance.
	- ![[Emergence Delirium copy.docx.pdf]]
5. **Delayed Emergence**
	- Failure to regain consciousness 30-60 minutes after anesthesia.

#### Causes of Delayed Emergence
1. **Residual Anesthetic Drugs**:
	- **Opioids**: Respiratory depression and sedation via opioid receptors.
	- **Benzodiazepines**: Respiratory depression, especially when combined with opioids.
	- **Neuromuscular Blockers**: Can cause delayed emergence, compounded by:
		- Drug interactions (e.g., with calcium channel blockers).
		- Acidosis.
		- Hypomagnesemia.
2. **Metabolic Effects and Electrolyte Abnormalities**:
	- **Hypoglycemia**: Causes confusion, irritability, seizures, and coma.
	- **Hyperglycemia**: May contribute to delayed emergence.
	- **Hyponatremia**:
		- **<120 mmol/L**: Causes confusion and irritability.
		- **<110 mmol/L**: Can lead to seizures and coma.
	- **Hypernatremia**: Causes dehydration, ruptured blood vessels, and coma.
3. **Respiratory Failure**:
	- **Hypercapnia**: Initially stimulates the respiratory center but later depresses respiration, causing hypoventilation and apnea.
	- **Hypoxia**: Causes cerebral hypoxia, leading to depressed cerebral function and eventual cell death.
4. **Hypothermia**:
	- Causes widespread effects including neurological and respiratory depression.
	- Hypothermia also slows drug metabolism, compounding its effects on delayed emergence.
5. **Neurological Causes**:
	- **Hemorrhage**, **thrombus**, and **emboli**.
	- **Hypotension** and **hypoperfusion** of the brain.
	- **Hypoxia** causing cerebral damage.
### Stepwise Approach to the Patient with Prolonged Unconsciousness
#### Initial Assessment and Immediate Actions

1. **Rapid assessment of ABC:**
   - Administer 100% oxygen, ensure airway adjuncts are in place, and commence manual ventilation if necessary.
2. **Assess Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS); Stimulate the patient:**
   - Evaluate responsiveness using the GCS and attempt gentle stimulation to assess level of consciousness.
#### Diagnostic and Review Steps

3. **Review anesthetic chart:**
   - Check drugs administered, timing, interactions, and consider patient-specific factors that could influence recovery.
4. **Capillary blood glucose:**
   - Perform a quick glucose test to identify hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia and correct accordingly.
5. **Measure temperature:**
   - Check if the temperature is below 35.5°C and warm the patient if necessary.
6. **Arterial blood gas analysis:**
   - Analyze for hypoxia, acidosis, and hypercapnia, and correct these as needed.
#### Further Examination and Testing

7. **Full clinical exam with a focus on respiratory and nervous systems:**
   - Examine for focal and lateralizing signs which might indicate specific neurological issues.
8. **Blood tests - FBC, U&E, TFT, and glucose:**
   - Complete a full blood count, urea & electrolytes, thyroid function tests, and reassess glucose levels.
#### Consideration of Reversal Agents

9. **Consider administration of reversal agents:**
   - Depending on the anesthetics used, consider naloxone, flumazenil, neostigmine, and doxapram as potential reversal agents.
#### Advanced Diagnostic Imaging
10. **Consider further diagnostic tests:**
	- If initial assessments do not resolve the unconscious state, consider an X-ray of the chest and a CT scan of the head.
#### Decision Making for Unresolved Cases
11. **Decision on further management:**
	- If the patient remains unconscious, decide on the next steps for management and potential transfer to a specialized unit.

1. **Hypothermia**
	- Decrease in body temperature by 2°C slows drug metabolism and decreases platelet function.
	- Large number of patients become hypothermic in the recovery room.
	- Shivering treated with pethidine or α2-agonists.
### Systematic Approach to Emergence and Extubation

1. Ensure a **stable, patent airway**.
2. Assess **adequate ventilation and oxygenation**.
3. Confirm **hemodynamic stability** before moving patients.

		- Unexplained hemodynamic instability
#### Outcome Decision
- **The patient requires continued intubation and mechanical ventilation if:**
	- Any of the 'No' criteria from the immediate post-surgical extubation checklist are met, indicating potential risks if extubation is attempted.
# Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) in Pediatric Anesthesia
## Incidence and Significance
- PONV is a common complication in pediatric anesthesia.
- Incidence ranges from **33.2% to 82%**, which is **twice as high** compared to adults.
- High incidence justifies the use of **antiemetic prophylaxis** rather than only therapy.
## Risk Factors for PONV in Children
- Previous PONV or positive family history.
- Duration of anesthesia > 30 minutes.
- Age ≥ 3 years.
- Strabismus surgery.
- Risk of PONV is **9%, 10%, 30%, 55%, and 70%** with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 risk factors, respectively.
- Excluding strabismus, the incidence of PONV is **11.6% with 1 risk factor**, **28.2% with 2 risk factors**, and **up to 42.3% with 3 risk factors**.
## Postdischarge Nausea and Vomiting (PDNV)
- **PDNV**: Nausea and vomiting occurring up to 7 days after discharge.
- In adults, PDNV risk is **10-80%** depending on risk factors.
- In children, incidence depends on the type of surgery:
	- **20%** of tonsillectomy patients experience PDNV on day 3.
	- **8%** experience PDNV on day 7.
	- Treatment with ondansetron disintegrating tablets reduces PDNV from **32% to 14.5%**.
## Specific Emetic Surgical Procedures in Children
- **Strabismus surgery**: PONV incidence of **54%**.
- **ENT surgery (e.g., tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy)**: PONV incidence of **82%**.
	- Even with prophylaxis, the incidence is **36%** and **33%**, respectively.
- **Appendectomy**: **42% nausea**, **19.9% PONV**.
- **Small pediatric surgeries**: **42.9% nausea**, **28.6% PONV**.
- **Outpatients** have lower PONV risk (**10-29%**) than inpatients (**10-50%**), with the length of the procedure being a key influencing factor.
## General Antiemetic Strategies During Anesthesia
1. **Avoidance of volatile anesthetics** and preference for **total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA)** with propofol.
2. **Use of regional anesthesia** or **combined general and regional anesthesia** to reduce postoperative opioid use.
3. **Multimodal postoperative pain therapy** to reduce opioid use.
4. **Avoidance of nitrous oxide**.
5. **Adequate hydration**:
	- High-dose IV fluids (**30 ml/kg/h**) are associated with less emesis compared to standard therapy (**10 ml/kg/h**).
## Antiemetic Drugs
### Dexamethasone
- Effective for PONV prophylaxis in adults at doses of **4-5 mg**.
- In children, there is no consensus on the dose-response relationship.
- **0.15 mg/kg (max 4-5 mg)** is as effective as **0.5 mg/kg**, reducing PONV incidence from **49% to 21-22%**.
- **Potential side effects**:
	- Tumor lysis syndrome with electrolyte disturbances.
	- Increased bleeding risk after tonsillectomy (although this effect disappears when excluding primary hemorrhage cases).
	- Increased blood glucose levels.
### 5-HT3 Antagonists (e.g., Ondansetron, Granisetron, Ramosetron)
- **Ondansetron**: **0.1-0.15 mg/kg IV** is effective for PONV prophylaxis.
- **Ramosetron**: More effective than ondansetron, particularly for late PONV (6-24 hours).
- **Potential side effects**:
	- **QT interval prolongation**, but no reports of arrhythmias at therapeutic doses.
### Dimenhydrinate
- Antihistamine with antiemetic effects.
- May have efficacy similar to 5-HT3 antagonists, dexamethasone, and droperidol.
- Causes more sedation and requires longer PACU observation.
### Droperidol
- Dopamine antagonist with antiemetic effects.
- Recommended as **rescue medication** due to potential side effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, and QT prolongation.
- Low doses (**10 μg/kg up to 1.25 mg**) may be sufficient without significant side effects.
### Metoclopramide
- Dopamine antagonist with antiemetic properties.
- Less effective than ondansetron (**0.15 mg/kg**) for PONV prophylaxis in tonsillectomy.
- Should not be used routinely as a prophylactic drug.
## Multimodal Prophylaxis
- Combination of drugs from different substance classes is more effective than monotherapy.
- **Preferred combinations**:
	- 5-HT3 antagonist + dexamethasone.
	- 5-HT3 antagonist + droperidol (less preferred due to FDA warnings).
	- Dexamethasone + droperidol (less preferred due to FDA warnings).
### Recommendations for PONV Prophylaxis in Children ≥ 3 Years
1. **Outpatients**:
	- Small procedures: Single prophylaxis.
	- High-risk cases (strabismus, ENT, other risk factors): Double prophylaxis.
2. **Inpatients**:
	- Longer procedures (>30 min) or frequent opioid use: Double prophylaxis.
	- High-risk cases (strabismus, ENT, other risk factors): Triple prophylaxis.
3. **Rescue Therapy**:
	- Dimenhydrinate.
	- Droperidol.
	- Metoclopramide.
