# Acute Stridor in Children
#### Definition
- **Stridor**: Harsh, vibratory sound due to partial airway obstruction resulting in turbulent airflow, indicating underlying pathology and potential life-threatening airway obstruction.
#### Anatomy and Physiology
- Infants and young children have small upper and lower airways prone to occlusion and oedema.
- **Poiseuille’s Law**: Small decrease in airway radius leads to significant increase in resistance to airflow. Resistance to laminar airflow increases inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius.
- **Support Structures**: Less developed and more compliant airway support compared to adults.
- **Ribs**: Cartilaginous and perpendicular to the vertebral column, reducing rib cage movement efficiency (bucket handle effect)
- **Respiratory Muscles**: Immature intercostal and accessory muscles, with children relying more on the diaphragm.
- **Respiratory Effort**: Increased effort leads to subcostal and sternal recession, reducing chest wall efficiency.
- **Metabolic Rate and Oxygen Demand**: Higher in children, leading to rapid deterioration with airway compromise.
- **Functional Residual Capacity**: Smaller, with fewer fatigue-resistant diaphragm fibers, resulting in little respiratory reserve during stress.
#### Assessment
- **Minimal Disturbance**: Stridulous, distressed child should be disturbed as little as possible; crying and agitation increase respiratory effort and risk of airway obstruction.
- **Posture**: Allow child to adopt comfortable posture; parents should be present.
- **Avoid Examination and Cannulation**: Throat examination and i.v. cannulation should be avoided.
- **Stridor Phase**: Indicates level of airway compromise:
		- **Inspiratory Stridor**
			- **Level of Obstruction**: Above the cords (extrathoracic)
			- **Examples**: Croup, epiglottitis
		- **Expiratory Stridor**
			- **Level of Obstruction**: Below the cords (intrathoracic)
			- **Examples**: Foreign body
		- **Biphasic Stridor**
			- **Level of Obstruction**: At or below the cords (intra or extrathoracic)
			- **Examples**: Foreign body, bacterial tracheitis
- **Volume of Stridor**: Does not correlate with degree of obstruction; decreasing volume may indicate decreasing conscious level.
- **Signs of Increased Work of Breathing**: Examination may be limited to inspection and possible gentle chest examination, so it's important to look for signs of increased work of breathing:
	- Ventilatory Frequency
		- **Infant**: >50 bpm
		- **Child**: >30 bpm
	- Effort
		- **Infant**: Head bobbing; nasal flaring
		- **Child**: 'See-saw' chest and abdomen; recession: subcostal, sternal, intercostal, tracheal tug; nasal flaring
	- Posture
		- **Infant**: Arching backwards
		- **Child**: Tripod position
	- Noise
		- Infants grunt to generate auto-CPAP
		- Wheezing can occur with an inhaled foreign body
		- Stridor
	- Ineffective Breathing
		- Hypoxaemia and hypercarbia produce:
			- Tachycardia
			- Sweating
			- Restlessness and confusion
			- Agitation and anxiety
			- Pallor or mottling
	- Impending Respiratory Arrest
		- Decreased conscious level
		- Slowing ventilatory frequency
		- Episodes of apnoea
		- Silent chest despite vigorous respiratory effort
		- Bradycardia
- **Pulse Oximeter**: Usually well tolerated.
- **Laboratory Tests**: Not helpful in early assessment.
- **Radiology**: Useful in less acute cases, performed at bedside with minimal disturbance.
- **Severe Airway Obstruction**: Requires urgent airway examination under anaesthesia, with collaboration from an experienced ENT surgeon.
### Viral Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis) in Children

#### Incidence and Causes
- Responsible for >80% of acute stridor cases in children.
- Typically caused by parainfluenza viruses.
- Can also be caused by influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus, or rhinovirus.
- Commonly affects children aged 6 months to 3 years, peak at 2 years.
- Only 2% of cases are hospitalized annually, with 0.5–1.5% requiring intubation.
#### Pathophysiology
- Infection results in subglottic and tracheal swelling causing stridor and respiratory obstruction.
- Severe cases also affect small airways, leading to bronchial constriction, oedema, and atelectasis.
- Develops 2-3 days into an upper respiratory tract infection.
- Characterized by barking cough, low-grade fever, inspiratory stridor, increased respiratory effort, fatigue, hypoxia, and hypercarbia.
#### Assessment and Monitoring
- Use a scoring system for croup to assess severity:
![[A8BD5227-D7E6-4257-9FE1-0A6EC0875C30.jpeg]]

- Serial bedside assessment is crucial to determine treatment success and need for further interventions.
- Possible need for admission to a high dependency unit or tracheal intubation.
#### Treatment
1. **Humidification of Respiratory Gases and Oxygen**:
	- Administer humidified respiratory gases.
	- Provide oxygen as needed.
2. **Steroids**:
	- Reduce symptoms and improve croup scores 6-24 hours post-dosing.
	- Parenteral dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg), oral dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg), and nebulized budesonide (2 mg) have similar efficacy.
	- Oral dexamethasone preferred for less distress and quicker administration.
3. **Nebulized Epinephrine**:
	- Reduces oedema via alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction.
	- Racemic epinephrine (0.5 ml of 2.25% solution diluted to 4 ml) in North America; L-epinephrine (1/1000, 0.5 ml/kg to a max of 5 ml) in the UK.
	- Repeated administration may be necessary, with ECG monitoring recommended.
4. **Heliox (70:30% Helium-Oxygen Mixture)**:
	- Facilitates laminar airflow in narrowed airways.
	- Similar improvements in croup score as nebulized epinephrine.
	- Limiting oxygen to 30% could be a disadvantage in severe bronchial involvement.
#### Indications for Tracheal Intubation
- Persistent high croup score despite treatment (e.g., score ≥7).
- Preparation for intubation involves escort to theatre by an anaesthetist and oxygen via mask if required.
- Use sevoflurane for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia.
- Maintain spontaneous ventilation with CPAP.
- Establish i.v. access post-loss of consciousness
- Use a smaller tracheal tube due to subglottic oedema.
- Prefer oral intubation initially, switching to nasal tube once stable.
#### Post-Intubation Management
- I.V. sedation (e.g., midazolam 2–8 ug/kg/min, morphine 20–40 ug/kg/h) in PICU.
- Continue with CPAP, humidified air-oxygen, and i.v. fluids.
- Consider arm splinting to prevent self-extubation.
- Use IPPV and frequent suctioning for extensive small airway involvement.
- Reserve antibiotics for bacterial infections.
- Attempt extubation when a leak develops around the tracheal tube, which can take 2-10 days.
### Postintubation Croup

- **Cause**: Subglottic oedema often due to an unduly large tracheal tube.
- **Symptoms**: Stridor and respiratory obstruction within 30 min of extubation.
- **Treatment**: Nebulized epinephrine and i.v. dexamethasone.
- **Observation**:
	- Day case patients should be observed for at least 2 hours before discharge.
	- Persistent or recurrent airway obstruction warrants hospital admission.
### Epiglottitis

- **Cause**: Bacterial infection of the epiglottis, aryepiglottis, and arytenoids.
	- Common bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), beta-haemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, pneumococci.
	- Hib vaccine introduced in 1992, leading to a decrease in childhood epiglottitis.
	- Resurgence of Hib infections observed, but numbers are smaller than pre-vaccine era.
	- 10% of children with epiglottitis had Hib infection despite vaccination.
- **Clinical Presentation**:
	- Abrupt onset of high fever, sore throat, dysphagia, stridor, and drooling.
	- Muffled or lost speech, absence of spontaneous cough.
	- Toxic appearance, preference to sit leaning forward with mouth open, tongue and jaw protruding.
	- Rapid progression with accessory muscle use, cyanosis, and altered consciousness indicating severe respiratory compromise.
- **Differentiation from Croup**:
	- Epiglottitis: Fulminant onset, toxic appearance, unrelieved by nebulized epinephrine.
	- Croup: Typically viral, relieved by nebulized epinephrine.
- **Management Protocol**:
	- Secure airway under inhalation anaesthesia with ENT surgeon standby for potential bronchoscopy or tracheostomy.
	- Induce anaesthesia in sitting position, attempt i.v. cannulation once child is sufficiently obtunded.
	- Laryngoscopy reveals red, swollen epiglottis and inflamed supraglottic tissues.
	- Use tracheal tube 0.5–1.0 mm (ID) smaller than normal for child's age; stiffen tube with stylet or refrigeration.
	- Direct oral tracheal tube to visualized glottic opening or bubbles; replace with nasal tube once fully oxygenated.
- **Post-Intubation Care**:
	- Obtain laryngeal and blood cultures during anaesthesia.
	- Commence antibiotics with extended spectrum cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone 80 mg/kg/day, max 4 g/day).
	- Indicators of recovery: Normal body temperature return and increased leak around tracheal tube.
	- Extubation: Perform direct examination under anaesthesia with propofol, confirm normal epiglottis, and extubate when fully awake.
### Bacterial Tracheitis

- **Incidence**: Uncommon, but may have overtaken epiglottitis post-Hib vaccine.
- **Pathogens**: Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, streptococci, Neisseria species.
- **Symptoms**:
	- Intermediate between viral croup and epiglottitis.
	- Rapid illness onset (8-10 hours) after 2-3 days of upper respiratory tract infection.
	- High fever, respiratory distress, copious tracheal secretions, retrosternal pain, hoarse voice, prominent stridor.
	- No dysphagia or drooling; patient can lie flat.
	- Acute obstruction with purulent debris and pseudomembranes over friable tracheal mucosa.
- **Treatment**:
	- Tracheal intubation required; follow epiglottitis protocol.
	- At laryngoscopy, normal epiglottis and supraglottic structures, but slough and pus beyond vocal cords.
	- Perform bronchoscopy to remove debris before intubation.
	- Suction remaining purulent material post-intubation.
	- Tracheal intubation before anaesthesia and bronchoscopy if child is in extremis.
	- Blood and tracheal aspirate samples for culture and sensitivity tests.
	- Antibiotics: Ceftriaxone first-line; consider vancomycin for MRSA.
	- PICU management: Sedation, IPPV/CPAP, frequent suctioning, fluid resuscitation.
	- Duration: Tracheal intubation (6-7 days), antibiotic therapy, and hospitalization (up to 14 days).
	- Complication: Tracheal stenosis.
### Retropharyngeal or Tonsillar Abscess

- **Cause**: Lymphatic spread of infection from sinuses, teeth, or middle ear.
- **Common Agents**: Staphylococci, streptococci.
- **Symptoms**:
	- Neck swelling, pain, fever, drooling, dysphagia, trismus, limited neck movement.
	- Inspiratory stridor from pharyngeal oedema.
- **Diagnosis**: Clinical, confirmed by lateral soft tissue neck film for retropharyngeal thickening.
- **Treatment**:
	- Surgery to avoid abscess rupture and aspiration.
	- Extubation post-procedure.
	- Subsequent i.v. hydration and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
### Foreign Body Aspiration

- **Incidence**: Peak at 1–2 years of age.
- **Symptoms**:
	- Sudden coughing, gagging, choking.
	- Complete obstruction (above vocal cords): Upper airway stridor, voice change or loss.
	- Partial obstruction (lower airway): Air trapping, pneumothorax, surgical emphysema, pneumomediastinum.
	- Examination: Possible lobe/lung collapse, bronchial breathing, inspiratory crackles, expiratory wheeze.
	- May mimic refractory asthma.
- **Diagnosis and Treatment**:
	- Rigid bronchoscopy under deep inhalation anaesthesia with topical lidocaine (up to 3 mg/kg).
	- Dexamethasone and nebulized epinephrine to reduce airway oedema post-bronchoscopy.
	- Urgency based on severity of symptoms and degree of obstruction.

# Upper Respiratory Tract Infection and Paediatric Anaesthesia

### Introduction

- **Prevalence**:
	- Most common reason for pediatric emergency/outpatient visits in the US.
	- Adults: 2-4 URTIs/year; children: 6-8 URTIs/year.
- **Etiology**:
	- Caused by approximately 200 viruses.
	- Symptoms: cough, nasal congestion and discharge, sore throat, sneezing.
	- 95% are viral; rhinoviruses account for 30-40% of infections.
- **Clinical Implications**:
	- Airway hyper-reactivity common post-URTI, significant in anaesthesia.
### Pathophysiology of Airway Hyper-reactivity
- **Mechanisms**:
	- **Inflammatory mediators**: Bradykinin, prostaglandin, histamine, interleukin.
	- **Neurologic reflexes**: Inhibition of muscarinic M2 receptors by viral neuraminidases, increasing acetylcholine release, leading to bronchoconstriction.
	- **Vagal Component**: Atropine blocks hyper-reactivity, supporting vagal involvement.
	- **Tachykinins**: Inhibited endopeptidase activity during viral infections increases smooth muscle contraction.
### Differential Diagnosis of URTI
- **Infectious**:
	- Croup
	- Influenza
	- Epiglottitis
	- Streptococcal sore throat
	- Herpes simplex
	- Bronchiolitis
	- Pneumonia
- **Non-infectious**:
	- Allergic or vasomotor rhinitis
	- Asthma
	- Foreign body aspiration
	- Gastro-oesophageal reflux
### Risk Factors for Perioperative Adverse Respiratory Events
- **Increased Risk**:
	- History of URTI or respiratory disease.
	- Greatest risk with acute infection; increased risk persists for 2-6 weeks post-URTI.
	- Airway reactivity elevated for 6-8 weeks following URTI.
	- Higher complications in major surgery, especially infective ones.
	- Most adverse events are manageable with no lasting effects.
- **Adverse Respiratory Events**:
	- Coughing
	- Breath holding
	- Laryngospasm
	- Bronchospasm
	- Airway obstruction
	- Oxygen desaturation (<90% for ≥10 seconds)
	- Atelectasis
	- Post-extubation stridor
	- Pneumonia
	- Unanticipated tracheal intubation or re-intubation
### Incidence and Risk Factors
- **Studies**: Large cohort studies (Tait et al, Parnis et al, von Ungern Sternberg et al) show:
	- Children with active/recent URTI (within 2-4 weeks) have higher episodes of breath holding, oxygen desaturation, severe coughing.
- **Independent Risk Factors**:
	- Intubation
	- Prematurity (<37 weeks)
	- History of asthma or atopy
	- Family members who smoke
	- Airway surgery
	- Presence of copious secretions
	- Nasal congestion
	- Parental confirmation of cold
	- Snoring
### Anesthesia and Complications

- **Induction Agents**:
	- Inhalation agents (sevoflurane, halothane): More respiratory complications compared to propofol.
	- Thiopentone: Highest risk of respiratory complications.
- **Anaesthetist Experience**: Fewer airway complications with more experienced anaesthetists.
- **Neuromuscular Blocking Agents**: Higher respiratory complications if not reversed.
### Preoperative Assessment
- **Categorization**:
	- Mild URTI: Clear rhinorrhea, healthy appearance, clear lungs, no fever.
	- Severe symptoms: Fever >38°C, purulent nasal discharge, productive cough, ill-appearing with pulmonary signs.
- **Anaesthesia**:
	- Mild URTI: Safe to anaesthetize.
	- Severe symptoms: Postpone elective surgeries for at least 4 weeks.
	- Perioperative adverse respiratory events are recognizable and treatable.
- **Laboratory Tests**:
	- Rarely necessary; chest X-ray for lower respiratory involvement.
	- Oxygen saturation measurement useful for detecting lower respiratory infection.
### Should Surgery Be Postponed in Any Child with URTI?
- **Considerations**:
	- Blanket cancellation is conservative but impractical.
	- Decision based on child’s age, symptoms, procedure urgency/type, comorbidities.
	- Higher respiratory complication risk in children <1 year.
	- Frequency of URTI episodes in child considered for scheduling elective surgery.
- **Individual Assessment**:
	- Proceed if child appears healthy, only clear rhinorrhea, no ETT or airway surgery.
	- Postpone if purulent discharge, productive cough, fever, signs of lower respiratory involvement (desaturation, wheeze).
	- Low threshold for cancellation in major elective surgery.
	- Final decision by anaesthetist after consulting surgeon and parents.
### Anaesthetic Management
- **Goals**: Minimize secretions, avoid or limit airway stimulation.
- **Airway Management**:
	- Suction only under deep anaesthesia.
	- Ensure hydration, use humidifier to clear secretions.
- **Medications**:
	- Anticholinergics (atropine, glycopyrrolate): Limited benefit.
	- Preoperative bronchodilators: Reduce bronchoconstriction, perioperative respiratory events. Combination of ß2 agonist (salbutamol) and inhaled corticosteroids more effective.
- **Intubation**:
	- Avoid tracheal intubation if possible, especially in children <5 years.
	- Prefer LMA or facemask; lubricate LMA with lignocaine gel.
- **Induction Agents**:
	- Propofol: Fewer adverse respiratory events compared to sevoflurane.
	- Maintenance: Use intravenous or inhalation techniques with deep anaesthesia. Sevoflurane for both induction and maintenance preferred over sevoflurane induction with isoflurane maintenance.
- **Extubation**:
	- No consensus on optimal depth of anaesthesia for extubation.
	- Options: Awake extubation (clear secretions, protect airway) vs. deep anaesthesia extubation (avoid reflex airway constriction).
	- Study: No difference in complications whether ETT removed awake or under deep anaesthesia in children with URTI.
### Conclusion
- Children with active/recent URTI (within 4 weeks) have increased perioperative respiratory complication risk.
- Awareness of risk factors helps anaesthetist decide whether to proceed and optimize anaesthetic management.
- Informed consent, clinical judgment, and experience are crucial in decision-making.
