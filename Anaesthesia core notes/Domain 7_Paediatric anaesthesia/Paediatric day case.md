# Facility
- Specifically designed paediatric day case units where specialized equipment and paediatric trained multidisciplinary teams are available from admission until discharge
- Preoperative assessment services must be in place and can be used to risk stratify patients who may require further assessment and optimization prior to undergoing their procedure
- 24-hour telephone accessibility and by provision of robust verbal and written postoperative information and instructions.
# Inclusion and Exclusions
- Term babies are appropriate candidates for day surgery once they reach 44 weeks post conception age (PCA)
- Ex-premature infants are at high risk of developing apnoeas after anaesthesia regardless of whether a regional or general anaesthetic is used.6 Sole regional anaesthesia seems to decrease the risk of apnoeas in the first 30 minutes postoperatively but not in the longer term period (>12 hours), which is critical for day case surgeries.
## Inclusion Categories for Day Case Surgery
### Non-medical Considerations
- **Consent**: Agreement to day surgery by patient and/or parents.
- **Care**: Parents are able to accompany and look after the child on discharge.
- **Communication**: Parents can access 24-hour help from the hospital via phone.
- **Closeness**: Patients reside within an hour of the hospital.
### Medical Factors
- **Health Conditions**: Child is either healthy, has mild systemic disease, or stable chronic disease, confirmed by a robust preoperative assessment service.
- **Surgical Procedures**: Surgery must be included in the BADS (British Association of Day Surgery) directory of day case procedures.
- **Age and Obesity Considerations**: Specific protocols should be in place, with mandatory preoperative assessments for all patients.
### Management of Ex-Premature Infants for Minor Surgery

- **Age Consideration**: Between 50-56 weeks post-conceptional age (PCA).
- **Health Screening**: Checks for anemia, ongoing apneas, neurological disease, or gestational age of <32 weeks.
- **Team Approval**: Day-case care considered if both senior anaesthetist and surgeon agree.
- **Postoperative Care**: Discharge only after uneventful 6-hour observation, confirmed by a senior surgical team member.
# Advantages and Disadvantages of Paediatric Day Case Surgery
#### Advantages
- Reduces risk of nosocomial infections, anxiety, school absence, and disruption to work and childcare.
- Increases efficiency and cost-effectiveness of service.
#### Disadvantages
- Difficulties in managing pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, condition deterioration, and surgical complications after discharge.
# Perioperative Management
## Pre Operative
- Nurse-led preoperative assessment services with consultant support are an extremely effective way to prevent unnecessary day of admission cancellations
- Screening questionnaires are completed online or via telephone. This process identifies patients who are suitable for day surgery. Those who require further investigation, optimization or anaesthetic consultant review are also identified
- Pregnancy screening: should be considered in all female patients aged 12 and over
- DVT prophylaxis: most children undergoing surgery do not require thromboprophylaxis
## Vaccination Considerations
- Continue with normal vaccination schedules, in line with the following recommendations
- Following immunization with inactivated vaccines delay surgery 48 hours post vaccination to avoid postvaccination symptoms causing diagnostic concerns perioperatively.
- Following immunization with live attenuated vaccines proceed with surgery if the child is well
# Anaesthesia
## Priorities

Four As: alertness, ambulation, analgesia and alimentation, otherwise the resulting failure can lead to the unwanted A of admission (unplanned)

## Fasting
- 6 hours for food
- 4 hours for breast milk
- 1 hour for clear fluids (this should not exceed a volume of 3 mL/kg)
## Pre Med
- EMLA patch
- Good psychological preparation and parental presence at induction increases cooperation
- Midazolam is commonly used. If given orally at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (maximum of 20 mg)
- Clonidine at 4 mg/kg which has a longer onset time of 45 minutes
- Dexmedetomidine at 2mg/kg
## Induction and Maintenance
- Propofol may be associated with a significant reduction in perioperative respiratory events when compared with sevoflurane
## Analgesia
- Multimodal techniques of simple analgesics with local anaesthesia adjuncts
### Intravenous Paracetamol Dosing Regime
- **Preterm Neonate (>32 weeks PCA)**: Maintenance dose of 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours, with a daily limit of 25 mg/kg.
- **Term Neonate**: Maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg every 4-6 hours, daily limit of 30 mg/kg.
- **Children <10 kg Body Weight**: Same as term neonate dosing.
- **Children 10-50 kg**: Maintenance dose of 15 mg/kg every 4-6 hours, daily limit of 60 mg/kg.
- **Adults >50 kg**: Maintenance dose of 1 g every 4-6 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 4g.
- NSAIDS for over 3 months
- Codeine is no longer being used in children below 12 years of age and not in any child under 18 years with OSA undergoing adeno-tonsillectomy
- Intraoperative use of opioids are tailored to avoid the inevitable consequences of respiratory depression, sedation and PONV. The rate of PONV increases even after one dose of morphine in children. When opioids are used preference is given to shorter acting opioids such as fentanyl (1-2 mg/kg)
- Oral morphine can be used to good effect and current hospital dosing schedules are of the order of 200 mg/kg every 4 hours according to response
- Regional anaesthesia
### Factors Affecting Paediatric Pain Control at Home
#### Child Factors
- Issues with taking medication or timing (e.g., sleeping during scheduled times).
#### Parental Factors
- Difficulties in pain assessment, lack of knowledge, cultural expectations.
#### Medication
- Issues with formulations (tablets vs. suspension), taste, effectiveness.
#### Hospital System
- Inadequate discharge information, restricted access to stronger analgesics without prescriptions.
## PONV
- PONV is a leading cause of unplanned hospital admission postoperatively and is twice as likely in paediatrics than in the adult population
### Risk Factors Include
- Patient factors: age >3 years, motion sickness, previous history of PONV, female
- Surgical factors: duration of GA >30 minutes, strabismus surgery, adenotonsillectomy
- Anaesthetic factors: use of volatile anaesthetic agents, use of opioids, use of anticholinesterases
### Prophylaxis
- Ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (0.15mg/kg)
- Droperidol (0.025 mg/kg)
# Discharge Criteria for Day Case Surgery

- **Stable Condition**: Vitals and consciousness must be stable.
- **Pain and Nausea**: Pain and nausea/vomiting must be well-controlled.
- **Hydration**: Adequate hydration must be achieved (note: intraoperative fluids count, but postoperative drinks are optional).
- **Urination**: Required if relevant to the surgery (e.g., post caudal or penile surgery).
- **Wound Care**: Wound must be clean and show no signs of bleeding.
- **Parental Approval**: Parents must be satisfied with the condition of the child and agree to take them home.
- **Documentation**: Written information, discharge summary, and a contact number must be provided to the parents.
# Anaesthesia for Magnetic Resonance Imaging
### Provision of Safe Sedation or Anaesthesia for MRI

- **Unique Challenges:**
	- Restricted patient access.
	- Need for remote monitoring with the anaesthetist ideally outside the imaging room.
- **Monitoring Standards:**
	- Adherence to minimal anaesthetic monitoring standards is essential.
- **MR-Compatible Equipment:**
	- Must perform adequately within the magnetic field.
	- Should not pose a threat to patient safety.
	- Must not degrade the MR image.
- **Risks:**
	- Ferromagnetic objects becoming projectiles near the magnetic field.
	- Effect of the magnetic field on pacemakers and other surgical implants.
- **Safety Systems:**
	- Necessary to safeguard health and safety of patients and staff.
- **Considerations for Anaesthetists:**
	- Implications of MR developments on anaesthesia practice.
### Physics of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

- **Historical Background:**
	- Magnetic resonance phenomenon first described in 1945.
	- Used by analytical chemists for MR spectroscopy.
	- MRI of tissues first described in 1973.
	- Preferred imaging technique for many neurological and orthopaedic conditions.
- **Basic Principles:**
	- Atoms with an odd unpaired proton or neutron possess a spin, creating a local magnetic field.
	- Proton nucleus in water molecules is primarily used for MRI.
	- In living tissues, the alignment of these nuclei is random.
- **Magnetic Field Alignment:**
	- Strong magnetic field (superconducting magnet of MR scanner) aligns the nuclei in living tissue.
	- Nuclei are flipped out of alignment by bursts of radio-frequency (RF) energy.
	- Hydrogen nuclei absorb and then release RF energy as they relax.
- **Signal Detection:**
	- Emitted energy measured using an external RF coil.
	- Signal amplitude depends on tissue properties and MR acquisition pulse sequence timing.
	- Two key properties: T1 relaxation and T2 relaxation.
- **Image Characteristics:**
	- T1 or T2 weighted images created by manipulating acquisition sequences.
	- Each tissue has unique T1 and T2 relaxation rates based on its chemical and physical properties.
- **Contrast Agents:**
	- Intravenous agents like gadolinium dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA, Magnevist) alter local magnetic fields.
	- Increase signal intensity on T1 weighted scans and reduce signal intensity on T2 weighted scans.
	- As Gd-DPTA does not cross the intact bloodâ€“brain barrier, it is useful for demonstrating blood-brain barrier breakdown and delineating intracranial pathology.
	- Comparatively safe contrast mediaonly one report of an anaphylactoid reaction.
- **Magnetic Field Gradients:**
	- Employed to give the MRI signal spatial information.
	- Gradient field superimposed on the main magnetic field for spatial encoding.
	- Three orthogonal gradient coils: transverse (X and Y) and longitudinal (Z) planes.
	- Gradient coils produce loud banging noise during MRI.
- **Signal and Image Formation:**
	- Signal strength from a point in the patient determines the grey shade of the corresponding pixel on the image.
	- High signal tissue appears white; low signal tissue appears black, with a spectrum in between.
- **MRI Components:**
	- Hydrogen nuclei (single protons within tissues, mainly water molecules).
	- Strong, uniform external magnetic field (0.1â€“2 Tesla).
	- Pulses of radio-frequency waves.
	- Gradient magnetic fields in XY and Z planes for spatial information.
### Main Indications for MRI as Preferred Imaging Procedure

**Central Nervous System**
- Posterior fossa and infratentorial pathology
- Sinus and orbit pathology
- Inflammatory diseases (encephalitis, cerebritis, myelitis, meningitis)
- Brain abscess
- Acute ischaemic stroke
- Spinal cord soft tissue pathology (congenital abnormality, trauma, tumour, vascular abnormality)
- Myelopathies, demyelination

**Soft Tissue**
- Airway malformations
- Vascular abnormalities
- Liver vascularity
### Radio-Frequency Screening - The Faraday Cage

- **Purpose:** Shields the MR room to prevent interference from extraneous radio signals.
- **Construction:** Built into the fabric of the MR room.
- **Waveguide:** Hollow brass tube to allow infusion lines or monitoring cables to pass into the control room without breaking RF screening integrity.
### The Magnetic Field

- **Generation:** Superconductors cooled by liquid helium to 4.2 Kelvin.
- **Field Strength:** Clinical devices operate between 0.1 and 2.0 Tesla; research systems up to 4.0 Tesla.
- **Field Strength Comparison:**
	- 1 Tesla = 10,000 Gauss.
	- Earthâ€™s magnetic field = 0.5â€“1.0 Gauss.
- **Safety Lines:**
	- Pacemaker line at 0.5 mTesla (5 Gauss).
		- line beyond which pacemakers will malfunction.
	- Other Gauss lines determine safe positions for equipment.
	- Infusion pumps may malfunction >30 Gauss.
	- Ferromagnetic objects become dangerous at approximately 50 Gauss (missile effect).
- **Field Status:** Magnetic field is always on and expensive/risky to shut down.
### Safety of Magnetic Resonance Imaging

#### Patient Safety
- **Risks:** Strong magnetic field affects metal objects attached to or within the patient.
- **Precautions:**
	- Remove all foreign objects
		- jewelry
		- hearing aids
		- drug patches
	- Patient should wear a gown (clothing may contain metal).
- **Absolute Contraindications:**
	- Implanted surgical devices:
		- cochlear implants
		- pacemakers
		- defibrillators
	- Intra-ocular metallic foreign bodies.
	- Ferromagnetic neurovascular surgical clips.
- **Implanted Prosthetics:**
	- Non-ferromagnetic prosthetics generally safe (joint prostheses, heart valves).
	- Ensure safety of prosthetics using pre-scan checklist and resources like [www.mrisafety.com](http://www.mrisafety.com).
- **Noise Levels:** Exceed 85 dB; ear protection required.
#### Staff Safety
- **Precautions:**
	- Similar to patients (remove hazardous items).
	- Screening questionnaires to identify at-risk staff.
	- Training for working in MRI environment.
- **During Scan:**
	- Staff should vacate the room during scanning.
	- Wear ear protection if remaining in the room.
- **Anaesthetic Gases:** Scavenged in usual manner to avoid exposure.
- **Emergency Procedures:**
	- Familiarity with helium gas release protocols.
		- If the magnet is shut down in an emergency (â€˜quenchingâ€™), then release of helium gas can lead to a potentially hypoxic environment.
	- Pregnant staff should avoid MRI, especially in the first trimester.
### Access to the Patient
- **Traditional MR Scanner Design:**
	- Patient placed in the center of the magnetic field, making access and visualization difficult.
- **Open Scanners:**
	- C-shaped magnets allow better access and less intimidation.
	- Operate at lower magnetic field strengths, suitable for certain MR investigations and surgeries.
### Sedation or General Anaesthesia for MRI

#### MRI Challenges
- Noisy and claustrophobic environment.
- Patient must remain motionless during scans (20 min to 1 hour).
#### Anaesthesia Requirements
- **Patients Needing Anaesthesia:** Typically infants and children undergoing neurological examinations.
- **Adults Requiring Anaesthesia:** More likely in women, repeat scans, and those with learning difficulties.
#### Sedation vs. General Anaesthesia
- **Sedation:**
	- Effective in multidisciplinary paediatric teams.
	- Less predictable in non-specialist centres.
- **General Anaesthesia:**
	- Rapid and controlled onset.
	- Ensures immobility.
	- Preferred for sick children and those with raised intracranial pressure.
### General Anaesthesia for MRI

#### Conduct of Anaesthesia
- **Noise Levels:** Loud thumping/tapping may necessitate deeper anaesthesia.
- **Induction Location:** Dedicated anaesthetic room adjacent to MRI scanner, distal to the 5 Gauss line.
- **Patient Transfer:** Use MRI-compatible non-ferrous trolleys.
- **Airway Management:** Laryngeal mask with no ferromagnetic components is widely used.
	- Airway of a patient headfirst into the magnet
		- completely inaccessible
		- â€˜receiver coilâ€™ placed around the area examined which, in the case of a head scan, reduces space for tubes and connections.
			- All connections must be plasti
#### Maintenance of Anaesthesia
- **Methods:** Intravenous or inhalational.
- **Infusion Pumps:** Use long lines from control room to avoid magnetic field issues.
	- Infusion pumps are strongly:
		- ferromagnetic
		- prone to becoming projectile
		- will malfunction if placed near the magnetic field
	- Volatile agents can be given via a vaporiser that is fixed to a suitable anaesthetic machine in the scanning room or in the control room
	- MRI-compatible anaesthetic machines with MRI-compatible ventilators are now made by most of the major manufacturers.
		- These can be sited adjacent to the magnet bore, minimising the length of breathing systems.
			- A co-axial Mapleson D circuit (Bainâ€™s circuit) of suitable length is usually used for adults or an Ayreâ€™s T-piece for children.
			- Anaesthetic machines must be run from piped medical gases and reserve cylinders must be non-ferromagnetic.
- **MRI-Compatible Equipment:**
	- Access to the patient limited
		- use of equipment such as laryngoscopes is not possible in the MRI room (because of the ferromagnetic component of their batteries)
			- Make sure airway is secure before scan
			- Be familiar with the procedure for rapid removal of the patient to a safe area should an emergency arise.
#### Monitoring
- **MR-Compatible Equipment:**
	- Must be non-ferromagnetic
	- Function normally in MR environment
	- Should not emit radio frequencies that interfere with the scan
- **Placement:** Preferably in the control room with cables passed through waveguide ports.
- **Usage:** Essential despite expense to avoid serious problems.
- **Risks with Non-Compatible Equipment:**
	- Changing gradient magnetic fields and radio-frequency currents can induce currents and heating in monitoring leads.
	- Interference with monitoring and potential burns reported.
- MR-compatible systems:
	- **Preferred Materials:** Fibre-optic or carbon fibre cabling.
		- **Advantages:** Avoids heating issues and does not affect scan quality.
		- **Disadvantages:** Expensive and fragile.
	- Power Supplies
		- **Mains Power:** Can carry interference; should be adequately filtered and isolated.
		- **Battery Power:** Batteries are ferromagnetic; equipment must be securely fastened within the magnetic field.
	- Patient Monitoring
		- **Challenges:** Inaccessibility of the patient and lack of visual/auditory cues.
		- **Minimal Monitoring:** Essential for all patients.
		- **Alarm Systems:** Must be visual due to ambient noise levels.
#### Specific Monitoring Equipment

- **Pulse Oximeters:**
	- **MR-Compatible:** Sensitive electronic components kept outside the main field with fibre-optic connections.
	- **Standard Issues:** Severe current induction causing burns (cases of finger loss reported).
- **Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitoring:**
	- Ferrous connections should be changed to nylon.
- **Invasive Pressure Monitoring:**
	- Arterial, venous, or intracerebral possible if signals pass through waveguide radio-frequency filters.
	- Minimize pressure line length to reduce damping.
#### ECG Monitoring

- **Faradayâ€™s Law:** Current induced across conducting fluid in a magnetic field affects blood flow in the aorta.
	- **Result:** ECG changes often mimic hyperkalemia.
	- **Interference Reduction:** Use braided, short (15 cm) leads attached to MRI-compatible electrodes in a narrow triangle on the chest.
#### Capnography

- **Sidestream Capnography:** Long sampling tube leading back to monitoring equipment.
	- **Disadvantage:** Time delay of up to 20 seconds.
#### Familiarity and Training

- **Essential:** Anaesthetists must be familiar with non-standard monitoring equipment in MRI environments.
### Intensive Care Patients

#### MRI Use
- Increasing requests for MRI in adult and neonatal ICU patients with neurological issues.
#### Preparation

- **Endotracheal Tubes:** Securely tape pilot balloon away from scanned area
	- pilot balloon contains small ferromagnetic spring.
- **Lines and Infusion Pumps:** Remove unless essential; extend lines to keep pumps outside 30 Gauss line.
- **Indwelling Catheters:**
	- Theoretical risk of micro-shock through central venous or pulmonary artery catheters in contact with heart muscle and induction of current in epicardial pacing wires.
		- Little risk to patients with a central venous catheter
		- Pulmonary artery catheters with conductive wires and epicardial pacing catheters must be removed before the patient enters the magnet bore.
			- There is a case report of a pulmonary artery catheter thermistor wire melting in the patient because of heat induction during MRI.
		- All in-dwelling catheters should be disconnected from electrical connections and external accessories before the patient enters the magnet.
#### Temperature Maintenance
- **Sick Infants:** The main problem with sick infants is maintenance of body temperature as the MR environment is cold and air-conditioned.
	- At the end of the examination, infants should be returned immediately to a transport incubator.
### Future Developments

#### MRI Units
- Current rate: 4 units per million in the UK, 5.5 per million in Europe.
- Increasing demand with new techniques (orthopaedic soft tissue imaging, dynamic cardiac imaging).
#### MRI-Assisted Operating Rooms
- **Open Scanners:** Allow better patient access.
- **Intraoperative MRI-Guided Neurosurgery:** Smaller devices like Polestar N-10.
#### Anaesthetist Involvement
- Early involvement in commissioning and planning MRI units.
- Ensure safe management of patients in MRI environments.

# Dexmedetomidine in Paediatric Anaesthesia and Intensive Care

### Introduction

- **Trade Names:** Precedex (Hospira, US) and Dexdor (Orion Pharma Ltd, UK).
- **Type:** S-enantiomer of veterinary medicine medetomidine.
	- Similar to clonidine, dexmedetomidine is an imidazoline, a sub-class of Î±2 agonists that demonstrate high specificity and sensitivity for Î±2 compared to Î±1-adrenoreceptors.
	- **Specificity Ratio:** Dexmedetomidine: 1600:1, Clonidine: 200:1.
- **Properties:** Sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic with minimal respiratory depression.
- **Usage:** Increasing popularity in paediatric anaesthesia and intensive care.
- **Current Studies:** Few studies, precise role yet to be determined.
### Mechanism of Action

- **Binding Sites:** Central and peripheral Î±2-adrenoceptors.
- **Sedative and Anxiolytic Effects:**
	- Location: Î±2-adrenoceptors in the locus ceruleus of the pons.
	- Mechanism: Inhibition of adenyl cyclase, decreased cAMP, altered ion channel conductance, and reduced norepinephrine release.
- **Analgesic Effects:**
	- Location: Î±2-adrenoceptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
	- Mechanism: Inhibition of substance P release.
### Pharmacokinetics

- **Administration:** Intravenous (IV).
- **Kinetics:** Exhibits linear pharmacokinetics.
- **Metabolism:** Almost complete metabolism in the liver.
	- **Hepatic Failure:** Clearance decreased to 32% of normal.
	- **Renal Impairment:** Clearance remains unaltered.
- **Comparison:** Similar pharmacokinetics in children and adults.
	- **Neonates:** Reduced clearance due to immature enzymatic pathways.
	- **Adult Values:** Clearance approaches adult levels by about one year of age.

### Physiological Effects of Dexmedetomidine

#### Cardiovascular

- **Heart Rate and Blood Pressure:**
	- Reduction in heart rate (up to 30%, average <15%) following IV loading dose of 0.5 to 1 mcg/kg in children.
	- Depression at atrioventricular (AV) and sinus nodes.
	- Not attenuated by glycopyrrolate premedication, usually not clinically significant.
	- Severe bradycardia reported in a 5-week-old infant post-atrioventricular canal repair with digoxin treatment.
- **Blood Pressure Response:**
	- Biphasic response: initial peripheral vasoconstriction and hypertension with loading dose (>1 mcg/kg).
	- Transient hypertension resolving within 30 minutes.
	- Decrease in systolic blood pressure up to 30% from baseline with 1 mcg/kg loading dose.
	- Less severe drop if dose is omitted or administered slowly (over 10 min).
	- Higher infusion doses (2 to 3 mcg/kg/hr) may cause more profound hypotension.
- **Contraindications:**
	- Avoid in patients with:
		- cardiovascular compromise
		- hypovolemia
		- AV nodal block
		- Those on drugs increasing vagal tone or delaying AV conduction.
- **Treatment of Hypotension and Bradycardia:**
	- Decrease or stop drug, stimulate child, volume expansion, administer atropine or glycopyrrolate.
	- Use anticholinergics with caution; may cause transient hypertension.
	- Further intervention: administer vasopressors (ephedrine or phenylephrine).
#### Respiratory

- **Advantages:**
	- Maintains respiratory drive and airway patency with increasing sedation.
- **Study Results:**
	- Loading dose of 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes showed no change in respiratory rate or oxygen saturation.
	- Combination with sevoflurane or desflurane (low dose infusion: 0.5 mcg/kg/hr) showed no rise in end-tidal pCO2 in spontaneously breathing technique.
	- MRI studies confirm airway patency during sedation.
#### Central Nervous System

- **Sedation:**
	- Resembles endogenous sleep, EEG similar to non-REM sleep patterns.
- **Intracranial Effects in Adults:**
	- No effect on intracranial or cerebral perfusion pressures.
	- Matched reduction in cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate.
- **Analgesic Effects:**
	- Shown in animals, adults, and children via neuraxial route, but off-license and not recommended currently.
#### Effect on Thermal Regulation

- **Effects:**
	- Decreases shivering, vasoconstriction, and non-shivering thermogenesis.
	- Used to terminate postoperative shivering in children >7 years.
	- Reduces centrally mediated metabolic heat production (hypothalamic alpha 2 receptor actibation) and inhibits lipolysis (postsynaptic alpha 2 receptor activation).
- **Considerations:**
	- Monitor temperature and use active warming devices, especially in neonates and infants.
#### Overdose

- **Symptoms:**
	- Associated with transient hypertension and prolonged sedation.
	- Notable absence of respiratory depression.
- **Initial Licensing and Approval:**
	- Licensed in the US for sedation of intubated ICU patients and non-intubated patients before/during procedures.
	- Approved in the EU only for sedation in adult ICU patients.
	- Potential uses in paediatric anaesthesia.
- **Premedication:**
	- Ideal premedication qualities: anxiolysis, sedation, analgesia, haemodynamic stability.
	- Offers antisialogogue effect and reduced gastric secretions.
	- Administration routes: oral, buccal, intranasal.
	- Onset time and duration: oral (30-45 mins onset, 85 mins duration)
		- 2.6 mcg.kg-1 orally successfully sedated 80% of children within 30 minutes
	- Buccal dexmedetomidine 1mcg.kg-1 given 45 minutes preoperatively produced comparable anxiolysis to buccal midazolam 0.5mg.kg-1 administered 30 minutes before anaesthesia, with similar recovery times.
		- The slower onset time of dexmedetomidine limits use when speed of onset is important.
		- Midazolam has an amnesic effect, which is particularly advantageous when children require repeated procedures under anaesthesia.
			- Not yet determined whether dexmedetomidine has an amnesic effect in childre
- **Sedation for Non-Invasive Procedures:**
	- Effective for CT, MRI, EEG in children.
	- Use as sole agent or in combination with other agents such as midazolam.
	- Common dosage: loading dose (1 mcg.kg-1 over 10 mins), infusion (0.5 mcg/kg/hr).
	- Compared to midazolam (0.2 mg/kg followed by 0.36 mg/kg/hr) it has a shorter onset time and a higher rate of adequate sedation (80% vs. 20%).
	- Comparable sedation profile to propofol (3 mg/kg followed by 100 mcg/kg/min), with fewer episodes of hypotension and oxygen desaturation, although slower onset (11 vs. 4min) and recovery (27 vs. 18min) times.
	- To obtain effective sedation in a higher proportion of children (>90%), larger boluses (2 to 3 mcg.kg-1) and infusion rates (up to 2 mcg.kg-1.h-1) of dexmedetomidine may be needed, but hypotension may be seen.
	- Alternatively, agents may be used in combination with dexmedetomidine.
		- In a small study, a single IV bolus of midazolam co-administered with the loading dose of dexmedetomidine produced adequate sedation for MRI in 100% of children.
	- Both oral and parenteral dexmedetomidine appear to be suitable for sedation for EEG studies.
		- EEG during dexmedetomidine sedation resembles that of non rapid eye movement sleep and dexmedetomidine does not interfere with the ability to detect EEG activity.
- **Sedation for Invasive Procedures:**
	- Used for central line placement, chest tube insertion, bronchoscopy, lithotripsy, cardiac catheterization.
	- Often combined with ketamine or propofol for effective sedation.
	- Maintains respiratory drive and haemodynamic stability.
	- Dexmedetomidine 1mcg.kg-1 IV combined with ketamine 1mg.kg-1 provided effective sedation for lithotripsy whilst maintaining respiratory drive and preserving haemodynamic stability.
		- In adults, dexmedetomidine has also been used successfully in combination with propofol or fentanyl for upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy.
- **Prevention and Treatment of Emergence Delirium:**
	- Reduces incidence of emergence delirium post-sevoflurane anaesthesia.
	- Effective dose: 1 mcg.kg-1 IV at end of surgery.
		- Reduce the rate by 90% (to 4.8%), albeit with increased sedation in recovery.
- **Analgesia:**
	- Proven opioid-sparing effect in adults and children.
	- In children, 1 mcg.kg-1 of dexmedetomidine has been shown to give comparable analgesia to morphine 100mcg.kg-1 after tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.
- **Intensive Care Unit:**
	- Effective primary sedative in PICU.
	- Doses: 0.1 to 2.5 mcg.kg-1.h-1 for successful sedation and analgesia.
	- Reduces benzodiazepine and opioid requirements.
	- Used for sedation post-cardiac surgery and facilitates extubation.
		- Dexmedetomidine produces comparable sedation to midazolam, chlorpromazine and fentanyl, with fewer episodes of respiratory depression but increased incidence of bradycardia and hypotension.
	- Potential role in decreasing ICU delirium.
- **Scoliosis Surgery:**
	- Preserves somatosensory and motor-evoked potentials, beneficial for surgeries requiring such monitoring.
- **Cardiac Surgery:**
	- Used to attenuate haemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses at incision, sternotomy, and post-bypass.
- **Awake Craniotomy:**
	- Allows removal of laryngeal mask airway and reliable response during functional mapping.
- **Challenging Patients:**
	- Suitable for patients with obstructive sleep apnoea, difficult airway, or anterior mediastinal mass due to minimal respiratory depression.
- **Other Uses:**
	- Facilitates withdrawal from benzodiazepine and opioid sedation.
	- Treats cyclical vomiting, tachyarrhythmias, and shivering.
