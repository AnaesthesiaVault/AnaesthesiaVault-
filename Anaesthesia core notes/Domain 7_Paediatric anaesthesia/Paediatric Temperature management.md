# Temperature Management in Children
## Introduction
- Temperature management is crucial for anaesthetized patients, particularly neonates and children. Their thermoregulatory systems are more vulnerable to disturbances due to physiological differences. Both **central** and **skin temperatures** contribute to thermal regulation, with the hypothalamus utilizing a **negative feedback system** to maintain a core temperature around **37°C (98.6°F)**, allowing for minor variations depending on the time of day.
- Maintaining **normothermia** during non-cardiac surgery in children is challenging.
- Evidence from adult studies shows even mild **intraoperative hypothermia** is associated with adverse outcomes:
	- Increased surgical site infection
	- Increased risk of adverse cardiac events
	- Coagulopathy
	- Increased transfusion requirements
	- Extended stay in post-anaesthetic care units (PACU)
	- Prolonged hospitalisation
- In children, evidence is limited due to ethical concerns in randomising patients to non-warming groups.
	- **Pearce et al.** conducted an observational study showing that in 52% of children, intraoperative temperature dropped below 36°C, which was associated with increased blood loss and blood product requirements.
- **Cold stress** in neonates leads to:
	- Increased noradrenaline release
	- Increased oxygen and substrate consumption
	- Activation of the sympathetic nervous system may result in:
		- Increased pulmonary vascular resistance
		- Right-to-left shunting
		- Reduced peripheral perfusion and oxygen delivery
		- Acidosis
- Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs, including **muscle relaxants** and **volatile agents**, can be affected by hypothermia.
## Differences Between Children and Adults

Children and neonates differ from adults in several ways:

- **Thinner skin** and **lower fat content** make them more prone to heat loss.
- They have a greater **surface area relative to their weight**, increasing vulnerability to environmental temperature changes.
- **Adults** primarily rely on **shivering** and **arteriovenous shunt vasoconstriction** for cold response, whereas **neonates** depend on **nonshivering thermogenesis (NST)** due to immature thermoregulatory systems.
- **Micro-preemies** are particularly susceptible to **hypothermia**, primarily due to **evaporative** and **insensible fluid losses**, as their epidermis has less keratin and subcutaneous fat.
## Heat Loss Under Anaesthesia
- Children lose more heat than adults during anaesthesia, primarily due to:
	- Less insulating subcutaneous fat
	- Higher surface area-to-volume ratio
- Anaesthesia reduces **basal metabolic heat production** by 20-30% in all ages.
	- Mechanically ventilated neonates miss the heat generated through the work of breathing.
- Central thermoregulation is inhibited, leading to:
	- Vasoconstriction at much lower core temperatures
	- Loss of heat production from **non-shivering thermogenesis** and shivering
### Mechanisms of Heat Loss in the Operating Room

The primary methods of heat loss during anaesthesia are:

1. **Radiation (39%)**: Heat loss from exposed skin or body parts.
2. **Convection (34%)**: Loss of heat to the air surrounding the body.
3. **Evaporation (24%)**: Heat loss from sweat, respiratory mucosa, bowel, and wound surfaces.
4. **Conduction (3%)**: Heat loss through direct contact with cooler objects (e.g., operating table, cold fluids).

These mechanisms must be addressed, especially for **neonates** and **infants**, where the risk of hypothermia is significantly higher.

### Nonshivering Thermogenesis (NST)
**NST** refers to heat production via metabolic energy transformation without skeletal muscle contraction, relying mainly on **brown fat**. This heat production mechanism begins as early as **20–26 weeks gestation**, and brown fat contributes **2%–6%** of a neonate’s body weight. It is located in regions like the **scapulae**, **neck**, **axillae**, and **around vital organs** (e.g., adrenal glands).
The process involves the following steps:
- Cold stress activates **norepinephrine**, stimulating **β-3 receptors** in brown fat.
- This results in increased **lipase activity**, releasing **free fatty acids** which undergo metabolism to produce heat.
- Brown fat, rich in **mitochondria**, plays a key role in this metabolic pathway.
NST becomes clinically relevant a few hours after birth and persists until around **2 years** of age, though it is limited in **premature infants** with deficient fat stores.
### NST Inhibition and Stress

NST is inhibited by various factors:

- **Ganglionic blockers** and **β-receptor blockade** reduce the sympathetic response to cold.
- **Volatile anaesthetics** inhibit NST rapidly (within 5 minutes), with effects persisting for up to 15 minutes after cessation.
- **Neuraxial anaesthesia** impairs thermoregulatory control by inducing a **sympathectomy**, lowering vasoconstriction and shivering thresholds.
- Cold stress itself can lead to **increased oxygen consumption** and **metabolic acidosis**.
## Practicalities of Temperature Monitoring and Warming
### Monitoring
- Various methods exist to measure **core** and **peripheral temperature** in children.
	- Core temperature monitoring sites: rectum, nasopharynx, oesophagus, temporal artery, bladder, tympanic membrane, and blood measurements.
	- Peripheral temperature: axillary thermometry (dependent on close proximity to the axillary artery), skin probes.
- Core temperature monitoring is of greatest value in anaesthetised patients.
	- **Tympanic thermometers** measure thermal radiation from the ear canal and correlate with hypothalamic blood temperature.
		- Can be inaccurate in children with small ear canals.
	- **Nasopharyngeal probes** are placed behind the soft palate but can be affected by the cooling effects of inspired gases, particularly with uncuffed airways.
	- **Oesophageal probes** are reliable but may become inaccurate during specific surgeries, e.g., thoracotomy.
		- Correlates with pulmonary artery temperature in adults during cardiac surgery.
	- **Rectal probes** are commonly used in children but can be influenced by regional blood flow and stool.
		- Lag behind other core temperature readings, especially during rapid temperature changes.
	- **Bladder temperature** correlates well with pulmonary artery temperature in both adults and critically ill children, but requires adequate urine flow.
### Intra-operative Warming Methods
- Warming methods aim to reduce **heat loss** by radiation, conduction, and convection.
#### Preoperative Warming
- Keep children warm with **sheets, blankets, and hats**, especially when transferred long distances.
- Older children should walk to theatre when possible.
- **NICE guidelines** suggest warming adults from induction if anaesthesia lasts more than 30 minutes, especially with combined regional and general anaesthesia or high cardiovascular risk.
	- No clear guidelines exist for children on intraoperative hypothermia risk factors or optimal warming devices.
	- Warming in the anaesthetic room may benefit longer surgeries or those requiring extensive skin exposure.
		- Observational studies show a **forced air warming device** prior to induction can reduce intraoperative hypothermia.
#### Intraoperative Warming
- Limit exposure of large skin areas and avoid pooling of **cleaning fluids**.
- Ventilation gases may be humidified using a **heat and moisture exchanger (HME)**.
- **Forced air warmers**:
	- Can be placed under or over children to reduce radiant and conductive heat loss.
	- Ensure full contact between the child and the warming blanket to prevent burns.
- **Fluid warming**:
	- NICE recommends fluid warmers for adults receiving >500 ml of fluids or any blood products.
		- No specific guidance for children, but it may be useful to apply fluid warmers for larger volumes (e.g., >30 ml/kg).
		- Especially important during procedures involving large fluid or blood loss, such as open abdominal surgery.
### Cautions
- Children receiving active warming are at risk of **overheating**.
	- This can result in:
		- Localised increased skin and muscle blood flow
		- Increased vascular permeability and oedema
		- Cell death and organ failure in severe cases
- Continuous **temperature monitoring** is crucial during active warming to prevent hyperthermia.
## Effects of Hypothermia

Neonates and infants are at a high risk of heat loss, particularly from the head. Hypothermia can be exacerbated by:

- Inadequate warming in the **operating room**.
- Administration of **room-temperature fluids**.
- Use of **dehumidified gases**.
- Effects of **anaesthetic gases** that cause **peripheral vasodilation** and blood redistribution.

Complications of hypothermia include:

- **Coagulopathy**: Reduced platelet aggregation and impaired enzymatic function in the coagulation cascade.
- **Delayed emergence from anaesthesia** and **wound healing**: Due to reduced tissue perfusion and immune cell motility.
- **Cardiac arrhythmias**, **cardiac ischemia**, and **respiratory depression**.
- **Increased pulmonary vascular resistance** and altered **pharmacodynamics**, especially prolonged drug action, including neuromuscular blockers.
- **Impaired immune function** due to reduced inflammatory responses and increased infection risk.
## Warming Techniques and Devices

Preventing hypothermia requires advanced planning. The following methods are effective in maintaining normothermia in neonates and children:

- Maintain a **warm operating room** at around **26°C (80°F)**.
- Use of a **hot air mattress** and pre-warming the operating room bed.
- Warmed **intravenous fluids**, **irrigation fluids**, and **blood products** help minimize heat loss.
- **Heat lamps** and **humidified gases** in the ventilator circuit are also beneficial.
- **Cover the head** and keep the skin **dry** during transport and surgery to reduce evaporative heat loss.

Close **temperature monitoring** is critical to avoid overheating, particularly in infants.
