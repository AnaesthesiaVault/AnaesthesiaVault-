# Perioperative Approach in Pediatric Ophthalmic Surgery

## Pre-Medication and Induction of Anesthesia

- **Tailored Approach:** Medication and induction are specifically adapted to the child's needs, including age, developmental status, and anxiety levels. A considered approach in managing anxiety is crucial.
- **Airway Management:** The airway can be managed with a facemask or a supraglottic airway device (SAD). For IOP measurement, airway manipulation should ideally occur after the IOP has been assessed to prevent artificially high readings. Normal IOP ranges between 10-20 mmHg.

## Examination Under Anesthesia (EUA) and Measurement of Intraocular Pressure (IOP)

- **Necessity for General Anesthesia:** Often required for uncooperative children due to young age or anxiety. Multiple anesthetics may be needed, thus a consistent anesthetic technique is preferable.
- **Inhalation Induction:** A common technique where the ophthalmologist is ready to measure IOP as soon as the child is asleep. Care is taken not to apply external pressure to the eyes with the facemask.
- **Ketamine Induction:** An alternative method using ketamine (1-2 mg/kg IV) helps avoid the risk of artificially low readings. Accompanied by an antisialagogue like atropine or glycopyrolate to manage hypersalivation.

## Common Ophthalmic Conditions

### Glaucoma

- **Pathophysiology:** Often caused by impaired drainage of aqueous humor. High IOP can lead to optic nerve ischemia and potential blindness.
- **Surgical Approach:** Techniques such as goniotomy, trabeculectomy, or trabeculotomy are used to improve aqueous humor drainage. Spontaneous breathing techniques are commonly employed, but neuromuscular blockade can create ideal operating conditions.
- **Anesthesia Considerations:** Use of a remifentanil infusion may provide adequate intraoperative analgesia, reducing the need for neuromuscular blockade.

### Cataracts

- **Etiology:** Can be inherited, part of syndromes, or acquired after trauma or infection. Congenital cataracts in neonates require early surgery to preserve sight.
- **Surgical Management:** Typically involves lensectomy and artificial lens implantation.
- **Anesthesia Goals:** Aim to provide a motionless eye and ensure smooth emergence from anesthesia.

### Strabismus Surgery

- **Incidence and Pain Management:** Affects 3-5% of the population. Surgery can be painful; use of morphine has been shown to manage pain effectively without increasing PONV.
- **Oculocardiac Reflex (OCR) and PONV:** High incidence of OCR and PONV. A sub-Tenon’s block at the beginning or end of surgery can prevent OCR and reduce PONV. Combination of dexamethasone and ondansetron is effective in reducing PONV.
- **Anesthetic Approach:** TIVA may be beneficial. Preoperative and intraoperative use of paracetamol, NSAIDs, and local anesthetic eye drops (tetracaine 0.5% or oxybuprocaine 0.4%) are recommended.

### Blocked Nasolacrimal Ducts

- **Procedure:** May require surgical probing under general anesthesia. In more complex cases, procedures like fracturing of the inferior turbinate or dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) to create a new passage into the nasal cavity might be needed.
- **Anesthesia Management:** Short-acting opioids and topical vasoconstrictors like xylometazoline may be necessary to manage pain and control bleeding. Throat packs are used to protect the airway from aspiration.

## Maintenance of Anesthesia

- **Agent Selection:** The choice between volatile agents like isoflurane or sevoflurane and TIVA (typically with propofol and remifentanil) is influenced by the need to minimize PONV and the effect on IOP, avoiding nitrous oxide due to its potential to increase PONV and IOP.

## Oculo-cardiac Reflex (OCR)

#### Overview

Strabismus surgery has a significant potential for triggering the oculocardiac reflex (OCR), which can lead to notable cardiac effects during the procedure.

#### Pathways of the OCR

- **Afferent Pathway (COG4):**
  - Ciliary ganglion
  - Ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve
  - Gasserian ganglion
  - Main sensory nucleus of the fourth ventricle
- **Efferent Pathway:**
  - Vagus nerve

#### Clinical Manifestation
- **Sinus bradycardia** is the most common manifestation of OCR.
- Severe cases may result in **sinus arrest**.

#### Intraoperative Trigger Factors for OCR
- Hypoxia
- Hypercarbia
- Pain
- Operative traction on the extraocular muscles

#### Prophylaxis
- Prophylactic administration of **anticholinergic agents** (e.g., atropine or glycopyrrolate) in children is effective in preventing the OCR during strabismus surgery.

## Extubation and Emergence

- **Techniques:** To mitigate potential rises in IOP during extubation, deep extubation techniques are preferred, unless contraindications such as a full stomach or difficult airway management exist.

## Analgesia and Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) Management

- **Multimodal Analgesia:** Emphasizes the use of NSAIDs, paracetamol, and local anesthetics for basic pain management, escalating to include opioids when necessary while managing the high risk of PONV with dual antiemetic therapy.
# Anaesthesia for Ophthalmic Emergencies

#### Traumatic Eye Injuries

- **Commonality**: Eye injuries, especially traumatic, are frequent in children. These can occur as isolated incidents or alongside polytrauma.
- **Types of Injuries**:
	- **Extraocular**: Involves muscles and soft tissues surrounding the eye.
	- **Orbital**: Involves the bony eye socket.
	- **Ocular**: Involves the globe (the eyeball), classified as:
		- **Open globe**: Full-thickness breach of the sclera or cornea.
		- **Closed globe**: No full-thickness breach.
	- **Open Globe Injuries**: These are critical and require urgent surgical intervention within 12-24 hours to prevent extrusion of ocular contents, endophthalmitis, and vision loss.
		- **Orbital Floor Fractures**: These fractures can entrap extraocular muscles, restricting eye movement and triggering the oculocardiac reflex (OCR), which necessitates urgent surgery.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- **Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI)**: Preferred in unfasted patients due to risk of aspiration. **Rocuronium** is favored over **suxamethonium** due to the latter's transient increase in intraocular pressure (IOP).
	- **Controlled Ventilation**: Normocapnia (4.5-5.0 kPa) should be maintained, and care must be taken to avoid external pressure on the injured eye.
	- **Ketamine**: Generally avoided due to its potential to increase IOP unless hemodynamic instability is a significant concern.
	- **Local Anaesthesia**: In a minority of cases, foreign body removal can be performed under local anaesthesia using proxymetacaine.

# Vitreoretinal Surgery: Retinal Detachment

- **Cause**: Retinal detachment involves a tear in the retina, allowing vitreous humor to leak, leading to retinal separation. It can be sight-threatening, often caused by trauma or conditions like retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), retinoblastoma, and Stickler syndrome.
- **Treatment**:
	- **Smaller Tears**: Cryotherapy or laser treatment.
	- **Larger Detachments**: Vitrectomy with silicone oil or gas (e.g., C2F6) injection into the posterior chamber, or scleral buckling to compress the sclera.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- **Sub-Tenon’s Block**: Provides perioperative analgesia, reduces the OCR, and minimizes opioid requirements.
	- **Postoperative Care**: Avoid nitrous oxide for 12 weeks post-surgery if intraocular gas was used due to the risk of gas expansion.

# Anaesthesia for Specialist Ophthalmic Surgeries

1. **Corneal Grafts**:
	
	- **Indications**: Neonatal congenital opacities or scarring from trauma or infection in older children.
	- **Anaesthetic Requirements**:
		- Neuromuscular blockade and controlled ventilation to avoid IOP increase.
		- Smooth extubation or the use of a supraglottic airway device (SAD) to avoid coughing.
		- Sub-Tenon’s block for analgesia and akinesia, contraindicated in infections.
2. **Retinoblastoma**:
	
	- **Characteristics**: Most common intraocular malignancy in children, presenting with leukocoria (white reflex in the pupil).
	- **Treatment**:
		- Frequent EUAs and treatments like cryotherapy, laser, or systemic chemotherapy.
		- **Intra-Arterial Chemotherapy (IAC)**: Involves Melphalan infusion into the ophthalmic artery, requiring general anaesthesia with neuromuscular blockade.
		- **Anaesthetic Challenges**: Remote site anaesthesia, potential life-threatening autonomic reactions (e.g., myocardial stunning, bronchospasm). Prophylactic atropine and adrenaline should be readily available.
3. **Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)**:
	
	- **Cause**: Abnormal retinal vessel growth in premature neonates, potentially leading to retinal detachment.
	- **Treatment**:
		- First-line: Argon diode laser ablation, often performed under sedation in NICU.
		- Newer therapy: Intravitreal anti-VEGF (e.g., bevacizumab) to inhibit angiogenesis.
		- **General Anaesthesia**: Needed for laser or cryotherapy, especially in more severe cases, with controlled ventilation, opioid analgesia, and post-operative ventilatory support for neonates with significant comorbidities.
		- **Emerging Surgery**: Endoscopic vitrectomy for retinal detachment, requiring urgent intervention and postoperative NICU support.
