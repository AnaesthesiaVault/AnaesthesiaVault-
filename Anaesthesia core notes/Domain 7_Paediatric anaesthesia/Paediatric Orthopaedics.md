### Introduction to Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgery in LMICs

- **Range of Conditions**:
	- **Trauma**: Includes simple and complex fractures, often complicated by delayed presentation, anaemia, nutritional deficiency, chronic osteomyelitis, fracture non-union, and polytrauma.
	- **Elective Procedures**: In children with cerebral palsy and other complex conditions.
- **Content Focus**:
	- Spectrum of disorders in paediatric orthopaedic surgery in LMICs.
	- Orthopaedic manifestations of specific childhood conditions.
	- Specific orthopaedic procedures and their anaesthetic management.
### Spectrum of Disorders in Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgery

- **Trauma**:
	- Includes acute/delayed fractures, burns, polytrauma, traumatic paraplegia, conflict-related injuries.
- **Common Congenital Conditions**:
	- Talipes equinovarus (club foot), scoliosis, other congenital limb deformities, achondroplasia, bone cysts.
- **Infections**:
	- Osteomyelitis (acute, untreated, chronic), tuberculosis (TB), poliomyelitis.
- **Developmental Abnormalities**:
	- Developmental dysplasia of the hip (CDH), Perthes disease, slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE), idiopathic scoliosis.
- **Neuromuscular Conditions**:
	- Muscular dystrophies, progressive muscular atrophy, poliomyelitis, scoliosis.
- **Neurological Conditions**:
	- Cerebral palsy, spina bifida.
- **Auto-immune Conditions**:
	- Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
- **Tumours**:
	- Sarcomas, osteochondromas.
- **Rare Congenital Conditions**:
	- Osteogenesis imperfecta, neurofibromatosis, mucopolysaccharidosis (Hunter’s, Hurler’s), arthrogryposis multiplex.
### Common Orthopaedic Conditions in LMICs

- **Trauma**:
	- High prevalence of acute fractures and burns with significant morbidity.
	- Many fractures treated non-surgically (e.g., with traction or casting).
	- Fracture manipulation under anaesthesia is a common procedure.
	- Paediatric musculoskeletal impairment (MSI) has a prevalence of 2.6-4.8% in children under 12 years.
	- High incidence of angular limb deformity and fracture non/mal-union in elective surgery cases.
	- Polytrauma and burns are challenging and associated with high mortality.
- **Congenital Talipes Equinovarus (Clubfoot)**:
	- Higher prevalence in developing countries (e.g., 2 per 1000 children in Malawi, double that of North America and Europe).
	- Despite widespread Ponseti serial casting programmes, disability from untreated or partially treated clubfoot remains high.
### Case Selection in Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgery

- **Key Factors for Success**:
	- Choose cases that require little or no follow-up, are inexpensive, require minimal instrumentation, and do not need specialized surgical skills.
	- Most children with cerebral palsy benefit more from prolonged physiotherapy than from surgical intervention due to time and cost.
- **Five Common Orthopaedic Conditions for Operative Intervention**:
	1. **Neglected or Recurrent Talipes (Clubfoot)**: Procedures include postero-medial release, posterior release, wedge tarsectomy, or triple arthrodesis.
	2. **Chronic Osteomyelitis**: Sequestrectomy and debridement, with attention to potential intra-articular spread if adjacent to a joint.
	3. **Angular Limb Deformities**: Often caused by malnutrition (e.g., rickets) or developmental disorders (e.g., Blount’s disease); treated with open osteotomy and casting.
	4. **Burns Contractures**: Releases and skin grafting, especially involving the hands.
	5. **Open Fracture**: Requires washout and debridement.
### Anaesthetic Management of Children for Orthopaedic Surgery

- **Pre-Operative Assessment and Preparation**:
	- Full history and examination with a parent present; focus on co-existing conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, cardiorespiratory disease).
	- Review previous anaesthetic experiences if available.
	- Manage pain with a cast, sling, traction, oral analgesia, IV morphine, or regional block (e.g., femoral nerve block).
	- Standard starvation protocol; extra caution if delayed gastric emptying is suspected.
	- Pre-medication generally not needed but may be used for children with learning difficulties or previous difficult experiences.
	- Simple oral analgesics (e.g., paracetamol, ibuprofen) can be given as premedication.
	- Focused physical examination and appropriate investigations, particularly for major surgery or cardiorespiratory concerns.
	- Explain the anaesthetic plan to parents and child, and obtain consent.
- **Anaesthetic Technique**:
	- Technique depends on surgery and available resources.
	- Local anaesthesia used for some procedures (e.g., tendon release in Ponseti procedure).
	- IM or IV ketamine and regional anaesthesia may be used; GA with spontaneous breathing supplemented by regional block or local infiltration is common.
	- Secure IV access is best practice, particularly for stimulating procedures like fracture manipulation.
	- Multi-modal analgesia (ketamine, oral analgesics, regional block/local infiltration, +/- opioids) is preferred.
	- Provide intravenous fluids to rehydrate and replace intra-operative losses; good hydration reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting.
	- Open procedures require prophylactic antibiotics before skin incision.
### Regional Anaesthesia in Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgery

- **Specific Considerations**:
	- **Choice of Block**: Decide based on the procedure, location, and desired duration; consider the child’s and parents’ previous experience.
	- **Lower Extremity Surgery**:
		- Caudal block is simple and effective for lower limb procedures.
		- Femoral/3:1 or popliteal sciatic blocks are useful for unilateral limb surgery; popliteal blocks cover procedures below the knee.
		- Ankle blocks are effective for foot procedures.
	- **Hip Surgery**:
		- Requires a higher block, usually an epidural, for prolonged analgesia.
		- Lumbar epidurals are performed under general anaesthesia in children.
	- **Spinal Anaesthesia**:
		- An alternative to GA in older children; safe and cost-effective with appropriate equipment and experienced providers.
	- **Upper Extremity Surgery**:
		- Brachial plexus block at the axilla is effective for wrist and hand surgery; may be supplemented with local infiltration or ketamine.
		- Supraclavicular or interscalene blocks may be used by experts for anaesthesia or analgesia
### Blood Loss and Blood Conservation in Orthopaedic Surgery

- **Importance**:
	- Essential due to common chronic anaemia, limited access to safe blood transfusion, and potential for significant blood loss during surgery in LMICs.
- **Blood Conservation Techniques**:
	- Use of tourniquets where possible.
	- Optimize preoperative haemoglobin with de-worming and iron supplements.
	- Maintain a stable anaesthetic with good analgesia; control heart rate and blood pressure in the low normal range.
	- Maintain normothermia to prevent coagulation problems; limit patient exposure.
	- Position child to reduce venous congestion and avoid hypercarbia and coughing.
	- Administer tranexamic acid (10-20 mg/kg IV at induction, repeat 10 mg/kg IV at 4 hours).
	- Follow clearly defined transfusion protocols; healthy children can tolerate haemoglobin levels down to 7 g/dl.
	- Intraand post-operative cell salvage is useful if available.
	- Use whole blood or "reconstituted whole blood" for major blood loss (>50% of circulating blood volume).
### Specific Conditions Requiring Orthopaedic Surgery

- ### Cerebral Palsy
	- Most children presenting for surgery in LMICs have mild deficits affecting one or two limbs; severe cases are less common.
	- Intellectual disability and epilepsy are common, especially in spastic quadriplegic CP.
	- Bulbar muscle involvement leads to poor control of mouth, tongue, and pharynx, increasing the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
	- Dyskinetic CP may involve deafness, dysarthria, and drooling.

### Anaesthetic Implications of CP

- **Cognitive, Communication, and Behavioural Disorders**: Present in many children.
- **Epilepsy**: Affects 30% of children with CP.
- **Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux**: Common and may cause recurrent respiratory issues.
- **Drooling**: Related to pseudobulbar palsy, with impaired swallowing or tongue thrusting.
- **Poor Nutritional Status**: Potential for electrolyte imbalance or anaemia.
- **Respiratory Problems**: Poor reserve, subclinical pulmonary aspiration, recurrent infections, chronic lung disease.
- **Poor Dentition**: Dental caries, loose teeth, and risk of bacteraemia during airway instrumentation.
- **Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction**: Increased incidence of malocclusion; potential for difficult intubation.
- **Autonomic Neuropathy**: Poor control of temperature and blood pressure; intraoperative hypothermia is common.
- **Difficult Venous Access**: Due to spasticity or dystonia.
### Preoperative Considerations for CP Patients

- Assess by a paediatrician to ensure fitness for surgery.
- Continue anticonvulsant therapy perioperatively.
- Preoperative physiotherapy, bronchodilators, and antibiotics may be required.
- Multiple blood pressure readings should be taken to establish a baseline.
- Keep the child warm and avoid unnecessary exposure.
### Orthopaedic Procedures in CP Patients

- **Common Surgeries**: Soft tissue releases to relieve contractures; repeat procedures are common.
- **Recent Trends**: Single event multilevel surgery involving tenotomies and/or osteotomies on one or both limbs.
### Conduct of Anaesthesia for CP Patients

- Build rapport and engage the child in discussions; involve the carer during induction and recovery.
- Consider sedative premedication but be aware of unpredictable responses.
- Use antacids, prokinetics, and drugs to reduce secretions.
- Thiopentone is useful for IV induction in children with epilepsy.
- Intubate if reflux is present; position the child carefully to prevent pressure sores and nerve/muscle damage.
- Children with severe CP may have reduced anaesthetic requirements and prolonged recovery times.
- **Muscle Spasms**: Common in spastic CP; regional techniques strongly recommended for analgesia.
- **Postoperative Care**:
	- Monitor for drooling; frequent suctioning may be necessary.
	- Risk of aspiration in children with pseudobulbar palsy.
	- Irritability on emergence is common but can be challenging to assess.

### Neuromuscular Disorders

![[E0661E27-3C3A-468A-88C7-EDBD2130EA0D.jpeg]]

- **Diagnosis and Information Gathering**:
	- Most children have a clear diagnosis; if not, assess the duration, stability, and nature of muscle weakness.
	- Discuss major cases with a neurologist or paediatrician.
	- Continue all medications preoperatively and restart them as soon as possible postoperatively.
- **Anaesthetic Assessment**:
	- Evaluate current status, airway, cardio-respiratory, and other system disorders.
	- Principal risks: airway issues, respiratory impairment, poor myocardial function, gastro-oesophageal reflux, abnormal drug reactions (e.g., MH), and excess bleeding in certain myopathies (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy, DMD).
	- Investigations should be done in consultation with respiratory paediatricians or cardiologists.
	- Counsel the family on the prognosis and realistic expectations for surgery.
- **Functional Capacity Assessment**:
	- Exercise assessment helps identify cardio-respiratory or airway compromise.
	- Inactive children may have masked severity of respiratory or cardiac disease.
	- Sleep studies or overnight oxygen saturation monitoring can provide useful information.
	- Children on non-invasive ventilatory support can be safely anaesthetised; ensure familiarity with the device and settings preoperatively.
- **Cardiomyopathy Considerations**:
	- DMD is associated with cardiac muscle degeneration, conduction defects, and cardiomyopathy in later adolescence.
	- Friedrich’s ataxia is also linked to cardiomyopathy.
	- Dysphagia and decreased gastric motility are common.
- **Previous Anaesthetic Review**:
	- A history of uneventful anaesthetics does not guarantee future safety, particularly concerning airway or respiratory events.
	- Previous safe use of suxamethonium or volatile agents does not ensure subsequent safety.
### Perioperative Management

- **Family Discussion**:
	- Discuss potential risks and benefits of surgery with the family.
	- Use sedative pre-medication cautiously, as it may cause respiratory depression or reduced muscle tone, though anxiety management is important.
- **Anaesthetic Technique**:
	- Spontaneous ventilation techniques may not be well tolerated.
	- TIVA with propofol and remifentanil is safe and effective, provided cardiac function is not severely impaired.
	- Choice of anaesthetic technique must be individualized, considering factors like difficult intubation or severe respiratory impairment.
	- Avoid large doses of opioids, especially where ventilatory support is limited or unavailable.
- **Monitoring**:
	- Closely monitor all cases, including core body temperature, due to risks of hypoand hyperthermia.
	- Postoperative monitoring should ideally occur in a high-dependency area, with intensive care and ventilatory support available for high-risk cases.
- **Neuromuscular Blocking Agents**:
	- Children with neuromuscular diseases are more sensitive to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers.
	- Use a nerve stimulator and short-acting neuromuscular blocking agents.
	- **Suxamethonium** must NOT be used due to risks of severe hyperkalemia and potential for MH or AIR.
- **Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) and Anaesthesia-Induced Rhabdomyolysis (AIR)**:
	- Conditions definitively linked to MH: King-Denborough syndrome, central core disease, and Evans myopathy.
	- MH-like symptoms can occur in other neuromuscular conditions, but the link to true MH is unclear.
- **Muscle Biopsy Considerations**:
	- Muscle biopsy has a 10-20% chance of a positive finding, often leading to a muscular dystrophy diagnosis.
	- Avoid volatile agents; prefer TIVA or spinal anaesthesia with sedation.
### Specific Orthopaedic Procedures

- **Surgery for Osteomyelitis and Septic Arthritis**:
	- **Septic Arthritis**: Orthopaedic emergency requiring urgent open or arthroscopic washout.
	- **Osteomyelitis**: Requires thorough debridement, removal of dead bone (sequestrum), and possible decortication to allow drainage. Soft tissues heal by secondary intention with regular dressing changes.
	- Affected children may be chronically unwell, anaemic, and have impaired clotting.
- **Ponseti Procedure**:
	- Technique for correcting congenital clubfoot without surgery through manipulation and casting.
	- No anaesthesia needed for initial phases; percutaneous tenotomy can be done with local anaesthesia.
	- In 10-30% of cases, a tibialis anterior tendon transfer may be required at around 3 years old, needing general anaesthesia.
- **Application of Hip Spica Casts**:
	- Used to stabilize and immobilize femoral fractures and hip abnormalities.
	- Anaesthesia is usually required, with focus on haemodynamic stability and safe patient positioning.
	- Intubation may be considered in children <10 kg due to potential abdominal compression during application.
- **Pelvic Osteotomies for Congenital Dislocation of the Hip (CDH)**:
	- Corrects developmental dysplasia to stabilize the hip, allowing corrective remodeling and preventing early osteoarthritis.
	- Choice of osteotomy depends on the severity of dysplasia and age.
	- Procedures may be long with significant blood loss; combine general anaesthesia with spinal or epidural analgesia for pain control.
- **Slipped Upper Femoral Epiphysis (SUFE)**:
	- A condition in children aged 8-15 due to weakness in the growth plate, causing slippage of the femoral head.
	- SUFE is an orthopaedic emergency to prevent avascular necrosis.
	- Surgery involves placing percutaneous screws into the femoral head; the opposite hip may also be fixed.
	- Associated with obesity, endocrine abnormalities, and renal osteodystrophy.
	- Preoperative investigations include blood tests and thyroid screening.
	- General anaesthesia combined with regional anaesthesia is common; a caudal or epidural can be helpful.
- **Treatment of Limb Deformity and Leg Length Inequality**:
	- Treatment depends on the patient's age and the cause of the inequality.
	- **Epiphysiodesis**: Slows growth of the longer leg in growing children using small screws and plates (8 plates).
	- **Application of External Fixator**: Taylor spatial frame treats complex fractures and deformities; anaesthesia depends on patient health and co-morbidities. Discuss regional blocks with the surgeon to avoid masking compartment syndrome.
- **Scoliosis/Spinal Deformity Surgery**:
	- Surgery is often cosmetic, especially in idiopathic scoliosis, but can improve sitting balance, pain, or life expectancy in children with neuromuscular disorders.
	- Posterior approach is common, with spinal fixation or growing rod systems.
	- Historically associated with major blood loss and cord injury, but modern techniques, including spinal cord monitoring, have reduced risks.
	- Optimal anaesthesia for spinal cord monitoring: TIVA with propofol and remifentanil.
	- Postoperative analgesia options include epidural (if no contraindications) or balanced IV analgesia with morphine, ketamine, and oral medications.
