# Neurophysiology

## Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF)
- **Varies with age:**
  - **Newborn:** 40 ml/100g/min, lower than adults.
  - **6 months to 3 years:** 90 ml/100g/min, higher than adults.
  - **3 to 12 years:** 100 ml/100g/min, approximates adult levels.
- **Autoregulation range:** Unclear in infants and children but likely to be between 40–90 mmHg.

## Cerebral Metabolic Rate (CMR)
- **Children:** Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) is 5.2 ml/100g/min, higher than adults (3.5 ml/100g/min).
- **Neonates:** Lower CMRO2 (2.3 ml/100g/min) and lower CBF, with relative tolerance to hypoxemia.
- **Relation to CBF:** Higher CBF and glucose usage in children reflect the increased CMRO2.

## Arterial Carbon Dioxide/Oxygen Tension (PaCO2/PaO2)
- **PaCO2:**
  - Potent vasodilator for cerebral vessels, linear increase in CBF between PaCO2 of 3.5 and 8 kPa.
  - **Newborns:** Moderate hypocapnia has less effect on CBF compared to adults until severe levels are reached.
- **PaO2:**
  - **Adults:** CBF only increases when PaO2 drops below 50 mmHg, leading to an exponential rise.
  - **Neonates:** CBF increases with smaller decreases in PaO2. CBF doubles at PaO2 of 4 kPa and begins rising at PaO2 of 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg).

## Intracranial Pressure (ICP)
- **Normal values:**
  - **Children:** 2–10 mmHg.
  - **Adults:** 8–18 mmHg.
- **Fontanelle closure:**
  - Posterior fontanelle closes by 6 months.
  - Anterior fontanelle closes by 12–18 months.
  - Final cranial suture closure may occur up to 10 years.
- **Temperature effect:** For every 1°C increase in body temperature, CMR increases by 5%, leading to an increase in CBF and ICP.

# Anaesthesia for Neurosurgery

## Key Considerations
- **Limited airway access**: Due to surgical positioning.
- **Managing increased ICP**: Optimize surgical exposure and maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).
- **Neuromonitoring**: Essential for intraoperative neurological assessment.
- **Emergence:** Smooth, controlled emergence for accurate postoperative neurological evaluation.
- **Potential complications:** Venous air embolism, hemorrhage, arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability.

## Anaesthetic Goals
- **Cerebral protection**: Maintain CPP, minimize ICP, use neuroprotective strategies (e.g., controlled temperature, barbiturates).
- **Facilitate post-op evaluation**: Minimize long-acting sedatives.
- **Facilitate intraoperative neuromonitoring**.

## Anaesthetic Technique
- **Induction**:
  - Propofol 2–3 mg/kg with remifentanil (0.2–0.5 µg/kg/min).
  - Fentanyl 5 µg/kg at induction, followed by top-ups or alfentanil infusion (25–50 µg/kg/hr) if remifentanil is unavailable.
  - Lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg or β-blocker (labetalol 5 mg increments) to blunt responses.
  - Use slow IV induction to avoid reducing BP and CPP.
  - Non-depolarizing muscle relaxant for intubation.
  - **Endotracheal tube:** Armored ETT to prevent kinking, secured with tape (not ties, to avoid venous obstruction).
- **Eye protection**: Ensure ocular safety during surgery.
- **Avoid N2O**: Increases CBF, CMRO2, and ICP, especially post-op with pneumocephalus.
- **Maintenance**:
  - Use sevoflurane/isoflurane (<1 MAC) or TCI propofol (3–6 µg/mL), with reduced remifentanil infusion (0.15–0.25 µg/kg/min).
  - Maintain PaCO2 between 4.0–4.5 kPa.
- **Positioning**: Avoid extreme neck flexion/rotation to maintain venous return. Ensure proper head-up tilt.
- **Mayfield head fixation**: Infiltrate pin sites with local anesthetic (LA); use remifentanil or propofol to manage hypertensive responses.

## Awake Craniotomy
- Allows intraoperative neurological assessment and precise mapping for tumour resection in eloquent areas (e.g., motor, speech).
- **Technique:**
  - TCI propofol and remifentanil (0.05–1 µg/kg/min).
  - LMA used until tumour exposure, then propofol stopped and remifentanil reduced for spontaneous ventilation (SV) return.
  - After resection, the patient is re-anaesthetized, and LMA reinserted.
- **Prophylaxis**: Anticonvulsants, dexamethasone, and ondansetron (4 mg IV) for tumour surgery.

# Management of Raised ICP

1. **Avoid factors that increase CBF**:
   - Prevent hypercapnia, hypoxia, hypertension, hyper/hypoglycemia, and hyperthermia.
   - Use IPPV to control PaCO2 and ensure oxygenation, analgesia, and adequate anaesthetic depth.
   
2. **Avoid increasing venous pressure**:
   - Prevent coughing, straining, and head-down positioning.
   - Avoid obstructing neck veins (e.g., from ETT ties).
   
3. **Prevent further cerebral oedema**:
   - Avoid fluid overload. Restrict IV fluids to 30 mL/kg/day if cerebral oedema is present.
   - Use hypertonic solutions to maintain high normal plasma osmolality.
   
4. **Maintain CPP**:
   - Aim for CPP >60 mmHg.
   - Avoid anaesthetic agents that increase ICP.

5. **Specific measures to decrease ICP**:
   - **Osmotherapy**: Mannitol (0.25–1 g/kg over 15 min) or 5% saline (100 mL) with furosemide (0.25–1 mg/kg).
   - **Modest hyperventilation**: Target PaCO2 of 4.0–4.5 kPa (30–34 mmHg).
   - **Corticosteroids**: Reduce oedema in tumours/abscesses (e.g., dexamethasone 4 mg 6-hourly).
   - **CSF drainage**: Via ventricular/lumbar drain if required.
   - **Positioning**: Head-up tilt of 30° to reduce central venous pressure (CVP).

6. **Prevent seizures**:
   - Use prophylactic or therapeutic phenytoin (loading dose: 15 mg/kg; maintenance: 3–4 mg/kg/day).

7. **Monitoring**:
   - Arterial line, CVP, neuromuscular monitoring, and core temperature. Insert a urinary catheter for diuresis monitoring.

# Venous Air Embolism (VAE)
## Paediatrics/VAE
- **Higher Susceptibility:**
  - The **head lies above the heart**, even in a supine position, and represents a greater proportion of body surface area compared to adults.
  - **Dural sinuses and diploic veins** are held open by bony connections, increasing the risk of air entry during surgery.
  - **Cardiac shunts** increase the risk of paradoxical air emboli, where even small volumes of air can be significant. Detection methods include end-tidal CO2 monitoring, arterial catheterization, and precordial Doppler. Both waveforms show a sudden decrease due to a drop in cardiac output.
  
- **Management:**
  - The **surgeon should immediately occlude entry points** and flood the surgical field with saline.
  - **Additional maneuvers** include jugular venous compression, head-down tilt, and air aspiration via central venous catheter (CVC).
  - The primary treatment is to provide **cardiorespiratory support**.

# Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
- Children are particularly prone to head injury due to a **larger head-to-body ratio** and **weaker neck muscles**.
- Always consider **non-accidental injury** in paediatric trauma cases.

## Primary Injury
- Occurs at the time of the initial trauma, resulting in:
  - Brain contusion, laceration, haematoma formation, or diffuse axonal injury.
  - **Younger children:** Tend to present with subdural haematomas and diffuse cerebral oedema without skull fractures.
  - **Older children:** Skull fractures, contusions, and extradural haematomas are more common.

## Secondary Injury
- Occurs minutes to days after the initial trauma and is linked to hypotension, raised ICP, or cerebral ischemia.
- Worsening factors include hypoxia, hypercarbia, anaemia, pyrexia, hypoglycaemia, or hyperglycaemia.

## Assessment
- **Modified Glasgow Coma Scale for Children** and **AVPU score** (Alert, responds to Verbal commands, responds to Pain, Unresponsive) allow rapid neurological assessment.

### Pupil Responses
- **Bilateral fixed and dilated pupils:** Sign of inadequate cerebral perfusion or irreversible brain injury.
- **Bilateral pupil constriction:** May indicate early brain herniation, brainstem injury, or opioid side effects.
- **Unilateral fixed and dilated pupil:** Suggests brain herniation through the tentorium cerebelli or optic nerve injury.
- **Unilateral pupil constriction:** May indicate unilateral brainstem injury or Horner’s syndrome.

### Features Indicative of Severe Head Injury
- History of:
  - Falls from height, high-speed road traffic accidents, or incidents involving pedestrians/cyclists.
  - Loss or reduced level of consciousness.
  - **Signs of skull fractures** (e.g., panda eyes, CSF/blood in the ear, mastoid bruising).
- Glasgow Coma Score ≤8 or loss of ability to localize pain in the motor category.

### Indications for CT Scan
- Suspicion of severe head injury, reduced consciousness, amnesia, abnormal drowsiness.
- Skull fractures (basal, open, or depressed).
- Seizures, neurological deficits, or persistent vomiting.
- High-risk injury mechanism or suspicion of non-accidental injury.

## Considerations
- **Impaired autoregulation:** Maintain CPP between 50–70 mmHg (MAP 70–90 mmHg), assuming ICP of 20 mmHg. CPP <50 mmHg is associated with poor outcomes.
- **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC):** Penetrating injuries release brain tissue into circulation.
- **Autonomic changes:** Intense vasoconstriction and hypertension.
- **Neurogenic pulmonary oedema** and **electrolyte abnormalities** (cerebral salt wasting, diabetes insipidus) may occur.
- Maintain plasma sodium and osmolality within the high normal range (plasma sodium target: 150 mmol/L in severe cases).

## Management

Refer to ATLS and trauma notes.

### Indications for Intubation
- Glasgow Coma Score ≤8 or inability to localize pain.
- Inadequate breathing (SpO2 <95%, hyperventilation/hypoventilation).
- PaO2 <9 kPa (in air) or PaCO2 <3.5/>6 kPa.
- Loss of protective laryngeal reflexes.
- Significant facial or neck injuries, or seizures.

### Cardiovascular Management
- **Expected systolic BP (mmHg):** 80 + (age in years × 2).
- Maintain CPP between 50–70 mmHg (MAP 70–90 mmHg).
- Transfuse if haemoglobin <7 g/dL.

### Summary of Management
- **Positioning:** 30° head-up with neutral head positioning.
- Maintain SpO2 >95%.
- Target PaCO2: 4.5–5.0 kPa.
- Maintain blood pressure in the high/normal range.
- Avoid excessive fluid loading and hypotonic fluids containing dextrose.
- Aim for plasma sodium between 145–150 mmol/L.
- Use inotropes (e.g., noradrenaline) if necessary to maintain blood pressure.
- Provide adequate sedation and analgesia.
- Maintain normoglycemia.
- Treat hyperthermia aggressively.
- Control seizures.
- Provide early nutrition via nasogastric tube.

# Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) Shunt
## Paediatrics/VP-Shunt
- Normal ICP range in neonates and infants: 0–6 mmHg.
- Children with congenital hydrocephalus often have **multisystem disorders**, such as congenital heart disease or spinal defects related to premature birth.
- These children may undergo **multiple shunt revisions** and often have comorbidities such as cerebral palsy or epilepsy.

### Clinical Signs of Hydrocephalus in Neonates
- Vomiting, irritability, drowsiness, downward gaze, bulging fontanelles, and increased head circumference.
- A key indicator of raised ICP in neonates is a propensity for **apnoeic episodes**.
