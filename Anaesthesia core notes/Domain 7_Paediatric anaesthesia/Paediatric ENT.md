# Anaesthesia for Paediatric Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery

#### Adenotonsillectomy
- **Common procedure:** Over 25,000 performed annually in children under 15 in England.
- **Indications:**
	- Recurrent tonsillitis (â‰¥5 episodes/year).
	- Chronic tonsillitis.
	- Peritonsillar abscess.
	- Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
	- Enlarged adenoids causing nasal obstruction, OSA, or hearing loss.
**Preoperative Assessment:**
- Assess for OSA symptoms:
	- Heavy snoring, apneas, restless sleep.
	- Extended neck position during sleep, daytime hypersomnolence.
- Children with severe OSA at higher risk for perioperative complications: desaturation, laryngospasm, airway obstruction, increased sensitivity to sedatives/opioids.
- Overnight oximetry may help identify severe OSA.
**Airway Management:**
- **Tracheal Tube:**
	- Advantages: Definitive airway, good surgical access.
	- Disadvantages: Requires paralysis, risk of bronchial intubation/extubation, variable protection against soiling.
- **Reinforced LMA:**
	- Advantages: Avoids neuromuscular blockers, smooth emergence, airway protection until awake.
	- Disadvantages: Less definitive airway, may restrict surgical access.
**Analgesia:**
- Combination of paracetamol, NSAIDs, and small doses of opioids.
- Paracetamol and NSAIDs have morphine-sparing effects; avoid ketorolac.
- Dexamethasone (0.1-0.5 mg/kg) reduces analgesic needs.
**Prevention of PONV:**
- High incidence (~70%).
- Use multimodal approach:
	- Avoid nitrous oxide, provide balanced analgesia.
	- Prophylactic antiemetics (ondansetron, dexamethasone).
	- Adequate intraoperative fluid administration.
**Special Considerations for OSA:**
- Avoid sedative premedication and long-acting opioids.
- Prefer inhalation induction; consider small fentanyl dose for analgesia.
- Postoperative monitoring required, ICU care if needed.
**Day-Case Tonsillectomy:**
- Careful patient selection: age >3 years, no significant comorbidities or severe OSA.
- Extended observation period (4-6 hours) post-op.
**Bleeding Tonsil:**
- Preoperative resuscitation essential.
- Rapid sequence induction to protect against aspiration.
- Controlled ventilation for haemostasis.
#### Oesophagoscopy
- **Indications:** Removal of ingested foreign body.
- **Anaesthetic considerations:**
	- Shared airway, risk of aspiration, risk of oesophageal perforation.
	- Rapid sequence induction, secure tracheal tube on the left.
	- Maintain adequate depth of anesthesia and muscle relaxation.
#### Ear Surgery
**Common procedures:**
- Myringotomy, myringoplasty, tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy.
**Anaesthetic Considerations:**
- **Nitrous Oxide:**
	- Avoid N2O due to risk of increased middle ear pressure, graft displacement, worsened deafness, and increased PONV.
- **Bloodless Field:**
	- Head-up tilt, controlled hypotension, avoid tachycardia to minimize bleeding.
- **Facial Nerve Monitoring:**
	- Avoid neuromuscular blockers or use short-acting agents to allow nerve monitoring.
**PONV Management:**
- Use TIVA, antiemetics, and balanced analgesia to reduce PONV.
**Airway Management:**
- **Tracheal Tube:** Secure airway but risk of stormy emergence.
- **Reinforced LMA:** Smoother emergence but may restrict surgical access.
#### Bone-Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA)
- Surgical implantation of a titanium fixture in the mastoid bone.
- Associated congenital anomalies increase the risk of difficult intubation.
- Reinforced LMA often suitable, but fibreoptic intubation equipment should be available.
- Analgesia with paracetamol, NSAID, and small opioid dose. Routine antiemetics for high PONV risk.

# **Inhaled Foreign Body in Children: Key Considerations**

[Calgary-foreign body aspiration](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/Foreign-Body-Aspiration/)

#### **Case History**
- **Patient**: 17-month-old male, 13.5 kg
- **Presentation**: Shortness of breath after eating, history of sudden coughing
- **Examination**:
	- Distressed, intermittent coughing, no stridor
	- RR: 40 breaths/min, mild wheeze on right side
	- Oxygen saturations: 94% on room air
	- Chest X-ray: Clear, no pneumothorax, collapse, consolidation, or hyperinflation
#### **Aetiology, Incidence, and Prognosis**
- **Leading cause of death** in children from FB aspiration, causing 300 deaths annually in the USA
- **Most common age**: 1-3 years, boys more affected
- **Mortality**: Most deaths occur at the time of aspiration due to complete airway obstruction
- **Objects**: Food is the most common aspirated object, with **peanuts** accounting for 1/3 of all FB aspirations
#### **Presentation And Diagnosis**
- **Variability**: Dependent on time of presentation, size, and site of the FB
- **Common sites**: Over 90% lodge in the main bronchus, mostly on the right side
- **Early signs**: Range from severe airway obstruction to mild symptoms like coughing
- **Late signs**: Fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, focal chest signs (e.g., pneumonia)
- **History**:
	- **Choking episodes**: Sensitivity 81%, specificity 33%
	- **Persistent cough**: Sensitivity 78%, specificity 37%
- **Examination**:
	- **Signs of obstruction**: Cyanosis, stridor, intercostal recession
	- **Auscultation findings**: Abnormalities with 78% sensitivity
	- **Late presentation**: Features of pneumonia
- **Differential diagnosis**: Asthma, pneumothorax, croup, respiratory infections
#### **Special Investigations**
- **Chest X-ray**:
	- Sensitivity: 67-82%, specificity: 44-74%
	- Gas trapping, mediastinal shift, atelectasis, or lobar collapse may be seen
	- Normal X-ray possible in early stages, especially in organic FBs
#### **Management Strategy**
##### **Basic Life Support (BLS)**
- **Effective cough**: Encourage self-coughing
- **Ineffective cough**:
	- **Conscious child**: Administer 5 back blows, followed by 5 chest thrusts
	- **Unconscious child**: Airway management, ventilation, and chest compressions
##### **Subsequent Management**
- **Transfer to theatre**: Immediate bronchoscopy under general anaesthesia
- **Gold standard**: Rigid bronchoscopy for FB removal
- **Flexible bronchoscopy**: Occasionally used for diagnosis or FB removal
- **Key**: Communication between the medical team, ensuring preparedness with equipment and personnel
#### **Anaesthetic Management**
##### **Preparation**
1. **Fasting**: Preferable, but compromise may be needed
2. **Premedication**:
	- Care with sedatives to prevent FB dislodgement
	- Anticholinergics to prevent bradycardia and reduce airway secretions
3. **Medical therapy**: Avoid chest physiotherapy; consider antibiotics and steroids
4. **IV access**: Insert after induction if veins are difficult
##### **Induction**
- **Inhalational induction**: Sevoflurane or halothane; avoid nitrous oxide
- **Lignocaine spray**: 4 mg/kg to reduce the cardiovascular response to bronchoscopy
##### **Maintenance Of Anaesthesia**
- **Spontaneous ventilation technique**: Commonly used to avoid FB dislodgement
- **Ayre's T-piece**: Connected to bronchoscope for oxygenation and anaesthesia
- **Positive pressure ventilation**: Alternative technique, though controversial
#### **Perioperative Complications**
- **Airway**: Laryngeal oedema, complete airway obstruction, failure to remove FB
- **Breathing**: Hypoxia, hypercarbia, aspiration, pneumothorax
- **Circulation**: Cardiac dysrhythmias, arrest
- **Other**: Death, seizures from hypoxia
#### **Postoperative Care**
- **Chest X-ray**: To exclude pneumothorax or other complications
- **Discharge**: Often same-day if the child is clinically well
#### **Summary**
- FB aspiration is a common cause of death in children, requiring early intervention.
- Diagnosis depends on clinical suspicion and imaging.
- Anaesthesia for FB removal is challenging, with the spontaneous breathing technique commonly employed.
- Removal of the FB carries significant risk, particularly of airway obstruction during extraction.

# Anaesthesia for Paediatric ENT Update
### Preoperative Assessment for Paediatric ENT Procedures

#### Recent Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)

- **Higher Risk of Perioperative Respiratory Adverse Events (PRAE):** Oxygen desaturation, bronchospasm, cough, laryngospasm, airway obstruction.
- **Risk Peak:** Highest within 2 weeks of symptom resolution.
- **Recommendations:**
	- Postpone surgery by 2 weeks after systemic URTI symptoms (fever, wheezing).
	- If no systemic symptoms, proceed with surgery if benefits outweigh risks.
	- Use risk mitigation strategies: avoid airway instrumentation, use facemask/LMA, TIVA.

#### Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB)
##### Signs and Symptoms Suggestive of Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) in Children
**Night-time Symptoms**
- Snoring
- Apnoea
- Arousals or waking
- Restless sleep
- Night sweats
- Difficult to rouse in the morning
**Day-time Symptoms**
- Day-time sleepiness (rare in children with OSA*)
- Hyperactivity
- Poor concentration
- Lethargy
- Social withdrawal
- Poor school performance
**Signs**
- Obesity
- Tonsillar hypertrophy
- Mouth-breathing
- Failure to thrive
- Apnoea-hypopnoea index >2 events/h
- **Indication for Adenotonsillectomy:** OSA/SDB is the most common.
- **Complications of SDB/OSA:**
	- Increased PRAE risk (airway obstruction, desaturation).
	- Sensitivity to opioids.
	- Behavioral issues, systemic inflammation, nocturnal hypertension, cardiac sequelae.
- **Assessment:**
	- **High-risk features for PICU admission:** Age < 3 years, weight extremes, severe OSA, craniofacial abnormalities, significant comorbidities, hypotonia, cardiac disease.
	- Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for diagnosing OSA.
### High-risk Features for Postoperative Respiratory Complications in Children with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)

**High-risk Features**
- Age <3 years
- Weight <5th or >95th percentile
- Craniofacial abnormalities
- Severe OSA as measured on polysomnography (PSG)
- Cardiac disease
- Prematurity
- Hypotonia

**Suggested PICU Admission**
- Severe respiratory event in the operating room or PACU (e.g., laryngospasm)
- Oxygen saturation <90% on room air in the PACU
- Oxygen requirement in the PACU exceeding 40% FiO2 by facemask
- Age <24 months
- AHI >24
- Significant comorbidity:
	- Down syndrome
	- Pierre-Robin sequence
	- Neurodevelopmental or neuromuscular disease
#### Other Comorbidities
- **Considerations:** Congenital abnormalities (e.g., trisomy 21, craniofacial syndromes), coagulopathies (von Willebrand disease, hemophilia).
### Advances in Airway Surgery

#### Rigid Bronchoscopy

- **Purpose:** Diagnosis of tracheal/bronchial pathology or removal of a foreign body.
- **Procedure:**
	- A rigid ventilating bronchoscope is inserted through the vocal cords into the trachea.
	- The bronchoscope is a rigid metal tube with a removable optical telescope sealing the distal end.
	- Gas flows between the bronchoscope lumen and the telescopeâ€™s outer surface, with a port for attaching the anaesthetic circuit for oxygenation.
- **Anesthesia:**
	- TIVA (Total Intravenous Anaesthesia) technique with spontaneous ventilation.
	- Local anaesthetic applied to vocal cords and larynx to reduce anaesthetic requirements.
	- ENT surgeons may apply additional local anaesthetic to the distal trachea via the bronchoscope.
	- Controlled ventilation, including jet ventilation, can be used depending on expertise.
- **Key Consideration:** Calculating total local anaesthetic dosage by weight and coordinating usage between the anaesthesia and surgical teams.
#### Suspension Laryngoscopy

- **Purpose:** Surgical procedures on the larynx, including the epiglottis, vocal folds, and subglottis.
- **Developments:**
	- **Minimally invasive endoscopic techniques** (e.g., fibre-based lasers) are increasingly replacing traditional microscopes.
	- **Three-dimensional endoscopy** improves visualization, particularly of the distal trachea, through subglottic insertion.
	- Minimally invasive techniques reduce morbidity and potentially decrease the future need for open airway surgery.
- **Challenges:**
	- The presence of an endotracheal tube obstructs visualization of laryngeal structures in small pediatric airways.
	- **Spontaneous ventilation** is often used to maintain an unobstructed view.
	- Limited access to the patientâ€™s chest and lack of end-tidal CO2 monitoring require vigilant monitoring of the patientâ€™s condition.
	- **THRIVE (Trans-nasal Humidified Rapid Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange):** Used to improve oxygenation and surgical conditions during airway surgery. Flow rates of 2 L/kg/min with titratable FiO2 are used.
#### Anaesthetic Challenges

- Maintaining adequate depth of anaesthesia while avoiding:
	- Apnoea.
	- Hypoxemia.
	- Hypercapnia.
- Without using endotracheal intubation, the anaesthetic team observes the surgical field on shared image display screens to monitor the patientâ€™s condition.
#### Advantages and Limitations of Trans-nasal Humidified Oxygenation and Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE) in Paediatric ENT Surgery
**Advantages**
- Uninterrupted oxygenation from induction of anaesthesia
- Unobstructed surgical field
- Titratable oxygen/air mixture
- Provides CPAP
- Well tolerated and can be used pre-induction and for postoperative support
- Easy to use
- Transportable
**Limitations**
- Optimum use requires experience with TIVA
- Difficulty monitoring ETCO2
- Transcutaneous monitoring can be required
- Role of CO2 clearance requires further study
- Rigid bronchoscope in very young infants may potentially obstruct adequate gas flow
### Anesthetic Considerations for Common ENT Procedures

#### Myringotomy and Tympanostomy Tubes

- **Preoperative:**
	- Analgesia: Oral acetaminophen Â± NSAID.
	- Address recent URTI.
- **Intraoperative:**
	- Facemask or LMA, spontaneous ventilation.
	- Consider ondansetron for anti-emesis, small dose of intraoperative opioid.
- **Postoperative:**
	- Analgesic needs variable, IV opioids rarely needed.
#### Adenotonsillectomy (T&A)

- **Preoperative:**
	- Assess OSA severity, premedicate with acetaminophen and NSAID, consider dexmedetomidine to reduce opioid need.
- **Intraoperative:**
	- Oral RAE tube or flexible LMA.
	- Use TIVA to reduce PONV.
	- Encourage topicalization of tonsillar bed with local anesthetic.
- **Postoperative:**
	- Multimodal analgesia with oral morphine, dexamethasone, ondansetron for PONV.
	- Closer monitoring required in high-risk patients.
![[Tonsillectomy.pdf]]

#### Removal of Inhaled Foreign Body

- **Preoperative:**
	- Confirm diagnosis, chest X-ray to assess obstruction.
- **Intraoperative:**
	- TIVA with propofol/remifentanil, vocal cords topicalized with lidocaine.
- **Postoperative:**
	- Monitor for complications like desaturation, bleeding, laryngospasm, pneumothorax.
#### Laser Surgery of the Larynx

- **Preoperative:**
	- Assess airway anatomy, surgical/radiological input.
- **Intraoperative:**
	- Surgeon present before induction, TIVA, avoid non-laser-resistant endotracheal tubes.
- **Postoperative:**
	- Minimal bleeding and edema, airway obstruction usually improves.
#### Major Ear Surgery

- **Preoperative:**
	- Premedicate with acetaminophen Â± NSAID, assess for bleeding diatheses and PONV risks.
	- Obtain an ECG in children with congenital hearing defects to exclude long QT syndrome that comprises part of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.
- **Intraoperative:**
	- TIVA to reduce PONV, avoid hypertension/hypercarbia, dual antiemetic prophylaxis.
- **Postoperative:**
	- Pain and PONV common, manage preemptively.
#### Endoscopic Sinus Surgery

- **Intraoperative:**
	- Airway distant from anaesthetist
	- Optimize physiology to minimize bleeding, use throat packs (ensure removal post-procedure).
