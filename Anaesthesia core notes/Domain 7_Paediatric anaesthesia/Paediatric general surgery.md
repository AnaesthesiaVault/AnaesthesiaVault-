# Anaesthesia and Laparoscopic Surgery in Children

#### Introduction
- Laparoscopic surgery is considered a major advance over traditional open surgery.
- **Benefits:**
	- Avoids large incisions, less fluid and heat loss, better cosmetic results.
	- Quicker recovery, earlier mobilization, reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, fewer complications.
- However, it introduces **physiological derangements** not seen in open surgery, requiring anaesthetic strategies to manage these issues.
### Surgical Technique
- Laparoscopy requires insufflation of gas (usually CO₂) to create a working area within the peritoneal cavity, increasing intra-abdominal pressure (IAP).
- **Methods of Insufflation:**
	- **Closed method:** Using a Verres needle.
	- **Open technique:** Preferred in small children to reduce the risk of perforating abdominal viscera or vessels.
- **Potential complications:**
	- Subcutaneous emphysema, embolization, intra-abdominal perforation, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum.
	- CO₂ retention post-surgery can cause diaphragmatic splinting, hypercarbia, and vomiting.
- Surgical access may require steep head-up/down and lateral positions, impacting cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
### Physiological Effects of Laparoscopic Surgery

**Respiratory System:**
- Pneumoperitoneum causes a cephalad shift of the diaphragm, reducing functional residual capacity (FRC), thoracic compliance, and increasing airway resistance.
- **Consequences:**
	- Decreased oxygenation, increased dead space to tidal volume ratio, risk of hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis.
**Cardiovascular System:**
- Increased afterload and decreased cardiac output due to catecholamine and vasopressin release.
- Low IAP can increase venous return (autotransfusion), but high IAP impedes venous return, reducing cardiac output.
- Head-up position reduces cardiac output, while head-down improves venous return.
**Fluid Balance:**
- Laparoscopic surgery has lower fluid losses compared to open procedures, reducing the risk of fluid overload.
- Raised IAP may reduce urine output, though permanent renal impairment is rare.
**Temperature:**
- Less heat loss occurs, but **hypothermia** remains a risk.

**Intracranial Pressure (ICP):**
- Increases in ICP have been observed, especially in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts.
- Hypercapnia and raised IAP contribute to elevated ICP, which combined with reduced cardiac output, may impair cerebral perfusion.
### Physiological Effects of Laparoscopic Surgery in Children

- **Neonates and infants** (under 4 months):
	- Vulnerable to bradycardia and respiratory complications.
	- IAP > 15 mmHg can impair cardiac output due to decreased left ventricular contractility.
	- IAP of no more than **6 mmHg** is recommended to avoid complications like right-to-left shunting.
- **Children over 4 months:**
	- Similar physiological effects to adults as long as IAP is kept below 15 mmHg.
- **Adverse intraoperative events:**
	- High end-tidal CO₂, blood pressure fluctuations, hypoxia.
### Laparoscopic Procedures in Children

**Appendicectomy:**
- **Advantages:** Simultaneous diagnostic and therapeutic capability, reduced analgesia, shorter hospital stay, quicker recovery.
- **Complication rates:**
	- Post-op complications 1.5%, with 0.7% requiring reoperation.
	- Higher incidence of major complications than open surgery, but fewer minor complications.
**Splenectomy:**
- **Advantages:** Shorter hospital stay, reduced postoperative analgesia.
- **Disadvantages:** Longer operating time, increased pulmonary complications.
**Fundoplication:**
- **Benefits:** Reduced postoperative morbidity.
- **Complications:** Significant cardiovascular changes (hypotension, hypertension) in >50% of cases, minor respiratory issues like hypercarbia and hypoxia.
**Pyloromyotomy:**
- **Advantages:** Less postoperative pain and scarring.
- **Disadvantages:** Potentially longer procedure with higher risk of complications like mucosal perforation.
### Anaesthetic Technique

- **Preoperative preparation:** Assess and prepare patients.
- **Premedication:** Use sedatives and anticholinergics as needed.
- **Induction:** IV or inhalational agents; avoid nitrous oxide.
- **Muscle relaxants:** Neuromuscular blockade is necessary for surgical access.
- **Ventilation:** Controlled ventilation to maintain normocarbia; adjust tidal volume and respiratory rate.
- **Monitoring:** Invasive monitoring (e.g., arterial line, central venous access) may be required.
- **Postoperative analgesia:** Multimodal approach, including local anaesthetic infiltration by the surgeon.
### Conclusions

- Laparoscopic surgery in children is widely adopted but still evolving compared to open surgery.
- **Challenges:**
	- Prolonged learning curve for surgeons and the potential for rare but severe complications.
- **Anaesthetic Role:**
	- The anaesthetist is crucial in managing the physiological challenges associated with laparoscopic procedures in children.
# Paediatric Trauma

#### Epidemiology and Injury Mechanisms

- **>80%** of injuries in children are caused by blunt trauma (UK data).
- Most seriously injured children have multiple injuries.
- **Head injury** is present in the majority of cases and accounts for **75% of deaths**.
- **Injury mechanisms by age:**
	- **Infants:** Non-accidental injury (NAI) is most common.
	- **Toddlers:** Falls are the predominant injury mechanism.
	- **Older children/adolescents:** Road traffic accidents (RTAs) and sports injuries are common.
- **RTAs:**
	- > 50% of cases involve children as pedestrians.
		
	- 20% involve children as cyclists.
### Paediatric Trauma Mortality

- **Trimodal distribution of deaths:**
	- **50%** die at the scene from severe head injury or major hemorrhage.
	- **30%** die within the first few hours from head injury, hemorrhage, or airway emergencies.
	- **Late deaths** are due to organ failure or sepsis, often caused by inadequate resuscitation.
- Up to **30%** of deaths are preventable through rapid problem identification and early aggressive treatment.
### Systematic Approach to Paediatric Trauma

- **Key components for survival:**
	- Good prehospital care.
	- Appropriate triage.
	- Effective resuscitation.
- **Structured management approach:**
	1. Primary survey
	2. Initial resuscitation
	3. Secondary survey
	4. Emergency treatment
	5. Definitive care
### Primary Survey and Resuscitation

#### Airway
- Ensure a **patent airway**; consider:
	- Cervical spinal injury.
	- Head injury.
	- Full stomach.
- **Children** are more prone to airway obstruction due to anatomical differences (larger head, smaller mid-face).
- **Cervical spine injury:** Uncommon (<2% of cases), compared to **traumatic brain injury** (75% of cases).
- **Orotracheal intubation** is preferred over nasal intubation.
- **Indications for intubation:**
	- Respiratory inadequacy.
	- GCS < 8.
	- Suspected raised intracranial pressure.
	- Need for prolonged ventilation or transport.
#### Breathing
- Rapid assessment of breathing and ventilation is essential.
- Children are more prone to **airway collapse** and **hypoxia** due to increased respiratory rate, smaller functional residual capacity, and increased chest wall compliance.
- Urgent intervention may be needed for:
	- **Tension pneumothorax**.
	- **Open pneumothorax**.
	- **Hemothorax**.
	- **Flail chest**.
#### Circulation
- Assess heart rate, capillary refill, skin color, blood pressure, and mental status.
- **Children compensate** well after major hemorrhage through vasoconstriction, but hypotension is a **late sign** of hypovolemia.
	- Tachycardia is a more reliable indicator of hypovolemia than hypotension.
	- A child can lose >40% of blood volume before hypotension occurs.
- **Intravenous access:** Often easier in hands/feet than antecubital fossa.
	- If IV access cannot be obtained in **90 seconds**, intraosseous access is appropriate.
- **Fluid resuscitation:**
	- Warm isotonic crystalloid (Ringer’s lactate or saline) in **20 ml/kg boluses**.
	- If no improvement after >40 ml/kg, administer **10 ml/kg blood** boluses.
	- **Permissive hypotension** (SBP ~80 mmHg) may be appropriate in uncontrolled hemorrhage.
#### Disability
- Assess consciousness using the **AVPU score**.
- Identify severe head injury requiring neurosurgical care.
- Administer **analgesia** (e.g., morphine 0.1-0.2 mg/kg).
#### Investigations
- **X-rays:** Chest, pelvis, C-spine.
- **Labs:** ABG, FBC, crossmatch, glucose, U&Es.
- **Urinary catheter** if required.
- Gather a detailed history of the accident and medical background.
### Secondary Survey and Emergency Treatment

#### Head and Neck
- Assess for **bruising, lacerations, fractures**, and **CSF leak**.
- Perform a **neurological assessment** (GCS, pupillary reflexes, fundoscopy).
- **Retinal hemorrhages** suggest NAI (non-accidental injury).
- **Indications for brain CT:** GCS <12, LOC, skull fracture, neurological signs, or severe injury.
- **Refer to neurosurgery** for focal neurology, worsening signs, increased ICP, abnormal CT, or penetrating injuries.
- **Osmolar therapy** (mannitol, hypertonic saline) for mass lesions or impending herniation.
#### Spinal Injuries
- Spinal cord injuries are **rare** in children (<2% of trauma).
- Cartilaginous vertebral bodies and elastic ligaments protect the spine.
- Young children are more likely to suffer **high cervical injuries** (C1-C3).
- Assume spinal injury until cleared.
- **SCIWORA** (spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality) is common.
#### Chest Trauma
- Thoracic injuries occur in ~3% of blunt trauma cases.
- Common injuries: **Pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion**.
- **Rib fractures** are markers of severe trauma.
- Use **chest CT** if injury extent is unclear.
#### Abdominal Trauma
- Accounts for ~10% of pediatric trauma and is the **second leading cause** of preventable death.
- Vulnerable organs: **Liver, spleen, bladder**.
- Physical exam detects **97%** of injuries; **CT scan** is the diagnostic tool of choice.
- **90%** of cases managed non-operatively.
- **Indications for laparotomy:** Hemodynamic instability, peritonitis, pneumoperitoneum, renal vascular injury.
#### Limb Injuries
- **Skeletal injury** occurs in 10-15% of pediatric trauma.
- **Single, closed long bone fractures** can cause significant blood loss.
- **Open fractures** cause double the blood loss of closed fractures.
#### Non-Accidental Injury (NAI)
- **Most common cause of head injury** in infants.
- Associated injuries: **Subdural hemorrhage, femur fracture, bruising, burns**.
- **Referral to pediatric specialists** is essential in suspicious cases.
### Definitive Care

- Stabilized child should be transferred to a **paediatric intensive care unit (PICU)**.
- Early referral to regional PICU allows for coordinated transport and advice.
- **Significant head injuries** should be referred early to the regional neurosurgical unit.
	- **Surgical evacuation** of significant hematomas should occur within 4 hours.
- Ensure availability of **appropriate drugs, equipment, and experienced staff** for emergency transfer.
- Provide **family support** during care and transfer.
# Anaesthesia for Children Having Endoscopy

#### Common Pathologies

**Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease (Gourd):**
- Common in childhood, usually resolving by age 1.
- Can become pathological if associated with troublesome symptoms or complications.
- Caused by transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation or mechanical factors (e.g., hiatus hernia, dysmotility).
- Diagnosis through clinical signs or endoscopy with pH monitoring and biopsies if medical therapy fails.
- Treatment: dietary advice, medical therapy, fundoplication surgery in selected cases.

**Coeliac Disease:**
- Autoimmune condition triggered by gluten, affecting 1% of the UK population.
- Symptoms: chronic diarrhea, abdominal distension, failure to thrive, and nutritional deficiencies.
- Diagnosis: positive serology and confirmatory biopsy.
- Long-term complications (if untreated): osteoporosis, infertility, malignancy.
- Severe cases may present as a 'coeliac crisis' with diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbance.

**Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD):**
- Includes **Crohn's disease** and **ulcerative colitis**.
- Up to 25% of cases present in childhood.
- Crohn's: affects any part of the GI tract; patchy involvement.
- Ulcerative colitis: primarily affects the large bowel.
- Diagnosis: combined oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy with biopsies.
- Treatment: nutritional therapy, anti-inflammatories, immunosuppressants, biological agents, surgery in severe cases.

**Dysmotility Disorders:**
- Includes Gourd, chronic constipation, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO).
- Constipation is common and may have a behavioral component.
- Diagnosis of neuropathic disorders (e.g., Hirschsprung's disease) through colonic/anorectal manometry.
- Treatment: behavioral modifications, laxatives, botulinum injections, surgery.
- CIPO may require long-term parenteral nutrition or intestinal transplantation.
### Endoscopy-Related Procedures

**Bowel Preparation:**
- Required for lower GI procedures.
- Standard preparation: low-fiber/liquid diet with senna, sodium picosulfate, magnesium citrate.
- Severe constipation may need extended preparation (e.g., Klean-Prep).

**Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) Insertion:**
- Indicated for patients dependent on nasogastric tubes (e.g., failure to thrive, neurological impairment).
- Involves transillumination, finger indentation, and insertion of a gastrostomy tube.
- Prophylactic antibiotics and tracheal intubation are recommended.

**Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE):**
- Imaging of the entire GI tract, especially the small intestine.
- Indications: IBD, protein-losing enteropathies, obscure GI bleeding, small bowel polyps/tumors.
- Capsule is swallowed or endoscopically placed into the duodenum, transmitting images over 24-48 hours.

**Balloon Enteroscopy:**
- Visualization and intervention in the small bowel after abnormal VCE findings.
- Uses a balloon to progressively move through the small bowel.
- Can last up to 3 hours with complications like perforation, pancreatitis, and bleeding.

**Anorectal Manometry:**
- Assesses rectal and anal sphincter function.
- Ideally performed awake as anesthesia interferes with results.

**Suction Rectal Biopsy:**
- Diagnostic for Hirschsprung’s disease (absence of ganglia).
- Some self-limiting bleeding expected after biopsy.

**Colonic Manometry:**
- Measures intraluminal pressures to evaluate colonic neuromuscular function.
- Avoid opioids (other than ultrashort-acting ones) as they disrupt colonic motility.
### Anaesthetic Considerations

**Anaesthetic Assessment:**
- Full history and examination focusing on:
	- Nutritional status, reflux symptoms, current medications.
	- Risk of aspiration, electrolyte disturbances, neutropenia.
- Appropriate investigations (e.g., blood tests) for high-risk patients.

**Anaesthetic Techniques:**
1. **IV Sedation:**
	- Commonly used but higher risk of complications vs general anesthesia.
	- Midazolam and opioids require more restraint and can lead to procedure abandonment.
	- Propofol-based TIVA is preferred over midazolam-based sedation.
2. **Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA):**
	- Allows endoscopy with LMA in situ, though smaller sizes are often needed.
	- Specialized LMAs with a channel for the endoscope exist but are not licensed for children.
3. **Native Airway Technique:**
	- TIVA with propofol and/or opioid adjuncts, maintaining spontaneous ventilation.
	- Risks include apnea and laryngospasm, requiring close coordination with the endoscopist.
	- Lower risk of nausea, vomiting, and emergence delirium.
4. **Tracheal Intubation:**
	- Indicated for patients <10 kg, with airway issues, significant comorbidities, or certain procedures.
	- Can be done without neuromuscular blockers using propofol, alfentanil, or remifentanil.
	- Avoids prolonged neuromuscular blockade and facilitates early extubation.
### Postprocedure

- Residual intraluminal gas can cause diaphragmatic splinting, especially in infants, small children, or those with respiratory/cardiac disease.
	- Tracheal intubation and gentle abdominal pressure may help expel gas before extubation.
- Significant postoperative pain should be evaluated to exclude bowel perforation.
# Anaesthesia for Children with Liver Disease

#### Chronic Liver Disease
**Key Characteristics:**
- **Cirrhosis**
- **Portal hypertension** with ascites, splenomegaly, varices.
**Mechanical Effects:**
- **Ascites:**
	- Diaphragmatic splinting, reduced functional residual capacity, increased work of breathing, hypoxemia.
	- Risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
- **Splenomegaly:**
	- Causes pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia often appears first.
- **Varices:**
	- High portal pressures open collateral vessels, leading to variceal bleeding.
	- Varices may cause uncontrollable bleeding during surgery.
- **TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt):**
	- Lowers portal pressures but can precipitate encephalopathy.
**Coagulopathy:**
- Liver synthesizes most clotting factors (except factor VIII).
- **Vitamin K-dependent factors** (II, VII, IX, X) affected by biliary obstruction.
- Coagulopathy from hepatocellular failure is difficult to correct; avoid overcorrection to prevent fluid overload.
**Drug Metabolism:**
- Altered fluid compartments and protein binding affect drug distribution and clearance.
- **Phase 1** and **conjugation reactions** may be impaired.
- Enhanced and prolonged effects of sedative drugs.
**Haemodynamic Effects:**
- **High-output, low-resistance circulation**.
- Pulmonary hypertension may complicate management.
**Respiratory System:**
- **Ascites and pleural effusions** reduce respiratory reserve.
- **Hepatopulmonary syndrome:** Intrapulmonary vascular dilatations cause hypoxemia, often improved by lying flat.
**Renal Impairment:**
- Acute renal impairment common, often due to dehydration.
- Careful fluid management is essential.
**Encephalopathy:**
- Decreased consciousness due to **hyperammonemia**, raised intracranial pressure, and neuroinflammation.
- Early signs may be subtle, especially in young children.
**Other Considerations:**
- **Electrolyte disturbances** (especially hyponatremia).
- **Nutritional deficiencies**, including vitamin D deficiency.
- **Intractable pruritus.**
#### Acute Liver Failure
- Defined by rapid onset of **encephalopathy** (<8 weeks).
- Enhanced sensitivity to anesthetic/sedative agents, prolonged recovery.
- **Impaired glucose regulation** requires continuous IV glucose support.
- **Hyperdynamic circulation** with low systemic vascular resistance.
- High risk of **cerebral edema**, circulatory/multi-organ failure, and sepsis.
### Anaesthetic Management
**General Principles:**
- Transfer to specialist centers is recommended for advanced liver disease.
- **Volatile anesthetics** (isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane) are acceptable.
- Preferred muscle relaxants: **atracurium**, **remifentanil**, and **cisatracurium**.
- Adequate analgesia is important, even with concerns about opioids.
### Anaesthetic Considerations for Specific Procedures
**Minor Procedures:**
- Assess respiratory impairment from ascites, organomegaly, or effusions.
- Maintain IV fluids to prevent dehydration and hypoglycemia.
- Secure airway with tracheal tube, avoid spontaneous ventilation.
**Intermediate Procedures:**
- Tracheal intubation and maintain normothermia, normovolemia.
- Postoperative care may require higher levels of support.
- Consider **central venous access** for volume optimization.
**Major Procedures:**
- Full invasive monitoring, optimize hemodynamics to preserve organ perfusion.
- Monitor coagulation with **INR** and **thromboelastography**.
- Postoperative intensive care may be required, particularly with opioid analgesia.
- **Peripheral nerve blocks** preferred over neuraxial techniques due to coagulopathy.
### Specific Liver-Related Procedures

**Biliary Atresia & Kasai Portoenterostomy:**
- Challenges: Fluid loss, venous drainage interruption, and analgesia.
- Coagulopathy unlikely if given vitamin K.
- Outcomes: 1/3 successful, 1/3 partial success, 1/3 require early transplant.
**Choledochal Cysts:**
- Similar anesthetic management to biliary atresia.
**Cholelithiasis:**
- Management similar to adults (laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy).
**Liver Tumors:**
- Challenges: Hemorrhage, air embolism, post-resection liver insufficiency.
- Large-bore central venous access and rapid infusion devices required.
- **Cell salvage** controversial due to risk of tumor cell dissemination.
**Liver Transplantation:**
- 3 phases: **dissection, anhepatic, reperfusion**.
- Key concerns: Bleeding, electrolyte/acid-base disturbances, hemodynamic instability.
- **5-year survival** rate ~90% for chronic indications.
