### The Evolution of Paediatric Laryngoscopes and Intubation Aids
#### Early History of Intubation
- The first anaesthetic given to a child predates the first reported use of ether in 1846 by Morton (1).
- Oral and nasal intubation of the apparently drowned was described by Kite of Gravesend in 1788 (2).
- The first oral tracheal intubation was performed in an awake adult with diphtheria by surgeon William Macewen in 1878 using his fingers as a guide (3).
- Tracheal intubation was rarely performed in children before the 1940s (1).
#### Indirect Visualisation of the Larynx
- The first person to indirectly view the larynx was singing instructor Manuel Garcia, who devised a speculum and mirrors to view the larynx in action in 1855 (3).
- Alfred Kirstein in Berlin performed the first direct laryngoscopy in an adult with his 'autoscope' in 1895, 40 years later (4).
#### Developments in Paediatric Intubation
- Sir Ivan Magill recognized the need for intubation in infants undergoing surgery for harelip and cleft palate after his experiences providing insufflation anaesthesia via narrow gum-elastic tubes using a laryngoscope for adults with face and jaw injuries (5,6,7).
- Gillespie invented the Shadwell laryngoscope, a modification of the Chevalier Jackson laryngoscope, in 1936 (8).
- Macintosh described his curved adult laryngoscope in 1943, which was better suited for older children (9,10,11).
- Miller described a modification of his adult laryngoscope for children in 1946 (12).
#### Factors Driving the Proliferation of Paediatric Laryngoscopes
1. **Introduction of neuromuscular blocking agents** in the 1940s, allowing intubation in a lighter plane of anaesthesia (13,14).
2. **Development of polyvinyl chloride tracheal tubes** in the 1960s, allowing production of less reactive tubes (15).
3. **Advances in managing respiratory failure in premature infants** during the 1960s demonstrated that intubation improved survival (16).
#### Straight vs. Curved Blades
- **Straight blades** are superior in elevating the tongue and facilitating visualisation of the infant larynx compared to curved blades (21-23).
- Straight blades allow direct elevation of the epiglottis, while curved blades lift the epiglottis indirectly (24).
- The **Miller laryngoscope** (with a narrow C-shaped channel) can have its view obstructed by the tracheal tube (25,26).
- The **Cardiff pediatric laryngoscope** combines elements of both curved and straight blades to create a "universal" blade (27).
#### The Present Day
- Over 50 devices for laryngoscopy have been invented or modified since the larynx was first visualized (34).
- Many new devices allow **indirect visualization of the larynx** using rigid optical stylets or flexible fiber-optic scopes (36-40).
- **Video-laryngoscopy** and **video-intuboscopy** provide an image from the tip of the laryngoscope or tracheal tube during conventional direct laryngoscopy (39-44).
- **Lighting is crucial**, and LED light sources are becoming more common, providing a "cooler" and more appropriate spectrum of light (45-49).
#### Disposability and Standards
- **Disposable laryngoscope blades** are becoming more common, but there are concerns about loss of fidelity and accuracy compared to the original designs (50-58).
- There are currently no standards set for laryngoscope blades, but the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** has published a draft standard for flexibility and light output (56).
- "Currently there are no standards set for laryngoscope blades with respect to strength, flexibility and light output."

### Perioperative Respiratory Adverse Events (PRAE) in Infants: Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) vs. Endotracheal Tube (ETT)
#### Study Overview
- This study examined the differences in perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAE) between the use of laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) and endotracheal tubes (ETTs) in infants undergoing minor elective surgery.
- **PRAE** are the most common critical incidents in pediatric anesthesia, occurring more frequently in infants.
- **LMAs** are associated with reduced PRAE compared to ETTs in older children (>1 year).
- This was the first **randomized controlled trial** comparing LMAs and ETTs in infants for PRAE incidence.
#### Methods
- **Design:** Randomized controlled trial conducted at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Australia.
- **Participants:**
	- Infants aged 0-12 months undergoing minor elective surgery with anticipated fentanyl dose ≤1 μg/kg.
	- Excluded: Infants with contraindications to LMA or ETT, known cardiac/airway/thoracic malformations, those receiving midazolam premedication, or undergoing airway/thoracic/abdominal surgery.
- **Intervention:** Infants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either an LMA or an ETT.
- **Outcomes:**
	- **Primary outcome:** Incidence of any PRAE.
	- **Secondary outcomes:** Incidence of individual PRAE and timing (intraoperative vs. postoperative).
#### Results
- **Total enrollment:** 181 infants, with 177 included in the intention-to-treat analysis (83 in LMA group, 94 in ETT group).
- **Overall PRAE incidence:**
	- PRAE occurred in 50 infants (53%) in the ETT group vs. 15 infants (18%) in the LMA group (Relative Risk [RR] 2.94, p<0.0001).
- **Major PRAE (laryngospasm, bronchospasm):**
	- Major PRAE occurred in 18 infants (19%) in the ETT group vs. 3 infants (4%) in the LMA group (RR 5.30, p=0.002).
- **Timing of PRAE:**
	- PRAE occurred more frequently intraoperatively in both groups.
- **Conclusion:**
	- In infants undergoing minor elective procedures, **LMAs were associated with significantly fewer PRAE** and a lower occurrence of major PRAE (laryngospasm, bronchospasm) compared to ETTs (Drake-Brockman et al., 2017).
#### Discussion
- **LMAs** were associated with significantly lower incidence of overall, major, and minor PRAE compared to ETTs in infants.
- **Endotracheal tubes** may cause increased mechanical stimulation and airway inflammation, contributing to the higher rate of PRAE.
- The results suggest that **LMAs should be considered over ETTs** for airway management in suitable infants undergoing minor elective procedures.
#### Key Takeaways
- LMAs were associated with a lower incidence of PRAE compared to ETTs in infants.
- Major PRAE such as laryngospasm and bronchospasm were **5 times more common** with ETTs.
- Airway device selection should consider the risk of PRAE, which are a major contributor to anesthetic morbidity in infants (Drake-Brockman et al., 2017).
