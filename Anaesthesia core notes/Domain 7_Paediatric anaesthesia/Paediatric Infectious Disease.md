# Anaesthesia in HIV-infected Children

### Introduction

- **Discovery and Early Reports**:
	- HIV discovered in the 1980s.
	- First AIDS reports in adults (1981) and children (1982) in the USA (1,2).
- **Virus Classification**:
	- Retrovirus family; lentivirus subfamily.
	- Two subtypes: HIV-1 and HIV-2 recovered from AIDS patients.
- **Pathogenesis and Advances**:
	- Pathogenesis of HIV infection well-described (3,4).
	- Decline in AIDS deaths and increase in people living with HIV due to advances in understanding and antiretroviral therapy (5).
- **Surgical Relevance**:
	- 20–25% of HIV-positive patients will require surgery (6).
	- Anesthesiologists will care for HIV-positive patients, facing a range of disease severity.
- **Article Focus**:
	- Reviews anesthesia implications of pediatric HIV infection, emphasizing clinical manifestations and medications.

### HIV/AIDS Epidemic

- **Global Statistics (2005)**:
	- Summary of people infected and deaths from HIV (5).

### HIV-Positive Children

- **Transmission**:
	- Most common mode: mother-to-infant vertical transmission.
	- Occurs in utero (transplacental), intrapartum (during labor and delivery), and postpartum (breastfeeding).
- **Risk Factors**:
	- Advanced stage of maternal disease.
	- Premature delivery (<37 weeks).
	- Nonreceipt of zidovudine (ZDV).
	- High maternal viral load.
	- Low maternal CD4+ T-lymphocyte count.
	- Membrane rupture >4 hours.
	- Chorioamnionitis.
	- Nonreceipt of cesarean section before labor onset.
- **Adolescents and Adults Transmission**:
	- Common routes: i.v. drug abuse and sexually transmitted infection.
	- Includes sexual abuse (7).
- **Rare Transmission Modes**:
	- Household contact (skin or mucous membrane exposure to HIV-infected blood).
	- Home care workers (percutaneous or cutaneous exposure to blood or contaminated needles) (8–10).
	- Emphasis on proper infection-control practices.
	- No need to restrict placement of HIV-infected children (10).
- **Prevention Measures**:
	- Dramatic reduction in HIV infection in children due to effective perinatal transmission prevention.
	- Measures include:
		- HIV screening in mothers during prenatal care.
		- Reducing viral load in mothers via short-course ZDV or other antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis.
		- Reducing fetal exposure at delivery.
		- Neonatal antiretroviral prophylaxis.
		- Avoidance of breastfeeding to prevent postpartum exposure (7).
### Diagnosis of Pediatric HIV Infection

- **Complications**:
	- Rapid and early diagnosis complicated by transplacental passage of maternal IgG antibodies (11).
	- Virtually all exposed infants are HIV-antibody positive at birth; only 15–30% are actually infected.
	- Maternal antibodies usually undetectable by 9 months, occasionally up to 18 months.
	- Standard anti-HIV IgG tests reliable for children older than 12–18 months.
- **Virologic Assays for Infants <18 Months**:
	- HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
	- HIV peripheral blood lymphocyte culture.
	- HIV p24 antigen (major internal core protein of the virus).
	- HIV DNA PCR can identify 30–50% of infected infants at birth and nearly 100% by 3–6 months.
	- Virologic assays confirm infection in advanced disease with inadequate antibody production.
	- Postnatal infections in infants >18 months can be diagnosed by serology alone.
- **Definitions**:
	- **Perinatally Exposed**: Seropositive by enzyme immunoassays and confirmatory test (Western blot or immunofluorescent), or born to an HIV-infected mother with unknown antibody status.
	- **Seroeverter**: Born to an HIV-infected mother, HIV-antibody negative after 6 months, no other laboratory evidence of HIV infection, and no AIDS surveillance case definition criteria (12).

### Classification of Pediatric HIV Infection

- **1994 CDC Revised Classification**:
	- Classification based on immunologic and clinical status.
	- Once classified, cannot be reclassified to a less severe category.

![[34AA7B90-7CFF-4DD3-91C3-95DEA84FD9A8.jpeg]]

- **Immunologic Categories**:
	- CD4+ T-lymphocyte depletion is a major consequence.
	- CD4+ counts used to classify immunosuppression severity.
	- Normal CD4+ counts higher in infants and young children; decline with age.
	- Age-specific CD4+ counts and percentages used for classification.
	- Three immunologic categories.

![[90792ABC-F853-4788-B7B9-F7524D966629_4_5005_c.jpeg]]

- **Clinical Categories**:
	- Categories: N, A, B, and C.
	- Based on signs, symptoms, or diagnoses related to HIV infection.
![[2C799977-8031-4397-84D9-997D1ABE6DC8 1.jpeg]]
### Preanesthesia Assessment

**General Considerations**

- Include organ system involvement, consequences of antiretroviral therapy (side effects, drug interactions), and presence of opportunistic infections.

**Organ System Involvement**

- Related to HIV infection (CDC clinical categories) or medication side effects (13,14).
- Discussed organ systems with anesthesia implications.

![[60DB467E-EC3A-4EDD-BEA6-7ED19B16F07B.jpeg]]

**Growth and Nutrition**

- Common issues: growth delay, nutritional deficiency.
- Treatments: high-calorie formula, i.v. hyperalimentation.
- Risks: hypoglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, weight loss, wasting syndrome.

**Cardiovascular Involvement**

- Affects any cardiovascular component; pathogenesis uncertain.
- Contributing factors: primary HIV, secondary infections, concurrent diseases, therapy side effects, nutritional deficiencies, immune-mediated mechanisms.
- Manifestations: asymptomatic to fatal; severity correlates with immune suppression.
- Cardiomyopathy impacts survival; treated with early detection, pharmacologic treatment, HAART, adjunctive therapies (i.v. immunoglobulin, steroids).
- HAART complications: hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, lipodystrophy, insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus.

**Respiratory Involvement**

- Upper/lower airway involvement: adenotonsillar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement.
- Risks: frequent upper respiratory infections, significant lower respiratory infections (tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, Pneumocystis carinii, respiratory syncytial virus).
- Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis/pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia (LIP/PLH): chronic lymphocytic infiltrative disease with cough, tachypnea, oxygen desaturation; diagnosed clinically and with chest X-ray.

**Hematologic Involvement**

- Common manifestations: anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia.
- Severe thrombocytopenia and anemia indicate advanced disease and poor prognosis.
- Causes: immune-mediated peripheral destruction, bone marrow suppression (medications), HIV replication, nutritional deficiencies, chronic illness.

**Gastrointestinal Involvement**

- Frequent diarrhea; pathogens can be parasitic, bacterial, fungal, viral.
- Consequences: malnutrition, growth failure, impaired lymphocyte function.
- Other manifestations: nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, dysphagia, odynophagia.
- Common infections: Candida, Herpes simplex, Cytomegalovirus.

**Hepatic Involvement**

- Common hepatosplenomegaly; severe hepatocellular dysfunction is uncommon.
- Causes: HIV replication in reticuloendothelial system, drug-induced hepatocellular injury, infectious agents.

**Renal Involvement**

- Ranges from mild-to-moderate proteinuria, hematuria, renal tubular acidosis to end-stage renal disease.
- Treatment: modification of medications, avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, possible dialysis.

**Neurologic Involvement**

- HIV can affect the CNS at any disease stage.
- Severe cases: encephalopathy, opportunistic infections; slower progression in other cases.
- Presentations: meningitis, progressive encephalopathy, vasculitis, CNS tumors, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy.

**Antiretroviral Therapy of HIV Infection**

- Four major classes: NRTIs, NtRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, fusion inhibitors (21,22).
- HAART: combination therapy, enhances survival, reduces opportunistic infections and complications (23).
- Adverse effects of concern to anesthesiologists: lactic acidosis, hepatic toxicity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hematologic complications.

**Adverse Drug Effects**

1. **Mitochondrial Dysfunction**: lactic acidosis, hepatic toxicity, pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy.
2. **Metabolic Abnormalities**: fat maldistribution, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, bone disorders.
3. **Hematologic Adverse Events**: anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia.
4. **Allergic Reactions**: skin rashes, hypersensitivity.

**Specific Adverse Effects**

- **Lactic Acidosis**: secondary to NRTI treatment, inhibition of mitochondrial DNA replication, high mortality.
- **Hepatic Toxicity**: associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs; less common in pediatric patients.
- **Hyperlipidemia**: mainly PIs, elevated cholesterol and triglycerides.
- **Hyperglycemia and Insulin Resistance**: especially PIs, may cause atherosclerosis.
- **Hematologic Complications**: cytopenia, anemia (common with ZDV), neutropenia, thrombocytopenia.

**Drug Interactions**

- Common in HIV treatment; interactions with anesthetic and analgesic agents.
- PIs inhibit cytochrome P450, affecting metabolism of many drugs.
- Examples: prolonged neuromuscular blockade (vecuronium), reduced clearance of fentanyl (RTV), inhibited midazolam metabolism (saquinavir).

**Perioperative Antiretroviral Therapy**

- Continuation of antiretroviral therapy essential; no parenteral forms except fusion inhibitor and ZDV.
- Oral administration as soon as possible; gastrostomy administration if necessary.

![[96452BBD-5406-4C75-9B2C-E5A9BD465F05.jpeg]]### Anesthesia Considerations

**General Challenges**

- Anesthesia in HIV-infected children ranges from asymptomatic to severe multiorgan involvement.
- Asymptomatic patients with seropositivity alone generally do not require antiretroviral treatment and pose no major anesthetic problems.
- Patients with multiorgan involvement require careful anesthesia management, beginning with preoperative assessment.

**Preoperative Assessment**

- History, physical examination, and laboratory studies focus on:
	- Current HIV infection status.
	- Coexisting organ involvement.
	- Concurrent medications.
- Lower CD4+ count indicates more advanced disease requiring particular evaluation.
- Consider adverse drug effects and interactions with anesthesia drugs.
- Laboratory investigations: full blood count, clotting functions, hepatic and renal functions, glucose, electrolytes.
- Perform ECG and echocardiography if cardiac involvement is suspected.
- Chest X-ray to check for pulmonary tuberculosis in older children.

**Anesthesia Techniques and Agents**

- No specific recommended anesthesia technique or agent.
- General anesthesia is most common.
- Technique based on organ involvement:
	- High-inspired oxygen for pulmonary complications.
	- Careful hemodynamic monitoring for cardiovascular involvement.
	- Dosage adjustments for narcotics and muscle relaxants based on renal and hepatic function.
	- Avoid succinylcholine in cases of progressive neuropathy, myopathy, and muscle weakness due to hyperkalemia risk.

**Central Neural Blockade and HIV**

- Common regional anesthesia technique, especially caudal anesthesia.
- Safe use reported in obstetric patients without CNS involvement.
- No reports for HIV-infected children; evaluate CNS involvement and contraindications like thrombocytopenia before performing.
- Epidural blood patch has been used in HIV patients.

**Effect of Transfusion**

- Associated with immune response suppression.
- May accelerate disease progression in advanced HIV-1 infection.
- Increased plasma levels of HIV-1 and CMV after transfusion.
- Leucocyte-depleted RBC shows no benefit over nonfiltered blood.

**Pain in HIV-Infected Children**

- 20-60% affected by daily pain; only one-third receive appropriate analgesia.
- Associated with lower CD4+ count and severe immunosuppression.
- Pain management improves quality of life and is essential in care.
- Pain sources: invasive procedures, somatic pain, visceral pain, neuropathic pain, non-HIV-associated pain.
- Multidisciplinary approach for treatment, improving patient comfort and quality of life.

**Prevention of Infection**

- Continuous vigilance in preventative measures against infection transmission.
- **Transmission from HIV-Infected Children**:
	- HIV detected in body fluids; risk of transmission to healthcare workers.
	- Risk after percutaneous and mucous membrane exposure is 0.3% and 0.09%, respectively.
	- Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) reduces infection risk; should be started immediately after exposure.
	- Other infections, like tuberculosis, can contaminate equipment and spread.
- **Transmission to Other Patients**:
	- Strict aseptic precautions necessary.
	- No sharing of syringes.
	- Contaminated equipment must be discarded or sterilized.
- **Transmission to HIV-Infected Patients**:
	- Increased susceptibility to infections due to immunodeficiency.
	- Maintain strict aseptic techniques during anesthesia and surgery.

**Disclosure of HIV Status**

- Social circumstances and stigmatization issues.
- Maintain patient confidentiality in the operating room.
- Personnel must respect privacy and conduct themselves appropriately to avoid violating patient rights.

# TORCH Infections

**Introduction:**
- Congenital infection is a well-known cause of stillbirths and perinatal morbidity.
- TORCH infections include toxoplasmosis, Treponema pallidum, rubella, CMV, HSV, hepatitis viruses, HIV, varicella, and parvovirus B19.
- Epidemiology varies, with high burden in lowand middle-income countries.
- Transmission occurs prenatally (transplacental), perinatally (blood/vaginal secretions), and postnatally (breast milk for CMV, HIV, HSV).
- Evidence of infection can appear at birth, in infancy, or years later.
- Infected newborns may show abnormal growth, developmental anomalies, or clinical/lab abnormalities.
- Many clinical syndromes overlap, and some infections have classic physical stigmata.
- Early recognition, prenatal screening, and treatment/prevention strategies are key.

## Toxoplasmosis

**Disease Description:**
- Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite, with cats as definitive hosts.
- Parasite forms include oocysts, tachyzoites, and bradyzoites in tissue cysts.
- Cats acquire infection by consuming tissue cysts or oocysts.
- Replication occurs in the cat's intestine, and oocysts are excreted.

**Transmission/Pathogenesis:**
- Animals become infected from oocysts in the environment.
- Human infection occurs by ingesting tissue cysts from undercooked/raw meat, contact with cat feces, contaminated food/soil, or blood transfusion/organ transplantation.
- Three genotypes (I, II, III) of T. gondii exist; Type II causes most congenital infections in Europe/US.
- Congenital infection typically results from transplacental transmission during maternal primary infection.
- Reactivation in immunocompromised women (e.g., HIV) can lead to congenital toxoplasmosis.
- Lifelong immunity develops post-infection, but re-infection with a different genotype is possible.
- Risk of transmission increases with gestational age.

**Epidemiology:**
- Seroprevalence varies by country; highest in tropical regions and countries with raw meat consumption.
- Seroprevalence: 77% in Brazil, 44% in France, 11% in the US.
- Congenital infection prevalence: 0.1 to 0.01 per 1000 live births.
- Aggressive screening reduces maternal prevalence and congenital infection rates.

**Clinical Correlation:**
- 70%-90% of infected infants are asymptomatic at birth.
- Classic triad: chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, intracranial calcifications (rare but suggestive).
- Common manifestations include anemia, seizures, jaundice, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia.
- Severe manifestations usually indicate earlier infection in gestation.
- Mild or asymptomatic newborns are at risk for late manifestations and sequelae:
	- Chorioretinitis (20% at birth, up to 90% untreated later)
	- Motor/cerebellar dysfunction, microcephaly, seizures, intellectual disability, sensorineural hearing loss.

![[B49E7416-D309-4E5E-B0F3-FF23269E1CE7.jpeg]]

**Diagnosis and Treatment:**
**Prenatal:**
- No universally endorsed screening protocol.
- Screening based on risk factors and suspicious ultrasonography findings.
- Maternal screening includes:
	- T. gondii IgM (high false-positive rate, persists up to 2 years)
	- T. gondii IgG (more sensitive with IgG avidity testing)
	- PCR (amniotic fluid at 18 weeks for fetal infection)

![[1330940C-5C92-495A-8B75-04D797E22367.jpeg]]

**Maternal Treatment:**
- Spiramycin before 18 weeks until PCR/ultrasonography results.
- If fetal infection is confirmed, switch to pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, folinic acid, and spiramycin.
- No trial data on efficacy, but observational data suggest decreased fetal infection and neurologic sequelae.

**Postnatal:**
- For infants with stigmata of congenital toxoplasmosis:
	- IgG, IgM, IgA, and PCR testing (preferably at reference labs)
	- Ophthalmologic, auditory, and neurologic examinations
	- CT head for intracranial calcifications
- Treatment for 12 months with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid.
- Repeat testing 1 month after therapy.
- Sequential follow-up with serial ophthalmologic, auditory, and neurologic exams to recognize sequelae.
## Treponema Pallidum

- **Syphilis**: Sexually transmitted infection caused by Treponema pallidum.
- **Treatable congenital infection**: Preventable infection of newborns via maternal treatment during pregnancy.
- **Transmission**: Spirochetes cross placenta during pregnancy.

**Transmission/Pathogenesis**

- **Congenital infection detection**: After 18-22 weeks’ gestation.

- **Global impact estimates**:
	- 520,905 adverse outcomes from maternal syphilis.
	- 212,327 stillbirths.
	- 92,764 neonatal deaths.
	- 65,267 preterm/low birth weight infants.
	- 151,547 infected newborns.
	- 66% adverse outcomes in antenatal clinic attendees not screened/treated.

**Clinical Evidence of Congenital Syphilis**
![[B39E8B00-2802-40A4-A4F6-49EC43A08C30.jpeg]]
- **Early manifestations (within 2 years)**: Hepatosplenomegaly, snuffles, lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions, pneumonia, osteochondritis, pseudoparalysis, maculopapular rash, edema, Coombs negative hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia.
- **Untreated infants**: May present later with CNS, bone/joint, teeth, eye, and skin issues.

**Discussion**

- **Diagnosis and treatment**
	- **Prenatal maternal screening**:
		- All pregnant women should be screened at first prenatal visit.
		- Repeat screening at delivery is advocated.
	- **Maternal treatment**:
		- Intramuscular benzathine penicillin.

		- Dilution recommended for high titer samples (prozone effect).
		- Confirm reactive tests with Treponema-specific tests (fluorescent antibody absorption, microhemagglutination, enzyme immunoassay, particle agglutination tests).

**Guidance**

- **Interpretation of maternal and infant testing**.
- **Treatment guidelines**: Endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) as provided in the 2012 AAP Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases (page 695).

## Rubella

- **Congenital rubella**: Infection with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus.
- **Transmission**: Occurs by inhalation of aerosolized particles from an infected individual.

**Transmission/Pathogenesis**

- **Primary maternal infection**: Highest risk in the first trimester (80%-100%), lower risk in the second trimester (10%-20%), increased risk at term (up to 60%).
- **Cellular damage**: Causes necrotizing vasculitis and inflammatory response.
- **Outcomes**: Miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).
- **Vertical transmission risk**: 80%-90% from nonimmune mothers with primary rubella infection in the first trimester, associated with severe manifestations at birth.

**Epidemiology**

- **US status**: Indigenous rubella transmission and CRS declared eliminated in 2004.

	- **Prenatal**:
		- **Prevention**: Rubella vaccination for all children and adolescents.
		- **Women of childbearing age**: Should show evidence of immunity; if nonimmune, vaccinated with 1 dose of MMR vaccine.
		- **Pregnant women**: Serologic screening with rubella IgG; nonimmune women vaccinated with MMR post-pregnancy and advised to avoid pregnancy for 28 days post-vaccination.
	- **Postnatal**:
		- **Diagnosis**:
			- Isolation of virus by PCR or culture.
			- Rubella-specific IgM, usually positive at birth to 3 months for congenital infection.
				- Diagnosis confirmed by stable or increasing rubella-specific IgG concentrations over 7-11 months.
				- False-positive IgM possible; IgG avidity testing can help diagnose recent infection.
			- Rubella virus RNA detection by reverse transcriptase PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs, urine, CSF, and blood at birth.
		- **Reporting**: Suspected CRS cases should be reported to the CDC.
		- **Contagious period**: All infants with CRS are contagious until at least 1 year of age unless 2 cultures 1 month apart are negative for rubella virus after 3 months of age. Specific treatment for infected children is not available.
	
## Parvovirus B19

- **Human parvovirus B19**: Single-stranded DNA virus in the family Parvoviridae.
- **Transmission**: Primarily via respiratory droplets; also from blood products and prenatal vertical transmission.

**Transmission/Pathogenesis**

- **Immunity in women of childbearing age**: 35%-55% not immune.
- **Incidence in pregnancy**: Approximately 1%-2%, varies seasonally or during outbreaks.
- **Vertical transmission rate**: Approximately 35%.
- **Fetal infection**: Via transplacental transmission 1-3 weeks after maternal infection, during peak maternal viremia.
- **Occupational exposure risk**: Higher risk for healthcare workers, childcare workers, or teachers; CDC does not recommend job restriction for pregnant women.

**Clinical Correlation**

- **Parvovirus B19 infection symptoms**:
	- **Facial rash**: Described as slapped cheek.
	- **Rash on trunk**: Pruritic, laticiform macular rash spreading to extremities.
	- **Polyarthritis**: Possible.

	- **Asymptomatic**: Many women during primary infection.
- **Fetal infection outcomes**:
	- Spontaneous resolution or severe consequences like nonimmune hydrops fetalis, miscarriage.
	- **Affinity to erythroid progenitor cells**: Infection of endothelial and myocardial cells.
	- **Fetal anemia and myocarditis**: Due to toxic cell injury and apoptosis.
	- **Highest risk**: Infection before the end of the first trimester.
	- **Prenatal sonogram anomalies**: Evident at 1-33 weeks gestation.

**Fetal Parvovirus Infection Consequences**

- Fetal demise.
- Severe anemia.
- Nonimmune hydrops fetalis.
	- High-output cardiac failure from anemia.
	- Myocardial failure from infection.
- Thrombocytopenia.
- Maternal mirror syndrome.
- Rare but possible meningoencephalitis.
- Premature delivery often required.
- Persistent viremia and anemia in the infant.

**Discussion - Diagnosis and Treatment**

- **Prenatal**:
	- No routine screening protocol.
	- Diagnosis via maternal symptoms, suspicious ultrasonography findings, or known maternal exposure.
	- **Maternal infection diagnosis**:
		- **Parvovirus IgM**: Detectable in serum 7-10 days post-infection, peaks at 10-14 days, sensitivity 60%-70% between 8-12 weeks post-infection.
		- **Parvovirus B19 DNA PCR**: Sensitivity up to 96%, DNA levels may persist post-acute infection.
	- **Fetal infection diagnosis**:
		- Amniotic fluid PCR.
		- Monitoring for fetal hydrops and anemia recommended for 12-20 weeks post-exposure.
- **Treatment**:
	- No treatment for maternal infection.
	- **Fetal treatment**: Targeted towards anemia and hydrops, primarily through in utero fetal transfusion.
- **Postnatal**:
	- Treatment for hydropic neonate is primarily supportive.
	- Persistent congenital infection with red cell aplasia managed with supportive care and prenatal transfusion therapy.
	- Intravenous gamma globulin may reduce need for red blood cell transfusion, but often requires repeated infusions for weeks to months post-birth.
- **Long-term outcomes**:
	- Limited data from case series.
	- Possible increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment.
	- Generally, survivors of the neonatal period have a good prognosis and neurologic outcomes.
## Hepatitis B

- **HBV**: Partially double-stranded circular DNA enveloped hepadnavirus.
- **Structure**:
	- Outer lipoprotein envelope with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
	- Inner nucleocapsid with hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg).
	- Genome: 4 partially overlapping open reading frames coding for HBsAg, HBcAg, HBeAg, viral polymerase, and regulatory X protein.
- **Pathogenesis**:
	- HBV is not directly cytotoxic; injury is due to host immune response, particularly cytotoxic T cells.
	- After infection, HBV DNA and HBsAg increase in serum, peak before acute disease, and decrease after clinical symptoms onset.
	- HBV genome can integrate into hepatocytes, causing occult HBV infection.

**Transmission/Pathogenesis**

- **MTCT**:
	- Mostly occurs at delivery, <2%-4% in utero.
	- Hypothesized prenatal transmission via transplacental, inhalation, or ingestion of amniotic fluid.
	- Possible but unproven transmission via procedures like amniocentesis.
	- Highest transmission from mothers positive for HBsAg and HBeAg.
- **Risk**:
	- 5%-20% risk for infants of HBsAg-positive but HBeAg-negative mothers.
	- Up to 90% risk for infants of mothers positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg.

**Epidemiology**

- **Global impact**: Affects ~360 million people.
- **Prevalence**:
	- High (>8%): Up to half the world’s population.
	- Intermediate (2%-7%): Multiple transmission modes (perinatal, household, sexual, drug use).
	- Low (<2%): New infections peak among unimmunized older age groups.
- **CHB**: Transmission during pregnancy/delivery responsible for >1/3 of cases worldwide.

**Clinical Correlation**

- **CHB risk**:
	- 90% of infants infected perinatally or in the first year develop CHB.
	- 25%-50% of children infected between 1-5 years develop CHB.
	- 5%-10% of acutely infected older children/adults develop CHB.
- **Infant infection**: Rarely shows signs at birth; diagnosed by HBsAg presence at 1-2 months.
- **Stages**:
	- Immune tolerant: High HBV DNA, detectable HBeAg, mild liver abnormalities.
	- Immune active/clearance, inactive carrier state, reactivation stages follow.
- **Symptoms**: Jaundice, poor feeding, vomiting in a few infants.

**Diagnosis and Treatment**

- **Prenatal**:
	- All pregnant women should be screened for HBsAg at the first prenatal visit.
	- Additional screening at delivery if maternal risk factors are present.
- **Postnatal**:
	- Newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers should receive:
		- Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth.
		- Complete vaccine series per ACIP/AAP schedule.
	- **Follow-up**:
		- Testing after vaccine series at 9-18 months of age.
		- Avoid testing before 9 months to prevent false positives and maximize disease detection.
	- **Breastfeeding**: Not increased risk of transmission if infants receive timely HBIG and vaccine.

**Best Practice for HBV Screening and Prophylaxis**

- **Universal Screening**:
	- All pregnant women screened for HBV (HBsAg) at first prenatal visit, regardless of risk.
- **Repeat Screening**:
	- High-risk women screened again at delivery.
- **Prophylaxis of Infant**:
	- **Maternal HBsAg positive**:
		- HBIG 0.5 mL IM and single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine IM within 12 hours of delivery.
		- Complete vaccine series by 6 months of life.
		- Follow-up testing at 9 to 18 months.
	- **Maternal HBsAg negative**:
		- Single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine IM soon after birth, before hospital discharge.
		- Complete vaccine series by 6 to 18 months of life.
