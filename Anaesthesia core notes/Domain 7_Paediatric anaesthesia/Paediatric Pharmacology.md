# Paediatric Anaesthetic Pharmacology
## Introduction
- Ethically and practically more difficult to undertake pharmacological research in children compared with adults.
	- less data available regarding many drugs commonly used in paediatric practice.
	- a number of commonly used drugs are unlicensed for use in children.
- Children are not merely small adults.
- Altered pharmacokinetics and dynamics are most marked in the first year of life but persist to about 10 years of age.
- Childhood can be divided into various classes of age where each group should be considered as a special population:
	- Preterm newborn
	- Newborn (0–28 days)
	- Infant (>28 days–12 months)
	- Toddler (>12 months–23 months)
	- Preschool child (2–5 years)
	- School age child (6–11 years)
	- Adolescents (12–18 years)
- Factors that influence tissue drug concentrations over time:
	- absorption
	- distribution
	- metabolism
	- excretion (ADME).
- These ADME processes differ in paediatric populations compared with adults and have consequences on the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug.
- Pharmacokinetic studies measure the concentration of drug found within body fluids, usually blood or plasma, over time.
- The aim of a pharmacokinetic study is typically to match the exposure in paediatric patients to that found in adults.
- In paediatrics, pharmacokinetic analysis is usually simpler than pharmacodynamic studies owing to the complexity of the latter.
	- For example, measurement of subjective symptoms such as pain requires different assessment instruments for patients of different ages.
- The incidence of intra-operative awareness under anaesthesia is reported to be much higher in paediatrics compared with adults.
## General Pharmacology

### Absorption
- Liberation of drug from a formulation can differ in children since gut transit time and intestinal fluid composition (including pH) can significantly affect drug dissolution.
- Intestinal transit time has been reported to be shorter in young children which may reduce the amount of drug absorbed, particularly for poorly soluble drugs or sustained release products (e.g. theophylline).
- Gastric pH is neutral at birth
	- greater peak concentrations of penicillin, an acid labile drug, observed in newborns where gastric pH is higher compared with infants and children.
	- Weakly basic drugs, such as itraconazole (pKa = 3.7): higher serum concentrations being obtained at lower gastric pH levels.
- Bile secretion in the first 2–3 weeks of life is known to be poor with luminal concentrations lower than in adult intestines (2–4 mM vs. 3–5 mM respectively).
	- Drug solubility increases with bile salt concentration
	- A difference in concentration may have an impact on absorption in paediatrics.
		- particular risk for poorly soluble drugs (e.g. hydrocortisone).
- Intestinal permeability is reported to be high at birth with progressive reduction during the first week of life.
	- This is related to:
		- Reduced surface area: volume ratio within the intestine owing to the villi being broader and providing a smaller overall surface area.
- Metabolism in the gut lumen and wall can decrease the absorption of a wide variety of drugs including ciclosporin, nifedipine, midazolam and verapamil.
	- The major enzyme family involved in gut wall metabolism of drugs is cytochrome P450 (CYPs).
- Gastric emptying rate is reduced in the neonate:
	- may reduce the rate of absorption of orally administered drugs if they are mainly absorbed distal to the stomach.
	- and bioavailability if they are inactivated by low pH.
- Intra-muscular injection of drugs in children exhibit more rapid onset of action than in adults due to:
	- relatively higher cardiac output
	- increased muscle blood flow.
- IM route not commonly used in paediatric practice.
- Absorption by the rectal route can be erratic and depends on:
	- the quantity of faeces in the rectum
	- whether the drug is administered high or low into the rectum
	- duration of retention of the suppository
	- pH of the preparation.
- Premedication such as midazolam have been administered intra-nasally but this can be dis-
tressing for the child.
- Inhalational agents are taken up and eliminated more rapidly in children.
- For nitrous oxide, an FI:FA ratio of 1.0 is achieved in:
	- 25 min in infants
	- 30 min in children
	- 60 min in adults.
- Reasons for increased speed speed of onset:
	- Tidal volumes remain relatively constant throughout life at approximately 7ml/kg but the ratio of alveolar ventilation to the functional residual capacity is 5:1 in infants compared with 1.4:1 in adults.
	- The tissue:gas and blood:gas solubility of volatile agents is reduced in infants.
	- Increased cardiac output in infants might be expected to reduce the speed of inhalational induction but this is off-set by the greater proportion of cardiac output directed to the vessel-rich tissues and the reduction in fat and muscle mass in the infant.
- Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is inversely related to age in children.

### Distribution
- Influenced by:
	- plasma protein binding
	- blood volume
	- solubility coefficient
	- tissue blood-flow.
- The distribution of drugs affects efficacy and duration of action.
- The distribution of drugs is dependent upon body composition.
- Lipophilic drugs have a relatively larger volume of distribution in infants compared with older children due to higher levels of fat (22.4% at 12 months vs. 13% at 15 years).
	- Diazepam (lipophilic drug) has a ratio of adult volume of distribution to that of a newborn of 0.7.
- Hydrophilic drugs also have larger volumes of distribution in preschool children as extracellular water decreases during development, from 70% total body weight in newborns to 61.2% in 1-year-old infants.
	- Consequently higher doses per kilogram bodyweight must be given to infants compared with adults to achieve comparable plasma and tissue concentrations.
- Protein affects the volume of distribution of drugs.
#### Comparative Protein Binding in Pediatric Populations Compared with Reference Adult Values

| Parameter              | Neonate   | Infant            | Child      |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Total Protein          | Decreased | Decreased         | Equivalent |
| Plasma Albumin         | Decreased | Equivalent        | Equivalent |
| Plasma Globulin        | Decreased | Decreased         | Equivalent |
| α1-acid Glycoprotein   | Decreased | No data available | Equivalent |
| Free Fatty Acids       | Increased | Equivalent        | Equivalent |
| Unconjugated Bilirubin | Increased | Equivalent        | Equivalent |

- In newborns, total plasma protein concentrations are 86% of adult values.
- Drugs where lower protein binding has been documented in newborn babies:
	- phenytoin
	- salicylates
	- ampicillin
	- nafcillin
	- sulfisoxazole
	- sulfamethoxyphrazine
- Greater free fractions of these drugs are circulating and thus are able to penetrate various tissue compartments, yielding higher distribution volumes.
- Influence of protein binding on free plasma drug concentrations is limited to drugs which have a high degree of protein binding (>95%).
- Neonatal albumin is present in a reduced concentration and has a lower affinity for drugs.
- Neonates also have reduced α -acid glycoprotein (AAGP), which is the major binding protein for many alkaline drugs (including local anaesthetics and opioids).
- Increased volume of distribution (Vd) for highly ionised(water soluble) drugs due to:
	- Increased total body water
	- extracellular fluid volume
	- blood volume
- Increased cardiac output allows a more rapid delivery of drugs to the target tissues, with a greater proportion being directed to the vessel rich tissues such as the brain.
- Reduced muscle mass and fat stores: smaller amount taken up into inactive sites and a smaller reservoir for fat-soluble drugs.
- Blood–brain barrier is immature at birth: greater uptake of partially ionised drugs (e.g. morphine).
### Metabolism
- Microsomal protein content in the liver increases with age from 26 mg/g in newborns to max of 40 mg/g in a 30-year-old adult.
- Drugs that are highly metabolized are administered at a lower mg/kg dose in newborns compared with preschool children due to these differences in enzyme levels.
	- The hepatic clearance of drugs can be higher in infants and preschool children as liver blood flow is increased compared with adults, owing to the larger ratio of liver to total body mass in infants and children.
		- This can increase the first pass effect where a drug is cleared on first passage through the liver although level of enzyme activity will influence this parameter.
- Differences in enzyme expression and activity can result in:
	- altered metabolism of drugs (e.g. midazolam and zidovudine)
	- production of metabolites in paediatric populations that are not observed in adults (e.g. caffeine production in newborns receiving theophylline, differences in metabolite production in children with valproic acid, paracetamol, chloramphenicol, cimetidine and salicylamide).
- Drug metabolism in the gut lumen and gut wall An alteration in bacterial colonization of the intestine with age has implications in terms of drug metabolism within the gut.
	- Metabolism in the gut lumen and wall can decrease the bioavailability and the pharmacological effects of a wide variety of drugs including:
		- ciclosporin
		- nifedipine
		- midazolam
		- verapamil
- Liver is principal site of metabolism.
- Hepatically metabolised drugs may exhibit a prolonged half-life compared with adults.
	- Phase I reactions convert the drug to a more polar metabolite
	- Phase II reactions involve processes (e.g. conjugation) that render the drug or its metabolite more hydrophilic and renally excretable.
- Microsomal activity requires cytochrome P450 system, which is incomplete or absent in the neonate.
- Phase I reactions reach adult levels a few days after birth.
- Phase II reactions mature by 3 months.
- Metabolism reaches a maximum level during the latter part of the first decade, often exceeding adult rates.
### Excretion
- Elimination of drugs and their metabolites occurs predominantly via the kidneys.
- The excretion of drugs and their metabolites from the kidneys is influenced by:
	- the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
	- clearance
	- proximal tubular secretion.
- All of these are reduced in infants, particularly premature neonates.
- The GFR is 2 to 4 ml min−1 1.73 m−2 in term neonates, and it doubles by 1 week of age, reaching adult values by the end of the first year of life.
- The renal excretion of unchanged drug is lower in newborns due to the immaturity of renal function.
- Creatinine clearance is often used to estimate GFR in children where a reduction in drug dose is advised if creatinine clearance is less than the normal GFR.
- Urinary pH value can influence the reabsorption of weak acids or bases which, in turn, will influence the elimination.
	- Infant urinary pH is lower than adult values which may increase the reabsorption of weakly acidic drugs.
- The dose requirements of renally excreted drugs (e.g. penicillins and aminoglycosides) may need to be reduced, particularly in neonates.

## Pharmacodynamics in Paediatric Populations
- Pharmacodynamics comprises the physiological and biological response to the drug and is not always directly related to pharmacokinetics.
- The relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in children is vital for rational dosing and cannot be ignored.
- Pharmacokinetic analysis uses biological samples to quantify drug concentration over time.
- Pharmacodynamic analysis requires endpoint measures that have been validated in children.
## Paediatric Dose Selection
- Most methods of paediatric dose adjustments are based on simple algorithms, rather than pharmacokinetic data, that extrapolate an adult dose based on body weight, height or a combination of both expressed as body surface area.
	- Analysis of scaling models to predict maintenance doses for children demonstrated that body weight was the better method in terms of precision and bias for children from 1 month to 1 year, whereas, body surface area was better in older children
	- There is not a single dosing algorithm appropriate for all age ranges.
	- There are still instances where dosage information for children is unavailable and scaling from adult doses is the only available method to enable medication supply.
		- In such cases the therapeutic index of the drug, its toxicity profile, the age of the child and the route by which the drug is cleared need to be carefully considered.
## Pharmacology of Some Drugs Commonly Used in Anaesthetic Practice
### Intravenous Induction agents-Propofol
- Propofol first used in children in 1985.
- Higher induction dose required (typically 2.5–3.5mg/kg), particularly in younger children.
- Pharmacokinetic changes in children compared to adults:
	- Central volume of distribution 50% greater (0.34–1.03 litre/kg)
	- Clearance (34.3ml/kg/min) to be 25% greater.
- Children require approximately 50% more propofol than adults for the maintenance of anaesthesia.
- Diprofusor not licensed for use in children (16 years or less).
- The UK Committee on Safety of Medicines specifically prohibits propofol infusion for sedation on ICU in children < 16 years of age due to concerns over increased mortality and morbidity resulting from lactic acidosis.
- Propofol is licensed for use as an induction agent for children of 1 month and over and for the maintenance of general anaesthesia in children of 3 years and above.
- It is not recommended for sedation during surgical and diagnostic procedures in children, as safety and efficacy have not been demonstrated.
- The pattern of recovery from propofol is similar to adults.
- Recovery is more rapid when compared with thiopental as an induction agent.
- Awakening following induction and maintenance with propofol is more rapid than with halothane, but slower than with sevoflurane.
- There is little difference between any of the agents in time-to-discharge from recovery or hospital.
- Propofol may have an anti-emetic effect in children.
- Following induction of anaesthesia, MAP is reduced to a greater degree than with thiopental.
- There is no compensatory tachycardia and bradycardia may occur, particularly if anaesthesia is maintained with propofol in combination with vagotonic drugs or vagally stimulating surgical procedures in children aged 2 years or less.
- The systemic vascular resistance is reduced by 15–20% and the cardiac index falls by 13%.
- Apnoea occurs more commonly and airway reflexes are suppressed to a greater degree than with thiopental.
- As with adults, involuntary movements may occur at any time during propofol anaesthesia.
### Volatile agentsSevoflurane
- Widely used for inhalational induction in children.
- Relatively pleasant smell.
- Blood gas solubility coefficient of 0.68 allowing rapid induction and recovery.
- MAC falls with increasing age.

![[E07A7BDA-6FD1-46EB-9628-3F7BAB542069.jpeg]]

- Unlike other volatile agents, there is no increase in MAC in the first few months of life.
- Tracheal intubation is possible with an end-tidal concentration of 1.3 MAC.
- LMA insertion is achievable with end-tidal concentrations of 1 MAC.
- The low blood:gas solubility coefficient allows a more rapid recovery than with halothane, but early postoperative pain scores are higher.
- Increased incidence of agitation during recovery, particularly if used as a maintenance agent.
- Sevoflurane is relatively cardiostable:
	- causing less tachycardia than isoflurane
	- less myocardial depression
	- fewer arrhythmias
	- less sensitisation to catecholamines than halothane.
- Sympathetic nervous system activation and coronary steal do not occur with sevoflurane anaesthesia.
- Respiratory effects:
	- Dose-dependent depression of tidal volume
	- Reduction in respiratory rate
	- Shifting of the carbon dioxide response curves.
- CNS effects:
	- Effects on intra-cranial pressure are similar to those seen with isoflurane.
	- There is little effect on the cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic requirement for oxygen, or cerebral autoregulation.
	- There may be seizure-like activity on induction.
	- Neuromuscular block is potentiated.
### OpioidsMorphine
- Several opioids are routinely used in paediatric practice and a number of generalisations can be applied to their pharmacological disposition in children:
	- Vc tends to be greater in the young child than the adult.
	- Steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) stays the same or decreases with age.
	- Clearance increases with age.
	- The elimination half-life is greatest in the neonate, decreasing to its lowest level in the young child and then increasing to adult levels.
- Morphine is the most widely studied opioid in the paediatric population.
- Plasma protein binding is age dependent–28% in the neonate compared to 50% in the adult.
- It is used at a dose of 100 μg/kg IV bolus, 200ug/kg IM and approximately 20ug/kg/hr as IV infusion.
- Following long infusions, plasma and CSF morphine concentrations approach equilibration.
- Morphine is metabolised in the liver to inactive morphine-3-glucuronide and active morphine-6-glucuronide.
- Glucuronide metabolism is proportional to age for the first 2.5 years of life.
- In neonates, about 20% of morphine is excreted unchanged via the kidneys compared with the adult value of 10%. Clearance is age dependent, being maximal in pre-school age children (20–40 ml/kg/min).
	- In premature neonates, this value may be as low as 0.5–3 ml kg min.
- Consequently, elimination half-life is lowest in pre-school children.
- Morphine is used for analgesia or sedation.
	- The plasma concentration required for adequate analgesia and sedation is age ependent.
	- Following orthopaedic thoracic surgery, mean concentration in infants for adequate analgesia was 26 ug/litre vs 4 ug/litre in 2-6 year olds.
- The side-effects of opioids in children are similar to those seen in adults:
	- nausea and vomiting
	- sedation
	- pruritus
	- urinary retention
	- respiratory depression.
		- Some degree of respiratory depression has been reported with plasma concentrations of morphine > 20 μg litre.
		- It has traditionally been thought that infants are at a higher risk of respiratory depression but a study of the ventilatory effects of IV morphine in 30 patients aged 2–570 days found no age-related differences in respiratory effects at the same plasma concentrations.
		- The neonate may be more susceptible to morphine accumulation because of differences in pharmacological disposition.
- Doses of opioids should always be titrated to effect.
### Local Anaesthetic agentsBupivacaine
- There are a limited amount of paediatric data available and this relates mainly to bupivacaine.
- Differences in Paediatrics and adults:
	- Clearance of bupivacaine is approximately 10 ml/kg/min in neonates compared to 3 ml/kg/min in adults.
	- Vd greater in neonates (4.5 litre/kg) than adults (1–2 litre/kg).
	- Elimination half-life is greater in neonates (7 h versus ~3 h).
- Therefore, doses of bupivacaine, given on a mg/kg basis, have greater potential for toxicity in neonates and infants than in adults.
- In the neonate, the blood–brain barrier is not fully formed:
	- allows free drug to pass more easily into the central nervous system.
- In plasma, local anaesthetics are bound to AAGP.
	- The concentration of AAGP increases 3–5fold in the first year of life and by a further 25% during childhood.
	- There will be substantially more free drug in the neonatal plasma than in the older child or adult.
- Practical considerations play a great part in the increased toxicity of local anaesthetic agents in babies and children.
	- Small size increases the likelihood of inappropriate injection.
	- The potential for accidental intrathecal injection during caudal anaesthesia is recognised because the dural sac extends down to S3 in the neonate compared with S2 in adults.
- Most local anaesthetic administrations are performed following a general anaesthetic rendering the ‘test dose’ useless and obtunding several signs of toxicity (e.g. drowsiness and convulsions).
- Ropivacaine exhibits less toxicity.
- Studies in infants and children under 5 years demonstrate an age-related decrease in peak plasma concentration of drug following caudal administration of a 2mg/kg bolus, with mean concentrations of 0.73 ug/ml in those under 1 year compared with 0.49 ug/ml in those aged 1-5 years.
- This difference may be explained by:
	- increased tissue perfusion
	- reduced tissue uptake
	- reduced metabolism.
- Studies have demonstrated that ropivacaine administered epidurally has a plasma half-life of 4.9 h in children, which is similar to that in adults.
### Muscle Relaxants
- The neuromuscular junction in the neonate is immature:
	- it has smaller reserves of acetylcholine than the older patient.
- Neonates are said to have a myasthenic response to muscle relaxants, exhibit tetanic fade in the absence of relaxants, and are proportionally more sensitive to non-depolarising relaxants than infants and children.
- Diaphragmatic muscle in infants and children differs from that of adults in that there are proportionally fewer (slow) type 1 fibres and more (fast) type 2 in younger subjects.
	- Type 2 fibres are more easily fatigued than type 1 which may explain an apparent sensitivity of the infant diaphragm to non-depolarising relaxants.
- Several non-depolarising relaxants exhibit a prolonged elimination half-life when compared with the adult.
	- This results in slower recovery and risk of accumulation following repeated, non-monitored, administration.
	- For renally excreted drugs, this is related to reduced GFR.
	- Hepatically excreted drugs (e.g. vecuronium) exhibit a larger Vd but no age-related change in clearance and, therefore, prolonged excretion.
		- Atracurium and mivacurium are the exceptions to this as they undergo inactivation by hydrolysis or Hoffman degradation and plasma cholinesterase, respectively, prior to excretion.
	- Atracurium and vecuronium are used at bolus doses of 500ug/kg and 100ug/kg respectively.
	- The neonate is relatively resistant to succinylcholine, there-by completing the picture of a myasthenic response.
		- This is due to the greater extracellular fluid volume in these patients resulting in a lower plasma concentration of drug (from a weight calculated dose) rather than any property of the neonatal neuromuscular junction.
		- Succinylcholine has side-effects similar to those seen in adult practice.
			- It is used at a dose of 1–2 mg kg.
			- Myalgia is experienced from approximately 9 years of age.
			- Bradycardia is seen after a single dose in some children.
			- Cardiac arrest has been reported in several patients, some of whom some were found to have a previously undiagnosed muscular dystrophy.
				- Children with muscular dystrophy develop severe hyperkalaemia in response to succinylcholine.
				- These cases have led to a recommendation (from the FDA in the US) that succinylcholine be reserved for emergency intubation only.
