# Anaesthesia for Mediastinal Masses

**Mediastinum Anatomy:**
- Extends from the thoracic inlet above to the diaphragm below.
- Lies between the medial parietal pleura of both lungs.
- Divided into superior and inferior sections:
	- the division is an imaginary line extending from sternomanubrial junction to T4 vertebra
- Inferior further divided into anterior, middle, and posterior:
- **Anterior Mediastinum:**
	- Location:
		- Posterior to the sternum
		- Anterior to the pericardium
		- Superior to the diaphragm
		- Inferior to the superior mediastinum
		- Medial to the parietal pleurae
- **Middle Mediastinum:**
	- Borders:
		- Anteriorly by the anterior margin of the pericardium
		- Posteriorly by the posterior border of the pericardium
		- Laterally by the mediastinal pleura (parietal pleura) of the lungs
		- Superiorly by the superior mediastinum
		- Inferiorly by the diaphragm
- **Posterior Mediastinum:**
	- Location:
		- Posterior to the pericardium and great vessels
		- Anterior to the T4–T12 vertebrae
		- Superior to the diaphragm
		- Inferior to the superior mediastinum
		- Lateral to the parietal pleurae
- Superior and anterior often considered as one.

**Anaesthesia Considerations for Mediastinal Masses:**
1. **Risk Assessment:**
	- Airway Compromise and Compression:
		- Signs: Wheezing, severe dyspnea, orthopnea.
		- Determine position of maximum comfort for use during anaesthesia.
	- Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Obstruction Syndrome:
		- Indicates invasive lesion.
		- Symptoms: Dilated collateral veins of upper thorax and neck, edema of face, neck, upper torso, and airway mucosa.
		- Suffusion and edema of conjunctiva with or without proptosis.
		- CNS symptoms: Headache, altered mentation.
	- Tachyarrhythmias:
		- Signs of critical compression or cardiac ischemia.
	- Syncope During Forced Valsalva Maneuver:
		- Indicates significant cardiac or pulmonary artery involvement.
	- Implications:
		- Presence of these signs usually indicates compression or invasion of the trachea and major bronchi, SVC, heart, pericardium, and pulmonary artery.
		- Anesthesia is hazardous due to potential severe compromise of oxygenation and cardiac output from loss of muscle tone, even without muscle relaxants.
2. **Pre-operative Workup:**

![[86524539-DA1F-49D2-A26A-F4A3E418F9A4.jpeg]]

- Other signs and symptoms include chest pain, sweats and dysphagia.
- Blood chemistry, haematology and hormone assays may be required, depending on:
	- type of tumour
	- condition of the patient,for example lymphoma, thyroid or parathyroid
- Some important points in the pre-operative evaluation and workup of these patients:
	- IF there are respiratory symptoms (dyspnoea, orthopnoea) look for the degree of tracheobronchial compression on CT or MRI
		- 50% reduction of airway diameter is associated with severe intra-operative respiratory compromise, especially in children
		- the severity of a patient’s pre-operative respiratory symptoms may not relate to the degree of respiratory compromise encountered during anaesthesia.
	- In SVC obstruction, pre-operative steroids may reduce airway oedema significantly (as well as occasionally shrinking the mediastinal tumour.
	- The absence of symptoms does not mean that cardio-respiratory compromise is not present.
3. **Local vs. General Anaesthesia:**
	- Decision based on surgical requirements and patient status.
4. **Anaesthetic Management**
## Anaesthetic Management of Mediastinal Masses

**Classification of Mediastinal Masses:**
1. **Minimal Compression:**
	- Managed according to routine practice.
2. **Mild Compression:**
	- Requires some modification to anaesthetic technique.
	- May be difficult to assess.
3. **Potentially Life-Threatening:**
	- Risk of airway and/or cardiovascular collapse.
	- Demands tailored anaesthetic or possible cancellation.
	- Consider alternative approaches (e.g., CT-guided needle biopsy).
**Tailoring Anaesthetic Technique:**
- Based on pre-operative findings.
- Prefer local anaesthesia without sedation for tissue diagnosis.
- Seek peripheral tissues for biopsy (e.g., neck, axillary, inguinal lymph nodes) or pleural fluid.
- CT-guided needle biopsies as alternatives.
**Premedication:**
- Often omitted but must be carefully considered.
**Hazards of General Anaesthesia:**
- Severe airway obstruction due to loss of muscle tone:
	- Rigid bronchoscope must be available.
	- Change in patient position or other methods of airway stenting may improve oxygenation.
- Hypoxaemia, hypotension, cardiac arrest due to compression of pulmonary trunk or arteries:
	- These patients may be asymptomatic when awake
	- Facilities for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) must be available for select patients.

**General Anaesthesia for Diagnostic or Definitive Surgery:**
**Principles:**
- **Intravenous Access:**
	- For patients with SVC obstruction, place IV and central venous cannulae in lower limbs.
	- Central venous cannulation recommended except for short biopsy cases.
- **Position:**
	- Critical for anterior masses; determine pre-operatively with the patient.
	- Semi-fowler’s position may be optimal for SVC obstruction.
- **Induction:**
	- Maintain spontaneous ventilation and avoid positive pressure ventilation.
	- Sevoflurane is the most suitable volatile agent.
	- Intubation may require a fibre-optic bronchoscope and difficult airway devices, including a jet ventilator.
	- Determine the need for awake intubation pre-operatively.
- **Ventilation:**
	- Use IPPV once the chest is open, with or without muscle relaxants.
- **Muscle Relaxants:**
	- Generally avoid, especially in patients with anterior mediastinal masses.
- **Monitoring:**
	- Insert arterial line for continuous blood pressure monitoring
		- more accurate determination of cardiac output, as well as blood gas measurement
		- recommended in the right arm
	- ECG
	- non-invasive blood pressure
	- capnography
	- pulse oximetry
	- urine output
	- temperature.
- **Intravenous Fluid Management:**
	- Keep the patient volume replete, especially if venous return is impaired.
- **Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB):**
	- Necessary for pulmonary artery compression.
	- Prepare groins and cannulate under local anaesthetic.
	- CPB should be ready and not just "on standby."
## Postoperative Issues

- **Complications:**
	- More likely to occur postoperatively.
	- Airway and respiratory problems are common; cardiovascular issues are less common.
- **Important Factors:**
	- Presence of SVC syndrome with airway oedema.
	- Tumour swelling post biopsy or partial resection.
	- Bleeding, which can be minimal or catastrophic.
	- Damage to mediastinal structures such as nerves.
- **Post Obstructive Pulmonary Oedema:**
	- Reported once.

**Specific Cases:**
- Thymoma (with or without myasthenia gravis), thyroid, parathyroid
	- for separate discussion.

### Mediastinoscopy
- **Cervical Approach:**
	- Common method.
	- 2-3 cm incision in the suprasternal notch.
	- Dissection between left innominate vein and sternum.
	- Mediastinoscope inserted anterior to the aortic arch.
- **Anterior Approach:**
	- Through second intercostal space, lateral to sternal border.
	- Used to inspect the lower mediastinum.
- **Contra-indications:**
	- Previous mediastinoscopy due to scar tissue.
	- SVC syndrome (relative contraindication due to bleeding risk).
	- Tracheal deviation
	- Severe cervical spine disease
	- Previous chest radiotherapy
	- Thoracic aortic aneurysm.
- **Intra-operative Requirements:**
	- 20-degree head-up position to reduce venous congestion.
	- Reinforced ETT recommended.
	- Avoid muscle relaxants.
	- Extubate when fully awake.
	- Multimodal analgesia for pain.
	- Postoperative chest X-ray (in recovery room) to check for pneumothorax.
- **Complications:**
	- Haemorrhage
	- Stroke
	- Air embolism
	- Nerve damage
	- Oesophageal tear
	- Thoracic duct injury
	- Tracheobronchial laceration.

### Mediastinal Masses in Children
- Increased risk for general anaesthesia with anterior mediastinal mass due to severe airway compromise.
- Children's softer tracheal cartilages are more prone to compression.
- Numerous reports of deaths under anaesthesia in children with mediastinal masses.
	- “Softer” trachea
	- Difficulty in obtaining an accurate history on positional symptoms
	- Inability to do awake fibre optic bronchoscopy in children.
- **Criteria for Acute Airway Compromise (Lam et al.):**
	- Airway narrowing/displacement on imaging.
	- Anterior tumour.
	- Lymphoma (on histology).
	- SVC obstruction signs and symptoms.
	- Radiologic evidence of vessel compression.
	- Pericardial effusion.
	- Pleural effusion.

**Techniques of Mediastinoscopy:**
- **History:**
	- First described by Harken in 1954.
	- Suprasternal approach developed by Carlens in 1959.
	- Anterior mediastinotomy approach by Chamberlain in 1966.
- **Purpose:**
	- Minimally invasive access to obtain biopsies of mediastinal lymph nodes and masses.
	- Mainly a diagnostic procedure.
- **Superior (Cervical) Mediastinoscopy:**
	- Not commonly used in children, but safe for those older than one year.
	- Small transverse incision in the suprasternal notch.
	- Scope advanced through pretracheal fascia to the mediastinum towards the carina.
		- anterior to trachea and posterior to aortic arch-lies in close proximity to several major vessels in the mediastinum.
	- Limited access to lymph nodes up to the level of the carina.
	- Successful thymus biopsy possible.
- **Anterior Mediastinotomy:**
	- Chamberlain’s procedure as an example.
	- Incision in the second or third intercostal space lateral to the sternum.
	- Access to anterior mediastinum, right paratracheal area, aorticopulmonary window.
- **Middle and Posterior Mediastinal Masses:**
	- Biopsied through thoracoscopy or thoracotomy.

**Contraindications to Superior Mediastinoscopy:**
- **Absolute:**
	- Anterior mediastinal masses
	- Inoperable tumours.
	- Previous recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
	- Severely debilitated patients.
	- Ascending aortic aneurysms
	- Previous mediastinoscopy.
- **Relative:**
	- Severe tracheal deviation
	- Cerebrovascular disease.
	- Superior vena cava syndrome
	- Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.

**Anaesthetic Implications:**
- **Superior Mediastinoscopy Patients:**
	- Present with mediastinal lymph nodes but no anterior mediastinal masses.
	- Risk of heart, great vessels, tracheobronchial tree compression under anaesthesia.
- **Chamberlain’s Procedure Patients:**
	- Range from asymptomatic to severe respiratory or cardiovascular compromise.
- **Anaesthetic Risks:**
	- Increased in patients with <50% trachea/bronchi narrowing on CT.
		- Symptoms like dyspnoea are good predictors of the degree of obstruction, with a good correlation between severity of symptoms and cross-sectional area of the airways
	- Severe risk of decompensation under anaesthesia due to compression effects.
**Effects of General Anaesthesia on Mediastinal Masses:**
- **Lung Volume Reduction:**
	- Caused by muscle relaxants and positive pressure ventilation.
	- Loss of inspiratory muscle tone and tethering effect of the expanded lung.
	- Reduction in transpleural pressure gradient(which distends the airway during spontaneous inspiration) leading to reduced airway caliber.
- **Diaphragm Movement:**
	- Moves caudad during spontaneous inspiration, pulling airways open.
	- Moves cephalic at end-expiration during positive pressure ventilation, compromising airways.
- **Gravity Effects:**
	- Tumor pulled onto great vessels and tracheobronchial tree.
	- Exaggerated in children due to increased chest wall compliance and smaller airway diameter.
- **Flow and Resistance:**
	- Small diameter airways in children have high airway resistance.
	- During positive pressure ventilation, turbulent flow increases resistance.
		- Poiseuille teaches that during laminar flow in a tube, resistance is inversely proportional to the radius to the power of four.
		- During positive pressure ventilation, laminar flow is disrupted and during subsequent turbulent flow, the pressure gradient that drives gas flow is proportional to the density of the gas.
	- Heliox (oxygen and helium mixture) used successfully with a laryngeal mask and spontaneous breathing to reduce resistance.
- **Spontaneous Ventilation Preference:**
	- Preferred in patients with mediastinal masses.
	- Higher oxygen demand and reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) in children predispose to faster desaturation.
	- CPAP during spontaneous ventilation helps maintain FRC.

**Disadvantages of Spontaneous Breathing During Superior Mediastinoscopy:**
- **Movement Risk:**
	- Child might move without muscle relaxant, risking injury to vital structures.
- **Air Embolism Risk:**
	- Head-up position reduces vascular engorgement but increases air embolism risk.
	- Tip of mediastinoscope exposed to pleural pressure, enhancing risk during venous bleeding.
	- Negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration increases risk of air embolism.
### Anaesthetic Management
**Preoperative:**
	- Aim to optimise respiratory and cardiovascular function.
	- Determine child’s nocturnal sleeping position
		- likely position to cause least compression of major structures
	- Thorough history and examination to detect:
		- SVC syndrome
		- Tracheobronchial compression
		- Compression of the heart or great vessels
		- Involvement of the myocardium
		- Cardiac tamponade
		- Complications of mediastinal masses
		- Complications generally associated with malignancies or chronic disease
	- Wheezing is often the only sign of tracheobronchial compression in small children.
	- A peripheral lymph node should always be sought.
		- This could be used for biopsy under local anaesthesia with sedation and will spare the patient a general anaesthetic with the associated risks.
	- The child should also be assessed for contraindications for the procedure.
**Special Investigations:**
- Full blood count with platelet count.
- Renal function and electrolytes.
- Blood gas analysis as indicated.
- Imaging: chest X-ray and contrast-enhanced CT scan.
	- Determine the size of the mass or lymph node involvement.
- MRI: better for nerve plexus and blood vessel involvement, especially for iodine allergy or thyroid tumours.
- Transthoracic echocardiography:
	- Assesses cardiac structure involvement
	- Dynamic information about:
		- Ventricle compression
		- SVC compression and compromise of the pulmonary outflow tract.
- Lung function tests: in supine and sitting positions for older children (controversial).
	- May reveal:
		- Distortion of the expiratory flow rate in intrathoracic obstruction
		- Distortion of inspiratory flow rate in extrathoracic obstruction
		- Equal reduction in inspiratory and expiratory flow rates in fixed lesions.
	- Others argue against the usefulness of lung function tests in the work-up of patients with mediastinal masses due to their poor correlation with the degree of obstruction.
**Biopsy and Treatment:**
- Urgent biopsies for conditions like Hodgkin lymphoma with rapid doubling time.
- Steroids and/or irradiation to shrink large tumours with significant cardio-respiratory compromise.
- Standard nil per os guidelines, prophylactic antibiotics, and blood products on standby.
- Sedative premedication best avoided in cardiovascular or respiratory compromised patients.
**Theatre Preparation:**
- Variety of reinforced endotracheal tubes, micro-laryngeal tubes, rigid bronchoscopes (different sizes)
- Competent surgeon for scope use.
- Perfusion technologists and CPB pump considered essential by some.
- CPB should be instituted electively if high risk of cardiovascular or tracheobronchial compression.
	- CPB cannot be successfully instituted in time in the event of sudden collapse.
**Patient Positioning:**
- Semi-sitting position often used, especially head-up (30°) for superior mediastinoscopy.
	- Supine position often exacerbates symptoms.
	- Head up position reduces vascular engorgement
		- Reduces the risk of vascular injury during surgery.
		- Added benefit of displacing the diaphragm in a more caudad direction during positive pressure ventilation
			- increases the risk of venous air embolism.
	- To enable access to the operative site, the trunk of the patient is often elevated and the neck extended, especially for superior mediastinoscopy.
- Prepare to change position for cardiovascular collapse or tracheobronchial obstruction.
- Preferred position determined preoperatively by the patient’s nocturnal sleeping position or lateral decubitus/prone positions.
**Monitoring:**
- Standard ASA monitoring, capnography, temperature monitoring.
- Depth of anaesthesia and neuromuscular transmission monitoring.
	- Adequate anaesthetic plane during maintenance with intravenous agents
	- Compromised patients where excessive inhalational agent concentration might further suppress cardiovascular function
- Neuromuscular transmission monitoring might prevent postoperative residual muscle relaxant effects, but is probably more important in adult patients with myasthenic effects of mediastinal malignancies.
- Urinary catheterisation usually not needed.
**Intravenous Access:**
- Obtain while patient is awake if possible.
- Two large-bore lines recommended for possible massive bleeding.
- IV lines in lower limbs for SVC syndrome.
- Central venous cannulas not routinely inserted; femoral vein preferred if needed.
- Arterial line:
	- If placed in the right radial artery during superior mediastinoscopy, the tracing may disappear or display false low readings, when the innominate artery is occluded.
	- Although this is a way of monitoring the patency of the innominate artery (to prevent cerebrovascular damage), it is preferable to insert the arterial line on the left (in order not to lose the trace) and to place a second saturation probe (apart from the one used to monitor saturation which should be on the left) on the right hand for monitoring the innominate artery.
**Local Anaesthesia:**
- Not indicated in most paediatric patients.
- Older children or moribund younger patients considered for local anaesthesia with sedation.
	- Benefits:
		- Safer in terms of cardiovascular and respiratory function
		- Reduces theatre times
		- Enables early detection of pneumothorax and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
- Awake fibre optic intubation with spontaneous ventilation for older children/adults.
**Induction and Maintenance of Anaesthesia:**
- Flexible bronchoscopy might precede mediastinoscopy and anaesthesia should be planned accordingly.
- Induction in semi-fowler or sitting position, maintaining spontaneous respiration and cardiovascular function.
- Use inhalational agents or ketamine (with anticholinergic agent).
	- Ketamine stimulates the formation of secretions which might further increase airway resistance in small or obstructed airways.
	- Ketamine may cause cardiovascular collapse in chronically ill patients with depleted catecholamine stores.
- Spraying of the vocal cords with lignocaine might aid the blunting of the intubation response if muscle relaxants not used and might reduce intraoperative coughing
	- Might result in postoperative aspiration due to inhibition of sensory innervation of the supraglottic airway.
- Intravenous induction is permitted in children with intravascular access in the absence of mediastinal masses.
- Intubation with care, especially with head and neck engorgement.
- Reinforced endotracheal tube recommended.
	- Used in patients with mediastinal masses to:
		- prevent the mass from occluding the airway and for superior mediastinoscopy
		- prevent the surgeon from occluding the tube while working in close proximity with the patient’s head
- Maintenance with spontaneous respiration preferred
	- Ketamine or inhalational agents
- Inhalational or intravenous techniques are used in patients where positive pressure ventilation is permitted.
- N2O avoided due to possible risk of procedure-related pneumothorax.
- Muscle relaxants optional but advisable if no compressing lesions.
	- Optimal operating conditions and to prevent sudden patient movement with injury to vital structures, especially during superior mediastinoscopy.
**Intraoperative Care:**
- Early identification and management of complications.
- Anterior mediastinotomy: visibility is better; less likelihood of injury to anatomical structures
	- Patients often present with complications of mediastinal masses.
- During superior mediastinoscopy, the scope is placed adjacent to a number of vital structures and massive bleeding from any of the major vessels (innominate artery, innominate vein azygos vein, aorta, bronchial artery, pulmonary artery etc) is possible.
- Emergency sternotomy or thoracotomy for massive bleeding.
- Additional intravenous access in the lower limbs for SVC injury.
- Possible complications:
	- pneumothorax
	- artery compression
	- oesophageal injury
	- tumour seeding
	- chilothorax
	- air embolism
	- dysrhythmias
		- pressure on the heart or great vessels
		- pulling on mediastinal structures
		- pericardial/pleural effusion
		- myocardial involvement of the malignancy
	- negative pressure pulmonary oedema.
		- deep inspiratory efforts against obstructed airways which generate large negative pressures (mainly seen in adults)
	- Analgesia:
		- minimally invasive procedure
		- intraand postoperative analgesic requirements limited to balanced pharmacological analgesic regimens in conjunction with local infiltration of wound sites.
**Postoperative Care:**
- Extubation in theatre, nurse in head-up position.
	- reduces venous engorgement
- They may experience worsening of obstruction caused by:
	- swelling
	- increase in turbulent air flow due to:
		- pain
		- coughing
		- tachypnoea
		- anxiety.
- Complications proportional to tumour size.
- Potential issues:
	- bleeding
	- hemiparesis
		- following inraoperative carotid artery compression
	- recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
		- vocal cord paralysis
			- stridor
			- airway compromise
	- phrenic nerve injury
		- respiratory compromise
	- Infection.
# Techniques for Single Lung Ventilation in Infants and Children

## Introduction

- **Advancements in Technology and Equipment:**
	- Significant progress in thoracic surgery for infants and children.
	- Emphasis on minimally invasive methods.
	- Parallel advancements in pediatric airway equipment.
- **Pediatric Airway Equipment:**
	- Development of pediatric-sized bronchial blockers, Univent tubes, and double lumen tubes.
	- Lung isolation possible in pediatric patients, including full-term neonates.
- **Regional Differences in Lung Isolation Use:**
	- Variability in lung isolation techniques among different centers.
	- Some centers frequently use lung isolation for thoracic procedures.
	- Other centers rarely use lung isolation in infants and children.
- **Surgical Techniques:**
	- Both open and minimally invasive thoracic surgeries can be performed without lung isolation.
	- Lung deflation improves surgical conditions and visualization of thoracic structures.
### Diseases of the Chest Requiring Lung Isolation for Surgery

**Neonates and Infants:**
- **Congenital Anomalies:**
	- Tracheal stenosis
	- Pulmonary sequestration
	- Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
	- Tracheoesophageal fistula
	- Congenital lobar emphysema
	- Vascular ring
- **Diagnosis:**
	- Many diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound.
	- Lack of prenatal care can result in post-delivery diagnosis with severe respiratory distress.

**Children and Adolescents:**
- **Common Thoracic Diseases:**
	- Infection
	- Malignancy
	- Musculoskeletal deformities
- **Anterior Mediastinal Mass:**
	- Potential for complete airway compression.
	- Risk of cardiovascular collapse under general anesthesia.
**Anesthesia Considerations:**
- Understanding the patient’s underlying anatomy.
- Recognizing how anatomical distortions affect respiratory and cardiac physiology.
### Physiology of Single Lung Ventilation and the Lateral Decubitus Position in Infants and Children

**V/Q Matching in Upright Position:**
- In spontaneously breathing patients, ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) are greatest in the dependent regions due to gravity.
- This results in well-matched V/Q and maximal oxygenation.

**Factors Impairing V/Q Matching During Thoracic Surgery:**
1. **Decreased Functional Residual Capacity (FRC):**
	- Causes:
		- general anesthesia
		- neuromuscular blockade
		- mechanical ventilation.
1. **Surgical Retraction or Single Lung Ventilation:**
	- Results in collapse of the operative lung.
2. **Impairment of Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV):**
	- Caused by inhalational agents and other anesthetic drugs.

**Effects of the Lateral Decubitus Position:**
**Older Children and Adults:**
- Optimal V/Q matching with the "healthy" lung in the dependent position.
- Increased perfusion to the "healthy," dependent lung.
- Decreased perfusion to the diseased, non-dependent lung.
	- As the diseased lung has impaired ventilation at baseline, this preferential distribution of blood flow away from the diseased lung results in optimal V/Q matching.
- This position is beneficial for both spontaneous and controlled ventilation.
**Infants <12 months:**
- Optimal oxygenation with the "healthy" lung in the non-dependent position.
- Positioning for surgery is opposite of optimal oxygenation.
**Reasons for Different Effects in Infants:**
1. **Easily Compressible Rib Cage:**
	- Cannot fully support the dependent lung.
	- Predisposes to atelectasis of the dependent lung at normal tidal breathing.
2. **Reduced Hydrostatic Pressure Gradient:**
	- Less difference in perfusion between dependent and non-dependent lungs.
	- Beneficial increase in perfusion to the dependent lung is diminished.
3. **Reduced Functional Advantage of Dependent Diaphragm:**
	- In older children and adults, the dependent diaphragm has a mechanical advantage as it is “loaded” by the abdominal hydrostatic pressure gradient.
	- This pressure gradient is significantly decreased in infants, thereby reducing the functional advantage of the dependent diaphragm
**Risks for Infants:**
- Higher risk of developing hypoxemia during surgery in the lateral decubitus position compared to older children and adults.
### Techniques for Lung Isolation in Infants and Children

**Manual Retraction:**
- Used in open thoracotomy and Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS).
- Allows dual lung ventilation with a standard endotracheal tube.
- Two lung ventilation during VATS is less desirable than single lung ventilation due to:
	- better visualization
	- more space for equipment
	- decreased lung injury from retractors.

**Single Lumen Endotracheal Tubes (ETT):**
- Simple method for lung isolation.
- ETT advanced into the mainstem bronchus until breath sounds on the operative side disappear.
- Right mainstem bronchus easier to intubate due to less acute angulation (25 degress vs 45 degrees respectively)
- Left mainstem intubation facilitated by rotating the ETT bevel (90-180 degrees) and turning the patient's head to the right (helps align the trachea and left mainstem bronchus).
- When using a cuffed ETT, the distance from the tip of the tube to the proximal cuff must be shorter than the length of the bronchus in order to ensure the entire cuff is within the bronchus and the upper lobe orifice is unobstructed.
**Advantages:**
- No special airway equipment required (fibreoptic bronchoscope, etc)
- Ideal for emergency situations due to ease of technique and setup.
**Disadvantages:**
- Inadequate bronchial seal, especially with uncuffed tubes.
- Operative lung may remain somewhat inflated.
- Non-operative lung susceptible to contamination (haemorrhage or infection).
- Inability to suction or provide CPAP to the operative lung.
- Possible obstruction of the upper lobe bronchus, especially when shorter right mainstem is intubated.
- Significant manipulation needed to transition back to dual lung ventilation.
	- Can be challenging if this is required mid surgery when the patient’s airway is difficult to access

**Balloon-Tipped Bronchial Blockers:**
- Examples: Arndt endobronchial blocker, Fogarty embolectomy catheter, Cohen endobronchial blocker, Coopdech bronchial blocker, EZ-blocker.
- Blocker placed within or next to a single lumen ETT and advanced under direct visualization using a fiberoptic bronchoscope into the mainstem bronchus of the operative lung.
	- Cuff inflated under direct vision to ensure adequate positioning and seal of bronchus.
- Arndt endobronchial blocker is common in the pediatric population.
- Placement steps:
	1. Single lumen endotracheal tube placed at midtracheal position.
	2. Blocker placed through multi-port adapter.
	3. Fiberoptic bronchoscope placed through multiport adapter and advanced through wire-loop of blocker.
	4. Coupled bronchoscope and blocker advanced to the side of the lung to be blocked (A).
	5. Once in mainstem bronchus, bronchoscope is withdrawn and the cuff inflated under direct vision (B).
	6. Fiberoptic bronchoscope removed entirely.
	7. Wire loop can be retracted so that open-tipped blocker can be utilized for suction or CPAP.

![[B1CED684-A824-4AE0-86FA-C2586C811B54.jpeg]]

- The smallest sized Arndt endobronchial blocker available is 5 French with an outer diameter of 2.5mm.
- The smallest fiberoptic bronchoscope available is typically ~ 2.2mm, therefore the smallest endotracheal tube (ETT) through which the blocker can be placed is 5mm ID.
	- For pediatric patients who require smaller ETTs, the blocker can be placed external to and alongside the single lumen ETT.
**Advantages:**
- Complete bronchial seal provides more predictable lung collapse.
- Easy transition from single to dual lung ventilation.
**Disadvantages:**
- Blockers can migrate proximally into the trachea, impeding ventilation to both lungs, causing acute hypoxemia.
- Many blockers are "close-tipped," preventing suction or CPAP to the operative lung.
- Challenging to position for those with limited experience.

**Univent Tubes:**
- **Methodology:**
	- Similar to bronchial blockers for lung isolation.
- **Structure:**
	- Standard endotracheal tube with an additional lumen attached to the side.
	- Additional lumen contains a balloon-tipped tube that acts as a bronchial blocker.
- **Dimensions:**
	- Discrepancy between internal diameter of the endotracheal tube and the total outer diameter.
	- Example: Univent tube with 3.5mm internal diameter has an external cross-sectional diameter of 7.5-8.0mm.
- **Gas Flow:**
	- High resistance to gas flow due to the large cross-sectional area.

![[32403D01-07E4-4ABE-A9DF-785B616209A4.jpeg]]

**Advantages:**
- Positioning of the blocker more secure compared to a standard bronchial blocker:
	- it's attached to the main endotracheal tube
		- blocker dislodgement is less frequent
- Most of the Univent blocker tubes have an open lumen at the end, which allows for suction or CPAP to the operative lung
**Disadvantages:**
- Low volume, high-pressure blocker balloons can cause mucosal injury.
- High resistance to gas flow due to the large cross-sectional area occupied by the blocker channel.

**Double Lumen Tubes (DLTs):**
- Consist of two cuffed tubes of differing lengths molded together.
- Shorter tube ends in the trachea, longer tube in either bronchus.
- After the tip of the tube is passed through the vocal cords, the stylet is removed, and the tube is then rotated 90 degrees to the appropriate side and advanced further into the bronchus until resistance is met.
- Verification with auscultation and fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
- Smallest size available is 26 French, suitable for pediatric patients as young as 8 years old.
**Advantages:**
- Ease of placement for left-sided DLT.
- Ability to suction and apply CPAP to the operative lung.
- Ability to visualize the operative lung.
**Disadvantages:**
- Right-sided DLTs are difficult to place without obstructing the right upper lobe bronchus.
- Need to change to a single lumen ETT for postoperative mechanical ventilation.
	- Disadvantage in patients with a known difficult airway or in prolonged operations in which the airway may be edematous making reintubation challenging.

### Sizing of Tubes Used for Single Lung Ventilation

- The table below shows the recommended sizing of each of the techniques described above, according to the age of the infant or child.
	- Correct sizing will vary between patients of the same age and so it is essential to have a range of sizes available.

![[958F7FF1-DC21-45EB-9BA5-31684DF1E812.jpeg]]

### Troubleshooting Hypoxemia During Single Lung Ventilation

- **General Considerations:**
	- Single lung ventilation creates a large intrapulmonary shunt due to non-ventilated lung perfusion.
	- Some degree of desaturation is expected.
	- Patients with chronic lung disease of the operative lung tolerate single lung ventilation better than patients with two healthy lungs.
	- Chronic lung disease leads to decreased perfusion in the diseased lung, reducing shunt fraction during single lung ventilation.
- **Steps to Evaluate and Treat Hypoxemia:**
	1. Place patient on 100% FIO2.
	2. Evaluate tube/blocker position:
		- Auscultate for breath sounds.
		- Use fiberoptic bronchoscopy if available.
		- Verify tube/blocker placement after every patient repositioning.
	3. Apply CPAP to the non-dependent lung:
		- Use 5-10 mmHg CPAP to decrease shunt fraction without interfering with surgical conditions.
	4. Apply low levels of PEEP to the dependent lung:
		- Avoid high levels of PEEP to prevent blood flow diversion from the dependent lung.
	5. Pass soft suction catheter down the tube:
		- Ensure no obstruction from secretions.
	6. If hypoxemia persists:
		- Inform the surgeon.
		- Re-inflate the operative lung.
# Paediatric Lung Isolation
**Indications for One-Lung Ventilation:**
- **Prevention of Contamination:**
	- From hemorrhage or infection.
- **Control of Ventilation Distribution:**
	- Due to:
		- bronchopulmonary fistula
		- lung cyst
		- bullae
		- severe hypoxemia from unilateral lung disease.
- **Extensive Bronchopulmonary Lavage:**
	- May require lung isolation.
- **Surgical Exposure:**
	- For lung resections, mediastinal exposure, and thoracoscopy, often achievable without lung isolation in patients <2 years old using CO2 pneumothorax and lung retraction.

### ABCDs of Pediatric Lung Isolation

- **A - Anatomy:**
	- Differences between pediatric and adult airways.
	- Smaller size of pediatric airway necessitates a range of airway devices.
	- Double-lumen tube (DLT) not suitable for infants and small children.
- **B - Bronchoscopy:**
	- Choosing appropriate bronchoscope size:
		- Must fit physically:
			- In order for a well-lubricated bronchoscope to physically fit inside the lumen of the TT (and not seize up from friction), the OD of the bronchoscope (ODB) needs to be <90% of the ID of the TT (IDTT).
				- ODB/IDTT < 0.9.
		- Must allow ventilation:
			- Cross-sectional area of the bronchoscope (CSAB) cannot take up more that 50% of the cross-sectional area of the TT lumen (CSATT)
			- ODB/IDTT < 0.7.
	- Smallest commonly used fiberoptic scope is Olympus BF N20 (2.2 mm OD).
		- Placing this scope through a 2.5 SLT gives an ODB/IDTT ratio of 2.2/2.5 or 0.88. Since this ratio is <0.9 but >0.7, the bronchoscope will physically fit inside the TT, but no ventilation will be able to occur.
	- Care must be taken during the selection and use of a bronchoscope. Bronchoscopes can become deformed from repeated use and cleaning, and the tip may have a larger diameter than documented.
	- Test fit of bronchoscope in tracheal tube before patient use.
	- During bronchoscopy, even if the CSA ratio is <50%, there will be an increase in airway resistance and a decrease in ventilation. A sick patient can quickly decompensate during bronchoscopy due to inadequate ventilation.

![[0EED7C09-022F-4796-92F8-F28289C76863.jpeg]]

- **C - Chest Imaging:**
	- Review all available chest X-rays and CT scans preoperatively.
	- Identify issues like narrowed distal trachea or compressed bronchus.
	- Use CT scans to assist in choosing appropriate tracheal tube size.
	- Ultrasound measurements of the upper trachea may help predict pediatric TT sizing.
- **D - Diameter of Pediatric Airway:**
	- Neonatal trachea anteroposterior diameter ~4.3 mm.
	- Trachea grows to ~14 mm by age 15 (female) and 16–18 mm by age 19 (male).
	- Trachea is elliptical; use smaller (anteroposterior) diameter for device sizing.
	- Mainstem bronchi diameters estimated as 0.66 (left) or 0.86 (right) of tracheal diameter.

### Options for Lung Isolation (see above Summary for OLV)

#### Single-lumen Tracheal Tube (SLT)
- **Preferred method for ages:** 0–6 months
- **Acceptable method for ages:** 0–18 years
- **Description:**
	- Simplest option for lung isolation by placing SLT into the desired bronchus.
	- Most common for very young patients.
	- Easier placement in the right mainstem bronchus due to less acute angle.
	- Flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy aids in placement.
- **Advantages:**
	- Simple and quick mainstem intubation.
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Potential for inadequate collapse of the operative lung.
	- Inability to suction the operative lung or deliver continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
	- Limited ventilation in the right upper lobe when the right mainstem bronchus is intubated.
- **Alternative:**
	- Two SLTs placed in parallel for independent lung ventilation; limited in pediatrics due to smaller anatomy size relative to TT size.
#### Bronchial Blockers
- **Preferred method for ages:** 2–8 years (coaxial technique)
- **Preferred method for ages:** 6 months–2 years (parallel technique)
- **Acceptable method for ages:** 6 months–18 years
- **Types:**
	- **Vascular Balloon Catheters (e.g., Fogarty, Miller):**
		- Used successfully for lung isolation.
		- Variety of sizes available.
		- Removable guide wire for angling the tip.
		- Placement facilitated with fibreoptic bronchoscope.
		- Low-volume, high-pressure balloon; fibreoptic bronchoscope required to avoid mucosal damage.
		- No central channel for deflation or CPAP.
		- **Miller Atrioseptostomy Catheter:**
			- Angled tip for directing to desired bronchus.
			- High-pressure balloon, no central channel.
	- **Uniblocker Tube (Fuji Systems):**
		- 5 Fr size suitable for children up to 8 years.
		- Stiff shaft and angled tip for positioning.
		- Swivel connector allows ventilation during placement.
		- Balloon cuff (maximum 3 ml) with lower pressure system to decrease risk of bronchial mucosal injury.
		- No central lumen for CPAP or suctioning.
#### Arndt Blockers
- **Type:** 5 Fr Arndt paediatric bronchial blocker
- **Features:**
	- Balloon tip with a four-way adapter and swivel connector.
	- 2 ml cuff with lower inflation pressures.
	- Inner lumen with flexible nylon wire loop for positioning over the bronchoscope.
	- Central lumen usable for suctioning and CPAP once nylon wire is removed.
	- Reattachment of the nylon guide is not possible after removal, complicating repositioning.
#### Cuff Pressures for Bronchial Blockers
- **High-Pressure Balloons:** Fogarty and atrial septostomy catheters.
	- Cuff pressures: Fogarty (710 cm H2O), Miller (690 cm H2O) with 2 ml air.
- **Lower-Pressure Balloons:**
	- 5 Fr Arndt (340 cm H2O) and 5 Fr Fuji Uniblocker (330 cm H2O) with 2 ml air.
	- Prefer lower pressure blockers to minimize bronchial trauma.
	- Use fibreoptic bronchoscopy to ensure minimal inflation volumes for sealing.
#### Sizing of Bronchial Blockers and Bronchoscopes for SLTs
- **Principles:**
	- Two sizes commonly used in pediatrics: 5 Fr (1.67 mm OD) and 7 Fr (2.33 mm OD).
	- For coaxial technique, combined OD of blocker and bronchoscope should be <90% of TT ID: (ODBB + ODB) / IDTT < 0.9.
	- Cross-sectional area of TT lumen blocked should be <50%.
	- Ensure ventilation during bronchoscopy; sick patients require careful monitoring due to increased resistance and decreased ventilation.
- **Smallest SLT for Coaxial Technique:**
	- Smallest fibreoptic scope OD: 2.2 mm.
	- Smallest bronchial blocker OD: 1.67 mm (5 Fr).
	- Smallest SLT ID: 4.5 (ratio 0.86) for patients as young as 2 years.
- **Bronchial Blocker for Patients <2 Years:**
	- Use parallel technique with bronchoscope inside TT lumen.
	- Place bronchial blocker through glottis into trachea, then intubate alongside with SLT.
	- 3.5 or 4.0 TT with 5 Fr bronchial blocker outside TT typically tolerated for ages 6 months–2 years.
	- Microcuff TT may reduce air leak.
	- Extra space in elliptical shaped trachea allows for bronchial blocker placement alongside TT.

![[F083121E-D38D-4A1D-9549-2B3A01FB8960.jpeg]]

#### Coaxial Vs Parallel Technique
- **Coaxial Technique:** Arndt bronchial blocker is effective.
- **Parallel Technique:** Prefer blockers with a stiffer shaft and angled tip.
	- Suitable options: 5 Fr Fuji Uniblocker, 5 Fr Fogarty embolectomy catheter, 5 Fr Miller atrioseptostomy catheter.
#### Univent Tube
- **Preferred method for ages:** 6–8 years
- **Acceptable method for ages:** 6–18 years
- **Description:**
	- TT with a bronchial blocker within a separate lumen.
	- Bronchial blocker can be deflated and withdrawn into the tracheal lumen for double-lung ventilation.
	- Balloon at the distal end of the smaller lumen reduces dislodgement risk.
	- Available in pediatric sizes: 3.5 and 4.5 mm ID; larger sizes have an additional channel for CPAP and suctioning.
	- Fibreoptic bronchoscope required for positioning.
- **Advantages:**
	- Reduces risk of bronchial blocker dislodgement.
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Smaller cross-sectional diameter of ventilation lumen increases airway resistance.
	- Limits the size of the fibreoptic bronchoscope for positioning.
	- Not suitable for children under 6 years.
- **Age Range Suitability:**
	- Preferred for 6-8 years.
	- Suitable for 6-18 years but may be omitted due to narrow preferred age range and availability of other tools.
#### Double-lumen Tube (DLT)
- **Preferred method for ages:** 8–18 years
- **Acceptable method for ages:** 8–18 years
- **Description:**
	- Considered the gold standard for lung isolation.
	- Composed of two lumens fused in parallel; one angled and longer for the bronchus, the other for the trachea.
	- Both lumens cuffed for single-lung or double-lung ventilation by clamping/releasing adapter limb.
	- Sizing formula: Size = Age × 1.5 + 14.
	- Smallest size: 26 Fr, suitable for 8–10 years (≥30 kg and ≥130 cm).
	- Post age 16, size varies by sex and height.
- **Sizing Recommendations:**
	- Females <1.6 m: 35 Fr.
	- Females >1.6 m: 37 Fr.
	- Males <1.7 m: 39 Fr.
	- Males >1.7 m: 41 Fr.
- **Insertion:**
	- Left-sided DLTs preferred to avoid obstructing right upper-lobe bronchus.
	- Inserted by direct laryngoscopy or fibreoptic scope/tube exchanger in difficult airways.
	- Rotate 90° into desired bronchus after passing vocal cords.
	- Confirm placement with fibreoptic bronchoscopy or auscultation.
- **Advantages:**
	- Quick alternation between single and double-lung ventilation.
	- Ease of CPAP application and suctioning.
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Size limitations for pediatric patients.
	- More challenging for difficult airways.
	- Deflate bronchial cuff when lung isolation not needed to avoid mucosal injury.
	- Replace with SLT if postoperative intubation and ventilation required to prevent trauma to the tracheal-bronchial tree.

# Paediatric Bronchoscopy
#### General Considerations
- Requires special equipment and knowledge of paediatric airway anatomy, physiology, and pathology.
- Preferably performed in a tertiary referral centre.
- Essential for excellent communication between anaesthetist and endoscopist to maintain adequate oxygenation.
#### Infant Anatomy and Physiology
- Large tongue, longer and narrower epiglottis angled posteriorly.
- Obligatory nasal breathers until 5 months.
- Ex-premature infants <60 weeks post-conceptual age have increased apnoea risk.
- Softer, higher, and easily displaced larynx.
- Narrowest part of upper airway is the cricoid ring.
- Short cricothyroid membrane, complicating needle cricothyroidotomy.
- Fixed tidal volume in young infants, requiring increased ventilatory frequency.
- Diaphragmatic ventilation, fewer type I muscle fibres, leading to early fatigue.
- Lower functional residual capacity than closing capacity due to low elastic recoil.
- Higher metabolic requirements predispose infants and children to hypoxia.
#### Indications for Bronchoscopy
- Used for a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, from common (e.g., airway obstruction assessment) to rare (e.g., laser removal of tumours, tracheal stents insertion).
- Indications for bronchoscopy
	- Diagnostic  
		- Airway obstruction (e.g. tracheomalacia,bronchomalacia)
		- Persistent/recurrent pneumonia
		- Tracheo-oesophageal fistula
		- Brushings for cytology
		- Transbronchial biopsy for histology
		- Failure to wean from ventilator
		- Haemoptysis
	- Therapeutic  
		- Removal of foreign body
		- Suctioning mucus plugs (e.g. in cystic fibrosis)
		- Facilitate endobronchial intubation for one lung anaesthesia  
		- Laser therapy  
		- Balloon dilatation of trachea/bronchus Stent insertion
#### Bronchoscopes
- **Types:** Flexible and rigid (ventilating and Venturi).
- Advances in metal alloys and fibreoptic technology have enabled paediatric use.
#### Storz Ventilating Bronchoscope
- **Commonly used in children for both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.**
- **Structure:**
	- Light metal tube with removable optical telescope.
	- Ventilation via annular space between bronchoscope lumen and telescope outer surface.
	- Distal port for anaesthetic breathing system (usually a Jackson Rees T-piece) attachment, suction channel, and light prism.
- **Size Selection:**
	- Size refers to nominal internal diameter (ID); actual ID is larger.
	- Outer diameter (OD) is crucial to avoid tracheal mucosa compression and oedema.
	- Correct size allows an audible leak at 20 cm H2O pressure.
- **Available Lengths:** 20 and 30 cm.
	- Resistance increases with scope length.

![[AF4BDF8F-EB56-4DE1-BB44-8C25466B2283 1.jpeg]]

#### Venturi Bronchoscopes
- **Structure:** Open-ended metal tubes.
- **Function:**
	- Gas exchange by jet insufflation using a Sanders injector.
	- Anaesthesia maintenance via intravenous methods.
- **Limitations:**
	- Cannot deliver inhalational agents or monitor gas delivery.
	- Higher risk of carbon dioxide retention and barotrauma.
	- Suitable for patients >40 kg.
#### Fibreoptic Bronchoscopes
- **Introduction:** 1966.
- **Structure:**
	- Bundles of fibreoptic fibres with magnifying lens system.
	- Tip can be angulated using a steering wheel.
	- Includes suction and injection ports.
- **Function:**
	- Spontaneous ventilation occurs around the instrument.
	- Nasal or oral introduction, typically under local anaesthesia with or without sedation.
	- Smaller diameter facilitates access to distal airways.
	- Greater field of vision compared to rigid bronchoscopes.
- **Smallest General Use Model:** Olympus BF N20.
	- ED 1.8 mm distally, 2.2 mm proximally.
	- Tip angulation: 160° up, 90° down.
	- Lacks suction port.
### Anaesthetic Considerations for Paediatric Bronchoscopy

#### Preoperative Assessment
- Examine previous anaesthetic charts to answer the following questions:
	- Could the larynx be visualised
	- Airway obstruction in any particular position during induction
	- Size of endotracheal tube and bronchoscope used
	- Difficulty oxygenating during bronchoscopy
	- Postoperative stridor occurrence
- Discuss with patient and parents to understand the underlying diagnosis and symptom variation.
	- How symptoms vary in relation to position, crying and feeding
- Stridor present during inspiration suggests an extrathoracic obstruction.
- Stridor in expiration: intrathoracic cause is likely.
- A past medical history of lung disease of prematurity may predispose the patient to barotrauma.
- Examination focuses on airway and respiratory system.
	- Anatomical abnormalities may dictate the type of bronchoscopy (e.g. deformities of the cervical spine or possible spinal instability may warrant a fibreoptic scope).
- Consider specific investigations (e.g., chest X-ray to localise inhaled foreign body, CT scan to evaluate possible cause for obstruction).
#### Premedication
- **Older children:** Oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg, max 20 mg) 30 min before induction.
	- There shouldn't be evidence of airway obstruction or respiratory embarrassment.
- **Anticholinergic:** Given IV at induction to prevent bradycardia and improve local anaesthesia efficacy due to antisialogogue effects.
	- Also decreases amount if suctioning required during endoscopy.
- **Dexamethasone:** 0.6 mg/kg (max 12 mg IV) to minimize airway oedema if airway is narrowed.
#### Preparation
- Availability of a variety of tracheal tubes, laryngoscopes, and bronchoscopes.
- Standard monitoring; capnography limited to spot checks.
#### General Anaesthesia Techniques
- **Bronchoscopy using ventilating bronchoscope:**
	- Can be used with spontaneous or controlled breathing.
	- Local anaesthesia (1–2% lidocaine), max 4mg/kg to:
		- Prevent laryngospasm
		- Prevent coughing
		- Reduce general anaesthetic requirements
	- Intubation before bronchoscopy to estimate bronchoscope size.
		- avoids unnecessary trauma.
	- Position patient supine with neck extended.
		- Rolled towel across the back between the scapulae to extend the neck and push the upper trachea forward
	- Sevoflurane for induction and spontaneous respiration via Jackson Rees T-piece attached to side port of bronchoscope.
	- Insertion of telescope into bronchoscope seals distal end and decreases cross-sectional area of lumen
		- increases work of breathing, especially in infants.
	- Neuromuscular blocking agent use:
		- Ventilate manually provided the telescope is in place.
		- Even with assisted ventilation, hypercarbia leading to respiratory acidosis can be a problem because the expiratory pressure generated by passive elastic recoil of chest and lung may be insufficient to expel air through the smallest scopes.
			- Air trapping will occur unless a ventilation pattern with a long time constant is used; 5–10 s expirations may be required.
#### Apnoeic Technique for Premature Infants
- Mild hyperventilation with 100% oxygen before telescope insertion.
- Ensure expiratory limb is open to prevent hyperinflation.
	- oxygen continues to be delivered at 1 litre/min.
- Apnoea is limited by accumulation of carbon dioxide and the presence of co-morbidity (e.g. lung disease of prematurity)
- Monitor for accumulation of CO2 and patient deterioration (bradycardia).
#### Specific Considerations for Infants
- **Premature infants (1–2 kg):** Size 2.5 bronchoscope, use apnoeic technique to avoid barotrauma (due to very high intrapulmonary pressure)
- **Infants <1 kg:** Telescope (OD 2.7 mm) alone, maintain anaesthesia via nasopharyngeal insufflation or apnoeic technique.
	- Infant breathing spontaneously around telescope
#### Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA)
- Used in some hospitals with propofol ± remifentanil.
- Provides good airway reflex suppression, rapid emergence, and decreased pollution.
- Suitable for children as young as 3 days old.
- Analgesia: Paracetamol suppository is adequate.
- In older children this could be given as an oral premedication.
- Postoperatively, the patient should remain nil by mouth for 2 h after local anaesthetic spray.
#### Fibreoptic Bronchoscopy
- Mainly used for diagnosis and aid to intubation in difficult airways.
- **Technique:**
	- Insert laryngeal mask after induction while maintaining spontaneous ventilation with oxygen and sevoflurane.
	- Pass fibreoptic scope through laryngeal mask and apply local anaesthetic via injection port.
	- Steer tip of scope into trachea.
	- Larger scopes can pass through LMA than tracheal tubes.
- **Disadvantage:** LMA may cause vocal cords to appear immobile.
### Complications of Paediatric Bronchoscopy

#### Trauma
- **Common Sites:**
	- Lips
	- Teeth
	- Base of tongue (often injured by inexperienced endoscopists)
	- Epiglottis
	- Larynx
- **Tracheobronchial Tree Damage:**
	- Rare but includes pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and surgical emphysema.
- **Haemorrhage:**
	- Usually minor and resolves spontaneously.
#### Hypoxia
- **Causes:**
	- Scope placement in a bronchus despite side ports.
	- Excessive suctioning removing gases, including oxygen, causing increased atelectasis.
	- Bronchospasm from tracheobronchial tree irritation.
- **Management:**
	- Repeatedly withdraw the scope if hypoxia occurs.
	- Minimize suctioning to prevent atelectasis.
#### Hypercarbia
- **Causes:**
	- Air trapping due to resistance during passive expiration.
- **Consequences:**
	- Barotrauma
	- Diminished venous return
	- Reduced cardiac output
#### Pneumothorax
- **Risk Factors:**
	- Dilating a stenosis
	- Transbronchial biopsy
- **Management:**
	- Perform chest X-ray post-procedure before leaving the post-anaesthetic area.
#### Bradycardia
- **Primary Cause:**
	- Assume secondary to hypoxia until proven otherwise.
#### Stridor
- **Cause:**
	- Subglottic oedema.
- **Management:**
	- Nebulized epinephrine 1:1000 (0.5 ml/kg, max 5 ml per administration).
	- Repeat dose as needed due to transient vasoconstricting effect.
	- IV dexamethasone for sustained relief (1–2 hours to act).
	- Re-intubation may be necessary.
#### Other Issues
- **Epistaxis:**
	- Occurs when fibreoptic scope is inserted nasally.
- **Infection Risk:**
	- Potential transmission due to difficulty in sterilizing scope
### Removal of Inhaled Foreign Body: Summary

#### Presentation
- **Symptoms:**
	- Can range from complete obstruction with hypoxia and cardiac arrest to partial obstruction with coughing, wheezing, stridor, and dyspnoea.
- **History:**
	- Commonly immediate presentation, but up to 30% can present later (over a week) due to initial asymptomatic period.
	- Even if undistressed, patients should be admitted for observation and early bronchoscopy due to risk of subsequent complete obstruction.
#### Diagnosis
- **Chest X-ray:**
	- Often normal as most foreign bodies are radiolucent.
	- Positive history and clinical signs may be sufficient for endoscopy.
	- Inspiration and expiration chest X-rays can aid in locating the foreign body and showing any atelectasis, pneumonia, or air trapping.
	- **Note:** Avoid nitrous oxide if air trapping is present.
- **Medication:**
	- Anticholinergics and possibly anti-aspiration premedication recommended.
- **Team:**
	- Requires two anaesthetists for management.
#### Procedure
- **Bronchoscope:**
	- Typically, a Storz bronchoscope is used; some hospitals use a fibreoptic bronchoscope with a Dormia basket.
- **Technique:**
	- Deep anaesthesia followed by introducing the rigid bronchoscope into the trachea to control the airway, reducing the risk of moving a proximal foreign body distally.
	- Special grasping forceps with a collar for the Hopkins rod optical telescope provide excellent visual conditions.
- **Ventilation:**
	- Preserve spontaneous respiration; use sevoflurane in 100% oxygen and topical anaesthesia.
	- Maintain gentle assisted ventilation to avoid driving the foreign body distally.
	- Hypoxia and hypoventilation are more common and dangerous than the rare complication of driving the foreign body distally.
	- Stomach emptying reduces aspiration risk.
	- IV induction and neuromuscular blocking agents only if no air trapping is present to avoid barotrauma.
- **Foreign Body Extraction:**
	- Small dose of neuromuscular blocking agent or propofol aids extraction through the cords.
	- Post-extraction examination for a second foreign body is crucial.
	- Large foreign bodies may occlude the trachea during withdrawal; may need to push it back into the main bronchus or perform a tracheotomy if extraction via the larynx is impossible.
- **Post-Procedure:**
	- Insert tracheal tube if a full stomach is a concern.
	- Wake and extubate patient once protective reflexes return.
