# Introduction

Unmanaged acute pain in paediatric patients can have long-term adverse effects on various systems and behaviours. These include heightened pain sensitivity, impaired immune function, altered neurophysiological responses, negative attitudes, and avoidance behaviour in relation to health care.

## Development of Pain Pathways

- Paediatric patients have an immature nervous system, characterized by widened receptive fields, lower sensory discrimination, and reduced inhibitory pathways. This results in heightened sensitivity to noxious stimuli.
- Neural pathways for nociception are present from birth, including in premature infants. However, neurotransmitters and receptor-mediated systems vary in expression depending on developmental age. The response to noxious stimuli is influenced by the maturity level of the central nervous system.
- Peripheral C fibres are fully developed, but their cortical connections at the dorsal horn remain immature.
- A-beta fibres have extended connections within the spinal cord and can contribute to nociceptive signalling from lower-intensity stimuli. These fibres retract once C-fibres fully mature.
- Due to this immature connection, paediatric patients demonstrate less distinction between noxious and non-noxious stimuli.
- Inhibitory pathways in the spinal cord are not fully developed during early life, which contributes to an enhanced perception of pain.
# Paediatric Assessment Tools

## Self-Reported Tools
### Visual Analogue Scale (Was)

- Suitable for ages 3 years to adult.
- Used to measure pain intensity.
- A horizontal line with endpoints labelled "no pain" and "worst possible pain." The patient marks a point on the line corresponding to their perceived pain intensity.
### Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale

- Applicable for ages 3 to 18 years.
- Commonly used for assessing acute pain.
- Consists of six faces with expressions ranging from "no pain" to "worst pain." Each face is assigned a numerical value and includes descriptors like "no hurt" or "hurts a lot."

### Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R)

- Suitable for acute pain assessment in children aged 4 to 16 years.
- Depicts six cartoon faces, ranging from a neutral expression to one of severe pain. Faces are numbered 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 to reflect increasing pain intensity.
### Poker Chip Tool

- Used for pain intensity measurement in children aged 4 to 7 years.
- The child is given four poker chips and selects the number of chips that represent their level of pain, with one chip indicating a "little hurt" and all four chips representing "the most hurt a child could have."
## Observational Pain Assessment Measures by Child's Age

|Child's Age|Measure|
|---|---|
|Newborn to 3 yr|COMFORT or FLACC|
|4 years|FPS-R + COMFORT or FLACC|
|5–7 years|FPS-R|
|> 7 years|Was or NRS or FPS-R|

**Abbreviations:**

- **FPS-R**: Faces Pain Scale Revised
- **NRS**: Numerical Rating Scale
- **Was**: Visual Analog Scale

### Revised FLACC Score for Pain Assessment (2 Months - 16 years)
- 2-16 years
- Incorporates five categories of pain behaviours: facial expression; leg movement; activity; cry; and consolability.
- Each of these five operationally defined categories is given a score from 0 to 2; yielding a total possible range of 0 to 10.
- The FLACC provides a simple framework for quantifying pain behaviours in children who may not be able to verbalize the presence or severity of pain.

||0|1|2|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Face**|No particular expression/smile|Occasional grimace/frown; appears sad/worried|Constant grimace/frown, distressed|
|**Legs**|Normal position or relaxed|Uneasy, restless, occasional tremors|Kicking or legs drawn up|
|**Activity**|Lying quietly, moves easily|Squirming, tense, mildly agitated|Arched, rigid, severe agitation|
|**Cry**|No cry (awake or asleep)|Moans or whimpers|Crying steadily|
|**Consolability**|Content, relaxed|Reassured by touch, talking|Difficult to console|

**Pain Score Rating:**
- **1-3**: Mild
- **4-6**: Moderate
- **7-10**: Severe
### Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) for Children Under 2 Months

- **Scoring**: Each domain is scored from 1 to 5, yielding a total score that reflects sedation level.

# Pharmacological Therapies

## Paracetamol
- **Mechanism of Action (MOA)**: Involves inhibition of prostaglandin H2 and COX-3 (found in the CNS).
- **Effect**: Antipyretic and analgesic. Comparable efficacy to NSAIDs and has opioid-sparing effects.
- **Dosage**: 15–20 mg/kg every 4–6 hours for pain relief and fever reduction. Maximum daily dose is 90 mg/kg for children older than 3 months.
- **IV Onset**: 5 minutes.
## Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatories (NSAIDs)
- **MOA**: Inhibits COX-2 isoenzyme, blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and thromboxane, reducing inflammation and nociception.
- **Recommendation**: NSAIDs combined with paracetamol offer synergistic effects.
### Ibuprofen
- **Route**: Oral or IV.
- **Use**: Perioperative pain in children >7 kg and closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in neonates.
- **Dosage**: 30 mg/kg divided into 3-4 doses.
### Diclofenac
- **Route**: Oral, rectal, or IV.
- **Dosage**: 0.3–1 mg/kg (max 50 mg) three times daily.
### Ketorolac
- **Route**: Oral, IM, or IV.
- **Use**: For short-term management of acute postoperative pain. Not licensed for children under 16 years.
- **Dosage**:
  - **Oral** (16-18 years): 10 mg every 4–6 hours (max 40 mg/day for 7 days).
  - **IV** (6 months–16 years): Initial dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg (max 15 mg), followed by 500 mcg/kg (max 15 mg) every 6 hours (max 60 mg/day, max 2 days).
## Opioids
- **MOA**: Bind to specific receptors (Mu, Kappa, Delta, ORL-1) throughout the CNS and at sites of peripheral inflammation. Mu receptors are most significant in pain management.
- **Use**: First-line for acute pain.
### Codeine
- **Metabolism**: Converted to morphine via O-demethylation by cytochrome CYP2D6 (variable enzyme activity).
- **Dosage**: Best used with paracetamol. Oral dose is 0.5–1 mg/kg every 4–6 hours.
### Morphine
- **Routes**: Oral, IV, IM, SC, rectal, intrathecal, epidural, and intranasal.

- **Dosage**:
  - **IV Neonates**: Titrate up to 0.5 mg/kg.
  - **Oral**:
	- 1–6 months: 50–150 mcg/kg every 4 hours.
	- 6 months–12 years: 100–300 mcg/kg every 4 hours.
	- 12–18 years: 5–20 mg every 4 hours.
  - **PCA**: Bolus 20 mcg/kg, background infusion 4 mcg/kg/h.
### Fentanyl
- **Routes**: IV, transmucosal, transdermal, inhalational, or intranasal.
- **MOA**: Synthetic phenylpiperidine with rapid onset and offset, 100 times more potent than morphine.
- **Metabolism**: Inactive metabolites.

- **MOA**: Synthetic phenylpiperidine with rapid breakdown by plasma and tissue esterases (half-life 3–10 minutes).
- **Use**: Intraoperative; may cause postoperative hyperalgesia.
- **Dosage**:
  - **Loading dose**: 0.1–1 mcg/kg over 30 seconds.
  - **Infusion**: 3–80 mcg/kg/h (up to 120 mcg/kg/h for older children).
### Tramadol
- **MOA**: Centrally acting analgesic, structurally related to morphine. Racemic mixture with synergistic antinociceptive effects.
- **Metabolism**: Biotransformed by CYP2D6 to O-desmethyl-tramadol (greater affinity for mu-opioid receptors).
- **Dosage**:
  - **Oral**: 12–18 years, 50–100 mg every 4 hours (max 400 mg/day).
  - **IV/IM**: Same dose for children 12–18 years.
## Ketamine
- **MOA**: NMDA receptor antagonist that blocks peripheral nociception and prevents central sensitization.

# Caudal Anaesthesia

## Indications

Caudal anaesthesia is commonly indicated for both surgical and non-surgical procedures involving painful interventions in areas below the umbilicus. The sub-umbilical region represents the primary area of interest for caudal anaesthesia. Procedures that may involve mid-abdominal structures may require alternative or adjunct anaesthetic techniques due to the limited distribution of caudal anaesthesia.

- **Sub-umbilical indications**: Surgeries such as hernia repairs, urological procedures, and lower extremity operations.
- **Mid-abdominal indications**: Typically not recommended as the anaesthetic coverage of caudal blocks may not extend adequately beyond the sub-umbilical region.
## Contraindications

Certain conditions prohibit the use of caudal anaesthesia in children:

- **Absolute contraindications**:
	- Local infection at the injection site.
	- Pilonidal cysts.
	- Spinal dysraphism (e.g., tethered cord syndrome).
- **Relative contraindications**:
	- Other spinal or meningeal anomalies, such as spina bifida occulta, require further preoperative anatomical investigation, usually by **ultrasound** or **MRI** to assess for safe caudal block administration.
## Anatomical Considerations

- **Access for caudal anaesthesia**: Caudal anaesthesia is feasible and generally safe for children weighing up to 50 kg.
	
- **Age-related spinal cord considerations**:
	
	- The spinal cord and dural sac terminate at variable levels depending on the patient's age. For example, during the pubertal growth spurt, the spinal cord termination may shift cranially from the **L3** to **L1-L2** level within a year.
	- In contrast, in younger children, the dural sac may extend lower, with some studies showing termination at **S2-S3** in 8% of cases, thus increasing the risk of inadvertent dural puncture, particularly in neonates and toddlers.
- **Body positioning and its impact**: The patient’s body positioning significantly impacts the procedure. **Lateral decubitus positioning** with maximal flexion of the neck, hips, and knees results in a cephalad shift of the dural sac, reducing the likelihood of complications such as dural puncture.

####Palpation for Needle Insertion

1. **Positioning**: The patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, with hips and knees flexed.
	
2. **Landmark identification**:
	
	- Palpate the **posterior superior iliac spines**, forming **Tuffier's line** between them, which helps identify the location of the sacral hiatus.
	- The sacrococcygeal ligament, located between the two sacral cornua, serves as the site for needle insertion.
	- Needle insertion should begin at a **45-degree angle**, with adjustment to a flatter angle as it is advanced to the correct position.
3. **Neonates**: Tuffier’s line is unreliable in neonates, as it shifts caudally when the patient is in the lateral flexed position.
	
4. **Aspirating prior to injection**: Before injecting the local anaesthetic, careful aspiration or passive drainage should be performed to rule out intravascular or spinal needle placement.
	
## Technical Considerations

- **Ultrasound vs Landmarks**:
	
	- **Landmark-based technique**: Commonly used but prone to block failure, particularly when anatomical variations are present.
	- **Ultrasound-guided technique**: Superior to the landmark-based approach, particularly in preterm infants or when the sacral anatomy is unclear. It increases success rates and minimizes complications.
- **Needle types**:
	
	- Needle selection is critical, as incorrect equipment can lead to preventable complications. For single-injection caudal blocks, **narrow-gauge (22-25 gauge) Tuohy or Crawford needles** are often preferred. Short-bevel needles reduce tissue trauma.
	- Unlike adult caudal blocks, paediatric caudal blocks usually do not require a stylet needle.
## Complications and Safety in Paediatric Caudal Anaesthesia

### Complications of Caudal Epidural Blockade
- **Common complications**: Caudal blocks in children are associated with a range of adverse events, though the overall risk is low. These complications include:
  - **Haemodynamic instability**: Hypotension and arrhythmias, especially when combined with general anaesthesia.
  - **Respiratory depression**: This can occur due to inadvertent cephalad spread of the anaesthetic.
  - **Toxicity**: Seizures and cardiac toxicity can arise from local anaesthetic toxicity, although this is rare.
  - **Infection/inflammation**: Infection at the puncture site, sacral osteomyelitis, or local nerve injury.

  A large study by **Ecoffey et al.** involving 31,132 regional anaesthetic procedures identified only eight caudal block-related complications, including six dural punctures (without postdural puncture headache), one nerve injury, and one case of cardiac toxicity. Similarly, **Polaner et al.** found no significant complications in their study, with the main issues being difficulty placing the block and block failure.

- **Anaesthesia during sedation**: Unlike in adults, where central regional blocks are often conducted while the patient is awake, children are typically sedated to prevent movement during the procedure. Available literature supports the safety of regional anaesthesia under deep sedation or general anaesthesia.

## Choice of Local Anaesthetics

- **Bupivacaine vs Ropivacaine**:
  - **Bupivacaine** (0.125-0.25%) and **Ropivacaine** (0.1-0.375%) are commonly used for caudal blocks in paediatric patients. Volumes vary based on the desired dermatomal coverage:
	- 0.5 ml/kg for sacral dermatomes.
	- 1.0 ml/kg for lumbar dermatomes.
	- 1.25 ml/kg for lower thoracic dermatomes.
  - Doses should not exceed 2 mg/ml for ropivacaine and 2.5 mg/ml for bupivacaine. Ropivacaine, which causes less postoperative motor blockade than bupivacaine, is considered safer at higher concentrations (up to 3.1 mg/ml for volumes of 1 ml/kg).
  
- **Toxicity risk**:
  - Children have an increased risk of systemic toxicity due to age-dependent variations in plasma levels of alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) and immaturity of the cytochrome P450 system. The AGP, which binds local anaesthetics, is low at birth and increases during the first year of life. The P450 system, responsible for drug metabolism, matures throughout childhood, with bupivacaine metabolized by CYP3A4 and ropivacaine by CYP1A2.
  - While a greater volume of distribution in children reduces peak plasma concentrations after single bolus injections, continuous application can result in drug accumulation due to the immature metabolism.
- **Toxicity management**:
  - **Systemic toxicity**: Cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity are the main risks. Guidelines recommend **Intralipid® 20%** as first-line therapy for haemodynamic deterioration, administered as a bolus (1-1.5 ml/kg) followed by continuous infusion (0.25 ml/kg/min) with repeated boluses every 3-5 minutes if necessary.
  - **Seizures**: Neurotoxic seizures should be managed with **propofol**, **benzodiazepines**, or **barbiturates**.

### Use of Adjuvant Drugs

- **Clonidine**: The most widely used adjuvant, clonidine enhances the duration of caudal blocks by binding to alpha-2 receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The recommended dose is 1-2 μg/kg. Its use in preterm infants and those under three months remains debated due to a potential risk of apnoea.
  
- **Dexmedetomidine**: Similar in effect to clonidine but with a shorter half-life, dexmedetomidine prolongs caudal block duration. Effective doses range from 1-2 μg/kg, with the higher dose associated with bradycardia in some cases.
  
- **Opioids**:
  - **Morphine**: Recommended at 10-30 μg/kg for caudal blocks. As a hydrophilic opioid, morphine provides long-lasting analgesia (up to 24 hours) but is associated with side effects such as pruritus, nausea, and potentially life-threatening respiratory depression.
  - **Fentanyl and Sufentanil**: These lipophilic opioids offer shorter-duration analgesia (up to 4 hours) and are not recommended due to limited efficacy and a higher side effect profile.
  
- **Ketamine**: Preservative-free ketamine can be used at 0.5-1 mg/kg without causing respiratory side effects. However, concerns about neurotoxicity at higher doses, based on animal studies, suggest using the lower range of dosing.

- Current guidelines follow **Armitage’s formula** for estimating dermatomal spread:
  - 0.5 ml/kg for sacral coverage.
  - 1.0 ml/kg for lumbar coverage.
  - 1.25 ml/kg for mid-thoracic coverage.

Studies have shown that the cranial spread of local anaesthetics is inversely related to the patient’s age, with ultrasound revealing a limit to the initial cranial spread at the T10 level. A **cranial rebound** mechanism has been described, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shifts cranially during the injection, followed by caudal return of CSF, leading to secondary cranial spread of the local anaesthetic within 15 minutes.

Despite these findings, inadequate block coverage still occurs even with high-dose administration, highlighting the need for further investigation into the mechanisms of cranial spread and their clinical implications.

# Epidural Anaesthesia in Paediatrics

Epidurals in paediatric patients offer optimal analgesia while avoiding opioid-related side effects, with studies showing fewer episodes of hypoxaemia, respiratory depression, and reduced need for post-operative ventilation or intensive care. Additional benefits include greater haemodynamic stability, improved gastrointestinal function, less nausea and vomiting, and a reduced neurohumoral stress response.

## **Indications**

Epidural blocks are often used in combination with general anaesthesia or sedation, with few scenarios where they are the sole anaesthetic technique. Indications for using epidurals in children include:

- **Patients where general anaesthesia may be risky**, such as those with:
	
	- Hypotonia
	- History of apnoea or bronchopulmonary dysplasia
	- Cystic fibrosis
	- History of malignant hyperthermia
	- Older children who prefer to remain awake
- **Patients with comorbidities**, particularly those with cerebral palsy undergoing lower limb surgery, where pain assessment may be challenging due to intellectual disabilities or communication difficulties.
	
- **Children with asthma or respiratory disease**, where epidurals can block afferent pain pathways, thereby improving respiratory muscle function and ventilation.
	
- **Surgical procedures** benefiting from epidural analgesia:
	
	- Thoracic, abdominal, and orthopaedic procedures
	- General surgery, major urological procedures, spinal, and plastic surgery

Compared to intravenous techniques, epidural analgesia—whether continuous or patient-controlled—is associated with **lower pain scores** and **reduced post-operative nausea and vomiting**.

## **Contraindications**

Contraindications in paediatric epidurals are similar to those in adults, and include both absolute and relative factors:

- **Absolute contraindications**:
	
	- Lack of parental consent or patient assent (in children >12 years)
	- Local infection at the insertion site
	- Coagulopathy
	- True local anaesthetic allergy
- **Relative contraindications**:
	
	- Anatomical abnormalities
	- Neurological disease
	- Sepsis
	- Immunodeficiency
	- Raised intracranial pressure
	- Previous spinal surgery
	- Requirement for post-operative testing of motor or sensory function

## **Anatomy, Physiology, and Pharmacology**

Paediatric epidural anaesthesia must account for significant anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological differences between children and adults.

##### **Anatomy**

- The **spinal cord terminates at L3** in neonates compared to L1 in adults, a difference that persists until around 12 months of age.
- The **dural sac ends at S3 in neonates** but at S1-S2 in adults.
- An imaginary **intercristal line** drawn between the iliac crests is typically below the spinal cord at any age, passing closer to **L5-S1 in neonates** and the **L3-4 interspace in adults**.
- Additional anatomical differences in children include incomplete vertebral ossification, a thin ligamentum flavum, and a larger, more compliant epidural space with less fat and fibrous tissue. This makes catheter insertion easier and allows for higher levels of block from lower approaches.
##### **Physiology**

- Epidural blockade in children causes **less haemodynamic disturbance** than in adults. Hypotension is uncommon in children under 8 years due to lower circulating volume in the lower limbs and splanchnic system, along with a lack of peripheral vascular tone. In older children, sympathetic block results in a moderate blood pressure reduction (up to 20-25%).
##### **Pharmacology**

- The pharmacology of local anaesthetics varies significantly with age. Neonates and children have a relatively high cardiac output, increased tissue blood flow, and lower plasma protein concentrations, particularly in neonates. These factors contribute to **higher initial plasma concentrations** and an **increased risk of toxicity**.
- Neonates have immature hepatic and renal function until around 3 months, further increasing the risk of local anaesthetic accumulation. Additionally, neonates and young children may have **increased blood-brain barrier permeability**, though this is still debated.
- **Incomplete myelination** and increased **endoneurium permeability** in young children lead to shorter durations and faster onsets of nerve blockade.
## Paediatric Epidural Insertion Technique

Safe paediatric epidural insertion adheres to the same principles as neuraxial anaesthesia in all patients. Key considerations include patient monitoring, skin preparation, sterile technique, and use of a test dose to reduce complications. The standard procedure for epidural insertion is not covered in detail, but important aspects specific to paediatric cases are outlined below.

### **Positioning**
- **Lateral decubitus position** with hips and knees flexed and spine arched to open the interlaminar space is typically used.
- A **midline approach** is employed, and the **loss of resistance** technique, commonly used in adult patients, is similarly applied in children.
- For **thoracic epidurals**, the horizontal orientation of the thoracic vertebrae in children allows for a midline approach until adolescence.
### **Depth Estimation**
- The epidural space is **more superficial** in children than adults.
- A widely accepted formula for estimating epidural depth is:
  - **Epidural depth = 1 mm per kg body weight.**
- The mean depth for neonates is around **1 cm** (range: 0.4-1.5 cm).
### **Needles**
- Paediatric epidural needles are typically **18G or 19G**, with shorter lengths and **0.5 cm markings** for easier handling.
### **Test Dose**
- To avoid intravascular or subarachnoid injection, use a **test dose** of 0.1 mL/kg (up to 3 mL) of local anaesthetic (e.g., 0.25% bupivacaine with 5 mcg/mL adrenaline).
- A **positive test dose** is indicated by:
  - Heart rate increase >10 bpm
  - Systolic blood pressure increase >15 mmHg
  - 25% change in T-wave amplitude
### Drugs and Dosing

The volume and concentration of local anaesthetic for epidural infusion are determined by the location of surgery and the level of the epidural catheter.

#### **Dosing Guidelines**
- **Initial bolus** in younger children: 0.04 mL/kg/segment.
- **Older children (>10 years)**: Volume per spinal segment = 1/10 x age (years).
- **Surgical considerations**:
  - Lumbar epidurals: 0.25-0.5 mL/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine.
  - Thoracic epidurals: Approximately half the lumbar dose.
- **Continuous infusion**: 0.2-0.4 mL/kg/hour of 0.1% bupivacaine.
- Infusion rates should be reduced in infants (<12 months) due to the risk of drug accumulation.
#### **Choice Of Drugs**
- **Bupivacaine, Ropivacaine, Levobupivacaine**: Effective in various concentrations, with lower concentrations typically preferred.
- **Additives**: Opioids or clonidine may prolong analgesia and improve block quality but can increase side effects (e.g., nausea, urinary retention, respiratory depression). Clonidine is not recommended for children <6 months.
- **Other agents**: Ketamine and tramadol have limited evidence for safety in paediatric use.

### Awake vs. Asleep Epidural Insertion

Paediatric epidurals are often performed under general anaesthesia due to limited cooperation, patient movement, and discomfort. Evidence supports that regional anaesthesia under general anaesthesia is safe and does not increase risks compared to awake procedures.

- **PRAN study**: No differences in major or transient complications between awake and anaesthetised patients.
- **ADARPEF study**: Confirmed low complication rates with no serious long-term sequelae.

Ultrasound guidance can be employed to improve safety, especially in neonates and infants, allowing real-time visualisation of neuraxial structures, reduced insertion time, and the visualisation of local anaesthetic spread.

## Complications

Paediatric epidurals carry a low risk of serious complications. The **ADARPEF study** reported a 0.12% complication rate for regional anaesthesia, with central neuraxial blocks having a sixfold higher risk than peripheral blocks.

#### **Common Complications**
- Block failure or incomplete block
- Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH)
- Opioid-related side effects: nausea, pruritus, urinary retention, respiratory depression
#### **UK National Paediatric Epidural Audit**
- **Incidents**: 96 incidents in over 10,000 epidurals (~1:100).
- **Complication rates**:
  - Post-epidural infection: 1:300
  - PDPH: 1:2000
  - Nerve injury: 1:2000
  - Inadvertent spinal anaesthesia: 1:5000
  - Drug error: 1:1000
  - Local anaesthetic toxicity: 1:10,000

Severe complications are rare but more likely in neonates and infants. The complication rate in children <6 months is four times higher than in older children.

## Post-Operative Management

Post-operative epidural management requires careful monitoring, regular assessment, and clear protocols to ensure effective pain relief and minimise complications.

- **Regular assessment**: Includes patient self-reporting, observational assessments, and physiological monitoring (e.g., temperature, motor function, and epidural site examination).
- **Challenges**: Pain assessment is particularly difficult in non-verbal children or those with intellectual disabilities, such as cerebral palsy.
- **Block failure**: 2-9% of epidurals may fail or be inadequate. Regular monitoring and assessment of block quality are essential.
