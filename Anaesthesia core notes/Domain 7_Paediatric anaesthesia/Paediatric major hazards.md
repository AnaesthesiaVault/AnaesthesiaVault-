# Incidence of Severe Critical Events in Paediatric Anaesthesia (APRICOT): a Prospective Multicentre Observational Study in 261 Hospitals in Europe

### Introduction

- **Paediatric anaesthesia guidelines and training programmes** have been developed in Europe over the past decade to standardise practice and improve patient safety.
- The **incidence, nature, and outcomes** of severe critical events during and immediately after anaesthesia in children in Europe, and how variability in practice affects these, are not well understood.
- Existing literature on paediatric anaesthesia morbidity and mortality:
	- Mostly consists of **clinical audits** from single institutions or countries.
	- These studies were **underpowered** to evaluate rare, severe complications or mortality.
	- **Differences in study design and definitions** of severe complications make comparisons difficult.
- In 2014, a **North American register** for safety and quality improvement in paediatric anaesthesia reported a **0.14% incidence** of severe critical events.
	- This aligns with earlier studies from single centres or countries, showing a low rate of **major perioperative complications** (severe morbidity or mortality) after general or regional anaesthesia.
- **Respiratory complications** have been identified as the main cause of severe adverse outcomes after sedation or general anaesthesia in children.
- Some studies have noted a rise in **haemodynamic-related severe critical events**, often due to bleeding or **inadequate fluid management**.
- **Major risk factors** identified in studies include:
	- Age <1 year
	- Presence of **comorbidities**
	- Specific **surgical procedures**.
- **Identifying predictable and preventable risks** is crucial for establishing practice standards to improve the safety of paediatric anaesthesia across Europe.
- This study aimed to:
	- Determine the **incidence and nature** of severe critical events in children undergoing anaesthesia in Europe.
	- Identify the **outcomes** of these events, defined as respiratory, cardiac, allergic, or neurological complications that required immediate intervention and could lead to major disability or death.
	- Identify **risk factors** contributing to these events.
	- Describe **variations** in paediatric anaesthesia practice across Europe.

### Discussion

- **Study Overview**: A large, prospective, multicentre cohort study was conducted to determine the **incidence and nature of severe critical events** in children undergoing anaesthesia in Europe.
	
	- Results showed significant **variability across centres in 33 European countries**.
	- **Respiratory-related events** were the most frequent complications across all age groups.
	- **Cardiovascular events** were predominantly seen in neonates and infants.
- **Outcomes of Critical Events**:
	
	- While most critical events had **uneventful outcomes**, one in six patients required **additional treatment or prolonged hospitalisation**.
	- The **variation in paediatric anaesthesia practice** highlights the need for widespread adoption of **clinical guidelines** and management standards across Europe.
- **Study Design**:
	
	- The study was an **anonymised observational audit** of current paediatric anaesthesia practices.
	- Anaesthesia management was left to the discretion of the **healthcare provider**.
	- Local ethics committees had differing views on the need for **parental consent**, so some children were excluded.
	- **89% of anaesthetised children** were included, with data from **261 institutions**.
	- The study's findings are **generalizable**, though non-participating centres' outcomes remain unknown.
- **Data Quality**:
	
	- A **uniform definition** of adverse events was used to reduce interpretation variability.
	- **29000 queries** were sent to participating centres to ensure objectivity.
	- Complications were reviewed by two independent investigators, with confirmation from local investigators when needed.
- **Higher Incidence of Severe Events**:
	
	- The study revealed a **higher incidence of severe critical events** than previously reported in literature, likely due to:
		- The use of **retrospective analysis** or voluntary self-reporting in past studies, which may have underestimated morbidity.
	- Despite the higher incidence of critical events, **30-day in-hospital mortality** was lower than other studies.
- **Variation Among Countries**:
	
	- Significant differences in the **nature and occurrence of severe critical events** were noted among participating countries.
	- The data will support future **quality improvement initiatives** across Europe.
	- **Non-evidence-based strategies** were often used to manage complications.
- **Sample Size and Power**:
	
	- The study was **not adequately powered** to identify risk factors by individual institution or event type.
	- There was some evidence linking **low volume of paediatric cases** with a higher incidence of cardiac arrest.
- **Anaesthesia Team Composition**:
	
	- In 55% of cases, **one anaesthesiologist** performed the procedure, reflecting the variability in the availability of **paediatric anaesthesia nurses**.
	- No significant difference in severe critical events was found based on **team size or composition**.
- **Age as a Risk Factor**:
	
	- **Age** was a major risk factor for severe critical events:
		- **Cardiovascular events** were more frequent in neonates.
		- **Respiratory events** were more common in infants and pre-school children.
	- Children younger than **3-3.5 years** may require management by **tertiary care providers** or **paediatric anaesthesiologists**.
- **ASA Physical Status**:
	
	- The **ASA physical status** was useful for risk stratification.
	- A higher **ASA-PS (>III)** was associated with severe cardiovascular events, particularly in cases involving **handicap, congenital heart disease, fever, or snoring**.
- **Snoring as a Risk Factor**:
	
	- **Snoring** was identified as a risk factor for severe critical events, independent of **ENT surgery**.
- **Variability in Anaesthesia Management**:
	
	- There was significant **variability in anaesthesia practice** across Europe, including drug combinations and techniques.
	- **Intubation without muscle relaxants** increased the risk of **bronchospasm**. There were no reports of anaphylaxis related to muscle relaxants.
- **Key Study Findings**:
	
	- Provides insights into **paediatric anaesthesia practices** across 33 European countries.
	- Higher incidence of **respiratory and cardiac critical events** than previously published.
	- Young age, medical history, and **ASA physical status** were the most significant **risk factors** for severe critical events.
	- Children under **3 years** or those with complex medical histories should be anaesthetised by **experienced paediatric anaesthesiologists**.
- **Conclusion**:
	
	- Findings from APRICOT will assist in developing **quality improvement projects** and **standards of care** to reduce the risk of severe critical events in paediatric anaesthesia across Europe.
# Paediatric Emergencies

## Introduction

- In 2006, the **UK Department of Health (DoH)** published _The Acutely or Critically Sick or Injured Child in the District General Hospital: A Team Response_:
	
	- Outlined responsibilities of health services and professionals in caring for critically ill children.
	- Emphasised a **team approach** and the role of **anaesthetists** in managing sick children.
- **Six Key Skills** expected of all health professionals in District General Hospitals (DGHs):
	
	1. **Recognise** critically sick or injured children.
	2. **Initiate appropriate immediate treatment**.
	3. **Work as part of a team**.
	4. **Maintain and enhance skills**.
	5. Be aware of **safeguarding children** issues.
	6. **Communicate effectively** with children and their carers.
- The DoH report highlights the importance of anaesthetists in the **assessment, initial management, and stabilisation** of sick children:
	
	- DGH staff must be prepared to **transfer critically ill patients** (e.g., head injury, intracranial haemorrhage) if a retrieval team is unavailable.
	- DGH staff have been shown to **successfully stabilise critically ill children** in most cases, including performing tracheal intubations.
- The article covers care aspects of **medical and surgical paediatric emergencies** that may be encountered by anaesthetists providing on-call or emergency services at a DGH.
### Paediatric Respiratory Emergencies

- **Acute respiratory illnesses** are common in children presenting to hospitals, though anaesthetist involvement is rare.
- When anaesthetic care is required, it often demands **rapid assessment and management** of severely ill children.
#### Key Factors in Paediatric Respiratory Emergencies

- **Infants are at higher risk** due to:
	- Higher oxygen consumption.
	- Smaller functional residual capacity.
	- Increased airway resistance.
	- Softer, cartilaginous airways prone to **dynamic obstruction**.
- According to **Hagen-Poiseuille’s equation**, airway resistance increases dramatically with small amounts of mucosal swelling.
- Children can develop **respiratory failure quickly** due to muscle fatigue.
#### Respiratory Distress Assessment

- Look for **tachypnoea**, **accessory muscle use**, intercostal, subcostal, or suprasternal **recession**, and abnormal sounds (stridor, wheeze, grunting).
- **Difficulty talking or feeding** is significant.
- Diminished breath sounds may indicate **impending respiratory arrest**.
- Further signs of **hypoxia** include reduced consciousness, agitation, and confusion.
- **Continuous pulse oximetry** is vital, but cyanosis can be difficult to detect and its absence doesn’t rule out respiratory failure.
#### Management Approach

- Use a **structured approach** similar to trauma management, focusing on **airway, breathing, and circulation**.
### Stridor

#### Common Causes
- **Viral croup** (most common).
- Other causes: non-infectious croup, **foreign body**, tonsillitis, anaphylaxis, tracheitis, diphtheria, and epiglottitis.
### Croup

- **Peak incidence**: 6 months to 3 years, affecting about 3% of children under 6 years annually.
- Presents with a **barking cough**, sometimes preceded by mild fever and runny nose.
- Less than 5% of croup cases require hospital admission, and only 1% require tracheal intubation.
#### Croup Management

- **Supportive care**: Keep the child with their carer and avoid unnecessary distress.
- Begin **continuous oximetry** and provide oxygen if tolerated.
- **Nebulised adrenaline** (0.5 mL/kg of 1:1000, max 5 mL) can improve symptoms within 30 minutes, but the effect may wear off by 2 hours.
- **Glucocorticoids** (oral dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg or prednisolone 1 mg/kg) help reduce symptoms within 6 hours and lower the need for intubation.
- **Tracheal intubation** should be considered for children with persistent respiratory distress or hypoxia despite treatment.
- Intubation is usually done with **inhalation induction** and a **smaller tracheal tube** due to subglottic narrowing.
### Airway Foreign Body (AFB)

- A **life-threatening event**, common in children under 3 years old, with 50% of cases occurring in children under 2.
- Hospital mortality for AFB is **3.4%**.
#### AFB Presentation

- Symptoms vary with **size, position, and mobility** of the foreign body.
- Common symptoms: **choking episode**, cough, wheeze, dyspnoea, stridor, or voice changes.
- Diagnosis may require a **chest X-ray**, though most foreign bodies are organic and not radiopaque.
#### Initial Management

- Assess **cough ability** to determine severity:
	- **Effective cough**: Mild obstruction; encourage coughing and monitor.
	- **Ineffective cough**: Severe obstruction; perform up to five back blows.
	- UK Resuscitation Council recommends **abdominal thrusts**; the Australian Resuscitation Council suggests **chest thrusts** due to risk of liver injury.
- If the child is **unconscious**, perform **cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)** and use advanced life support if necessary.
- **Definitive treatment** is **removal via rigid bronchoscopy**.
### Epiglottitis

- **Rare** due to **Haemophilus influenzae type-b (Hib) vaccination**, with a 10-fold reduction in cases.
- Differentiated from other causes of stridor by the presence of **drooling**, refusal to swallow, and dysphagia.
#### Management of Epiglottitis

- Prepare for **difficult intubation** with surgical backup.
- Use **inhalational induction** and maintain **spontaneous ventilation**.
- Administer **third-generation cephalosporins** after obtaining swabs and blood cultures.
### Status Asthmaticus

- Children with severe asthma who don’t respond to standard treatment may require **anaesthetist involvement**.
- **Intubation rates** are higher in peripheral hospitals compared to specialist centres.
#### Presentation

- Evidence of respiratory distress with **cough, wheeze**, and increased work of breathing.
- **Wheeze** does not correlate with severity, and **absence of breath sounds** (silent chest) may indicate impending arrest.
#### Management

- **Oxygen therapy**, **inhaled β-agonists**, and **corticosteroids** are the main treatments.
- Avoid **intubation** if possible, as it can lead to barotrauma and cardiovascular collapse.
- Consider **non-invasive positive pressure ventilation**.
#### Indications for Intubation

1. **Cardiorespiratory arrest**.
2. **Respiratory arrest**.
3. **Severe hypoxaemia**.
4. Severe **hypercapnia** (>10 kPa) with life-threatening symptoms (silent chest, altered consciousness, cyanosis, SpO2 < 92%).
5. **Progressive deterioration** despite medical management.
#### Ventilation Strategies

- Similar to adults: Aim to maintain **oxygenation** while minimizing lung trauma.
- Allow moderate **hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis**.
- **Volatile agents** may be helpful but are difficult to use during transfers.
### Sepsis

- **Sepsis** is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children.
	- In 1995, it was the **second most common cause of death** in children aged 1–14 in the USA, with a mortality rate of **10%** for children with severe sepsis.
- The **Advanced Paediatric Life Support (APLS)** defines septic shock as sepsis with **cardiovascular organ dysfunction**.
- **Meningococcal sepsis** is the most common bacterial cause of septic shock in UK children and affects primarily **previously healthy children**.
- Diagnosis of septic shock involves signs of **inadequate tissue perfusion**:
	- Hypoor hyperthermia.
	- Decreased mental status, prolonged capillary refill (>2s), diminished pulses, cool peripheries, or bounding peripheral pulses.
	- Hypotension may **not always be present**.
- **Management follows the ABC approach**:
	- **Isotonic fluid boluses** of 20 mL/kg.
	- Up to **200 mL/kg** may be needed in the first hour, but typically 40–60 mL/kg.
	- Consider **inotropic support**, intubation, and ventilation if shock persists.
	- **Central venous access** should be attempted; femoral line preferred if internal jugular approach is not feasible.
	- Inotropes may be administered through **peripheral or intraosseous lines** if central access is not available.
- **Early aggressive fluid resuscitation** improves outcomes.
	- UK study: 62% of children with septic shock **did not receive adequate fluids** according to guidelines.
- **Tracheal intubation and ventilation** can reverse shock by reducing cardiac output required for ventilation.
	- **Ketamine** is recommended for induction due to its ability to maintain circulation.
### Status Epilepticus

- **Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE)** is defined as a seizure lasting >30 minutes or two seizures without consciousness recovery.
	- CSE is more common in children than adults, with a **lower risk of death**.
	- Common causes: **febrile seizures, CNS infection, epilepsy, hypoxia**, and **metabolic abnormalities**.
- **Anaesthetists’ role**:
	- Manage **airway** and assist with **anticonvulsant** administration.
	- Use **ABCDE approach** for management.
- **Anticonvulsant treatment**:
	- Up to two doses of **intravenous benzodiazepine** (lorazepam 0.1 mL/kg).
	- If CSE persists: **phenytoin (20 mg/kg)** followed by **phenobarbital (20 mg/kg)**.
	- Final escalation: **Thiopental (4 mg/kg)** or **propofol** for rapid sequence induction.
	- **Levetiracetam** is emerging as an effective alternative in treating CSE.
- Avoid **long-term neuromuscular blockade** as it can mask further seizures.
- **Anaesthetic infusions** carry a risk of cardiopulmonary depression and must be closely monitored.
### Acute Abdomen in the Newborn

- Common causes:
	- **Gastroschisis** and **exomphalos**: Abdominal wall abnormalities where intestines and organs prolapse outside the abdomen.
	- **Necrotising enterocolitis**: Causes peritonitis, particularly in premature or low birthweight infants.
- **Signs and symptoms** of necrotising enterocolitis:
	- Feeding intolerance, abdominal distension, bile-stained aspirates, apnoea, respiratory distress, sepsis, anaemia, coagulopathy, and metabolic acidosis.
#### Management

- **Sterile plastic wrapping** should be applied to gastroschisis or exomphalos to prevent dehydration, hypothermia, and infection.
- **Intubation** may be necessary for significant respiratory distress, allowing for **pain management** without the risk of apnoea.
	- Avoid large tidal volumes (>8 mL/kg).
	- Use **volume-targeted ventilation** to reduce risks of **bronchopulmonary dysplasia** and **pneumothorax**.
- For **pre-term infants**, maintain oxygen saturations between **88% and 92%** to avoid **oxygen toxicity**.
- **Assessment of circulation** is challenging; indicators of hypovolaemia include:
	- **Cool peripheries**, **poor capillary refill**, **tachycardia**, and **hypotension**.
- **Normal blood pressure** in healthy term babies may be higher than expected, with mean arterial pressures exceeding 70 mmHg at 2 days of age and 90 mmHg at 6 weeks.
- For **pre-term infants**, the mean arterial pressure should approximate gestational age (e.g., 32 weeks = 32 mmHg).
### Intussusception

- **Common cause of bowel obstruction** in children.
	- If untreated, may lead to **bowel ischaemia, perforation**, and **death**.
- Annual incidence in UK infants: **66 per 100,000**, with peak occurrence in those aged 3–6 months.
- Occurs when a segment of bowel **invaginates** into a more distal segment (commonly at the **ileo-caecal junction** in 80% of cases).
	- Leads to **venous compression, oedema**, and **vascular compromise**.
	- Untreated cases may progress to **necrosis** or perforation.
#### Symptoms

- Non-specific: **vomiting, crying, lethargy, irritability**, and **pain**.
- Classic triad (emesis, pain, bloody stools) only present in **45% of cases**.
- **Abdominal mass** may be detected.
#### Treatment

- **Air enema** under fluoroscopic control is the treatment of choice, with a **success rate of 82%**.
- **IV fluids** (20-30 mL/kg of isotonic solution) are essential for managing **hypovolaemia**.
- If air enema fails, a **repeat enema** may be attempted.
- **Laparotomy** is required for failed air enema, involving possible **resection** of ischaemic bowel.
- **Anaesthetist involvement**: resuscitation, air enema monitoring, and transfer preparation.
### Management of a Child with a Bleeding Tonsil

- **Tonsillectomy** is a common paediatric surgery with **post-tonsillectomy bleeding** as a serious complication.
	- **Primary bleeding** (within 24 hours) occurs in up to **2%** of patients.
	- **Secondary bleeding** occurs in up to **5.5%**, peaking between postoperative days 4–7.
- **Hypovolaemic shock** and airway obstruction are major risks in bleeding tonsils.
#### Management

- Secure **IV access** and begin **fluid resuscitation**.
- Check **haemoglobin, coagulation profile**, and arrange **cross-matched blood**.
- Have a **difficult intubation trolley** and two suction units available for airway management.
- **Rapid sequence induction** is the most common anaesthetic approach, though **inhalational induction** may also be used.
	- A **smaller tracheal tube** may be needed due to airway oedema.
### Trauma in Children

- Trauma is the leading cause of death in children >1 year, accounting for **40% of deaths** in developed countries.
	- Major causes: **road traffic accidents** and **falls**.
	- **Head injuries** are the leading cause of trauma-related death, especially in infants.
#### Management

- **Anaesthetists’ role**: acute resuscitation, anaesthesia for emergency surgery, medical imaging, intensive care, pain management, and **transfer** to specialist centres.
- Follow **APLS, ATLS,** and **Primary Trauma Care** guidelines.
- Children’s metabolic rate is higher, leading to rapid desaturation if airway management is suboptimal.
#### Airway Management

- Challenges due to **larger head** and **higher, more anterior larynx**.
- Preoxygenation and **nasogastric tube** insertion are essential to reduce respiratory distress caused by **swallowed air**.
#### Spinal and Chest Injuries

- **Spinal cord injuries** are rare but **cervical spine immobilisation** should be ensured until injury is ruled out.
- Rib fractures are less common in children, but **haemothorax** and **pneumothorax** can occur without external injury signs.
#### Circulatory Management

- **Blood pressure** is unreliable; signs of shock include **tachycardia, poor peripheral circulation**, and confusion.
- **Capillary refill time (CRT)** is a useful indicator of circulatory status.
- For vascular access, **peripheral cannulation** is preferable, with **intraosseous access** being highly effective if needed.
#### Fluid Resuscitation

- For blunt trauma: **20 mL/kg isotonic fluid bolus**, reassess, and repeat as needed.
- For penetrating trauma: initial bolus of **10 mL/kg**, and seek surgical advice after a total of 20 mL/kg if signs of compromise persist.
- Consider **blood administration** after 40 mL/kg of crystalloid.
#### Pain Management

- **Pain management** is critical and requires anaesthetists to have a good working knowledge of appropriate drugs and techniques.
### The Child with Burns

- **Management of burns** is challenging, and anaesthetists play a critical role in **acute resuscitation**, stabilisation, and **transfer** to a specialist burns centre.
- **Anaesthetists’ responsibilities**:
	- Airway management
	- Ventilation
	- Vascular access
	- Fluid management
	- Analgesia
	- Assistance with transfer
#### General Approach

- Follow **ABC assessment** as with any injured child.
- **Airway obstruction** is rare in scalds, but **facial and tongue oedema** can occur, leading to obstruction.
- **Early tracheal intubation** is recommended for:
	- Inhalational injury
	- Patients needing large amounts of analgesia
	- Before **escharotomy**
#### Airway and Respiratory Considerations

- In large burns (>30% of body surface area), the **systemic inflammatory response** can lead to **pulmonary oedema** and **pulmonary hypertension**.
	- **Intubation and ventilation** should be used to ensure optimal respiratory function in the first 48 hours.
- The airway may **continue to swell** during the first 48 hours, so select a **correct tracheal tube size** accordingly.
	- **Cuffed tracheal tubes** are recommended to reduce respiratory complications.
- **Suxamethonium** is safe to use within the first 24 hours after a burn without significant risk of **hyperkalaemia**.
- Securing the tracheal tube in patients with **facial burns** can be challenging; consider using a **dental brace** for fixation.
#### Circulation and Fluid Management

- **Assessment of circulation** in distressed children is difficult:
	- Elevated heart and respiratory rates may result from **pain, anxiety**, or **hypovolaemia**.
	- **Mental state, urine output**, and **peripheral vasoconstriction** (e.g., delayed capillary refill time) can help identify shock.
	- Profound hypovolaemia within the first 2 hours is uncommon unless caused by **additional injuries**.
- **Early intravenous access** is crucial, preferably through **unburnt skin**; **intra-osseous access** may be needed if cannulation is difficult.
- Fluid resuscitation should follow the **modified Parkland formula**.
	- Avoid **over-resuscitation** to prevent **pulmonary oedema** and **abdominal compartment syndrome**.
	- Aim for a urine output of **> 0.75 mL/kg/h**.
#### Pain Management

- **Burn pain** is severe; strong analgesia should be administered after the primary survey and titrated for adequate relief.
	- Use **multi-modal analgesia** during acute pain management (e.g., **ketamine, tramadol, paracetamol, NSAIDs**, and opioids).
#### Escharotomy

- Traditionally thought to require minimal analgesia, but **partial-thickness burns** are often involved, making **escharotomy painful**.
	- For children, escharotomy is usually performed under **general anaesthesia**.
#### Transfer to Specialist Centre

- The decision to transfer to a specialist burns centre is based on the **size** and **site** of the burn.
	- Any burns patient resuscitated by an anaesthetist is typically considered for **transfer after stabilisation**.
