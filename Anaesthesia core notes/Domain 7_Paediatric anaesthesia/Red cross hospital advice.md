# Practical Advice for Red-Cross

## Academics/Meetings

### Huddle
- A daily huddle with surgeons and anaesthetists occurs at approximately **07:23** (officially 07:25). During this meeting, all cases for the day are discussed, and any issues should be raised.

### Academics
- **Tuesday mornings (07:15–07:45)**: Registrar presentations, consisting of short 20-minute presentations/paper cases and occasional journal club sessions.
- **Thursday mornings (07:30–08:00)**: Consultant-led Mortality and Morbidity meeting in the Anaesthetic Tearoom.
- **Friday afternoons**: Two emergency theatres run until 15:00, followed by the departmental Grand Meeting GSH.

## Theatre Allocations
- **Theatre 1**: Emergencies, general, and miscellaneous cases.
- **Theatre 2**: Burn surgery.
- **Theatre 3**: Neurosurgery, spinal surgery.
- **Theatre 4**: General surgery.
- **Theatre 5**: Urology, plastics, general surgery.
- **Theatre 6**: Cardiothoracic surgery.
- **Theatre 7**: Eye surgery.
- **Theatre 8**: ENT, scope list.
- **A7 (Outpatient lists)**: Located on the ground floor, past the pharmacy.
- **Trauma Theatre**: Currently not in use.

### A7 (Day Cases)
- Do not anaesthetise children under 1 year, <10kg, >55kg, or any ASA 2+ children with obstructive sleep apnoea, airway difficulties, or syndromes. Seek advice from the consultant on call or rebook the case for main theatre.
- If concerned post-op, inform the surgeon and admit the patient for observation.
- Heed advice from A7 sisters, especially regarding URTIs and suitability for cases, as they are experienced.

### Cardiac Theatre
- A drug list is available above the anaesthetic trolley in **Theatre 6**.
- Notify your consultant the day before your first cardiac case and discuss drug preferences and dilutions.
- Prepare theatre early before morning meetings. Check the machine, equipment, and draw up basic drugs (e.g., induction agent, muscle relaxant, adrenaline, phenylephrine, heparin, cefzol).
- Draw drugs for the perfusionist as indicated: Heparin 2000 IU (2mL), MgSO₄ (2mL syringe), Ca Gluc (4mL in a 5mL syringe). Label clearly and hand over to the perfusionist.
- Maintain communication with your consultant, theatre sister, scrub sister, and perfusionist about ICU bed availability. If an ICU bed is available, set up invasive monitoring, connect, and zero.
- Confirm inotrope preferences with your consultant, marking all drugs clearly with the "1mL/hr =?μg/kg/min" format.
- Double-check dilutions and doses of cardiac drugs to prevent errors.
- Limit the use of **Milrinone** to one ampule per patient due to cost. Follow the dilution chart behind the drug trolley.
- Arrange for blood products before the case begins (after 08:00). Complete the **Sending for Blood Form** and provide it to the porter.
- After inserting an arterial line, draw baseline bloods (blood gas and ACT) and notify the perfusionist of the haematocrit for bypass circuit priming.
- **ACT (Activated Clotting Time)** must be taken before and after Heparin administration. The ACT machine is located next to the computer in the theatre.
- Handle **TOE probes** with care and seek guidance from your consultant for cleaning instructions.

### Burns Theatre
- Wear apron, mask, and gloves.
- **Ketamine infusion**: Use 200mg Ketamine in 50mL Normal Saline (4mg/mL). Employ the **3-2-1 regime** (3x weight in mL/hr for 20 min, 2x weight for 20 min, 1x weight for the remainder of the case), delivering doses of 12, 8, and 4mg/kg/hr, respectively.
- **Ketofol** (Propofol + Ketamine mix): Recipe available on the whiteboard behind the anaesthetic machine.
- Learn the technique of securing the ETT for facial burns using a nasopharyngeal NGT looped from nostril to mouth, secured with a cable tie or ‘slick’.
- For **clysis**, mix 1 ampule of adrenaline with 1 ampule of bupivacaine and add 4.4mL of this solution to 200mL saline. Limit to 20mL/kg to avoid bupivacaine toxicity.
- Burn cases may have limited monitoring due to anatomical restrictions. Ensure clinical vigilance, especially during washing and dressing, and avoid being pressured by the surgical team if the patient is unstable.
- Monitor the tightness of dressings on the chest and abdomen to prevent impaired spontaneous ventilation post-extubation.

### Neurosurgery Theatre
- Post-op ICU patients must have a **CVP line** for fluid management and potential hypertonic saline administration.
- For cases involving **neuromonitoring (MEPs/SEPs)**, avoid neuromuscular blockers and inhalational agents. Use Sevoflurane induction until IV access is established, then switch to a TIVA technique.

## Premeds
- Everyone is responsible for premeds. Check the rota app for next day's lists.
- Theatre lists should be up in the main theatre nursing station by **13:00**. If not, they may be found in the wards:  
  **C2**: Burns  
  **D2**: General surgery, urology, scopes  
  **D1**: ENT, neurosurgery, eyes, plastics  
  **E1**: Cardiac, ENT high care  
  **B1/B2/E2**: Medical wards (scopes, etc.)  
  **G1**: Oncology
- Children <1 year often do not need premedication.
- Avoid premedication in children with potential airway compromise.
- **Midazolam**: 0.2–0.3mg/kg (max 15mg) PO 30 min pre-op or "on trolley". Only administer 3.75mg or 7.5mg aliquots due to tablet division.
- Preterm infants or those with a history of apnoea should receive **Caffeine** (20mg/kg PO 2 hours pre-op) or **Aminophylline** (5mg/kg IV slow bolus intraoperatively).
- **NPO guidelines**: Clear fluids or ½ DD apple juice (3mL/kg) up to 1 hour pre-op. Breast milk allowed up to 4 hours, formula milk up to 6 hours before surgery.

### Important Lists to See
- Check if there is a list for the post-call person and try to premed for them.
- Help premed consultant-only lists and colleagues stuck in theatre.
- Thursday lists are typically heavy (scopes, urology). Assist others to ensure everyone leaves on time.
- Call the consultant for the next day and review the premedications once all patients have been seen.

## Administrative
- Each patient must have a **red anaesthetic folder** in their yellow folder. These folders can be found in recovery.

### Adverse Event or Death Procedure
- Inform your consultant or HOD immediately.
- Decide who will communicate with the parents and what will be said.
- When communicating with parents, stick to the facts about the event and the child's condition.
- Do not speculate, blame others, or admit culpability. Express sympathy and provide support.
- Document the event thoroughly, including detailed reports, anaesthetic records, and the legal form GW7/24 (for deaths).
- Complete the **adverse event form** and submit it to Dr. Gray for review at Thursday feedback meetings.

### Recommended Textbooks
- **Core Topics in Paediatric Anaesthesia** by Walker & James.
- **A Practice of Anesthesia for Infants and Children** (Cote, 6th edition).

### Exit Interview
- All registrars must have an exit interview with Dr. Bester or Wilson before the end of their 3-month rotation. Arrange an appointment in the last 2 weeks of the rotation.

# Regional Anaesthesia

## Epidural/Wound Infusion Catheters (WIC)
- Counsel the patient or caregiver and provide an information leaflet (available in the **red folder**).
- Complete the **Epidural/WIC prescription form** (blue form in red file) and insert it into the patient’s nursing file before the drug prescription chart.
- Label the syringe and catheter with the patient’s sticker and grey LA stickers.
- Ensure the LA solution is connected to the catheter before leaving theatre.
- Ensure the infusion is running at the prescribed rate before leaving recovery.
- Refer the patient to the pain service via the provided Google doc link or QR code.

## PCA (Patient-Controlled Analgesia)
- Ensure all patients are properly assessed for maturity and understanding before using PCA.
- Educate the patient preoperatively and provide an information leaflet from the **blue file**.
- Follow the SOP in the **Google drive/blue file** to set up the PCA pump and mix the medications (morphine/fentanyl/ketamine).
- Label the cassette with the patient’s sticker and drug details.
- Prescribe PCA and antiemetics, e.g., **Morphine 25mg in 50mL saline IVI** and **Ondansetron 0.15mg/kg IV** PRN.
- Prescribe a stool softener if needed, e.g.,

 **Lactulose 0.5mL/kg PO 12-hourly**.
- Refer the patient to the pain service via the Google doc link or QR code.

## Caudal Anaesthesia
- Avoid in patients with abnormal sacral anatomy (e.g., spina bifida, previous myelomeningocele).
- Sterile procedure: scrub, wear a mask and sterile gloves.
- Add **Clonidine (1μg/kg)** to caudals in infants >4 months to prolong analgesia up to 12 hours.

### Landmarks
- Identify the sacral hiatus at the caudal end of the sacral crest, flanked by the bilateral sacral cornu.
- Position the patient laterally with the hip and knee bent at 90 degrees. The caudal space aligns with the lateral condyle of the knee.
