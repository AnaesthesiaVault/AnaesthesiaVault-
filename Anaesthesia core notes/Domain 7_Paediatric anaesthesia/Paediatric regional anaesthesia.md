# Principles of Regional Anaesthesia in Children
## Introduction

- **Optimal Analgesia:**
	- Ensures effective pain relief.
	- Opioid-sparing.
	- Beneficial effects on autonomic, metabolic, and immunological systems.
- **Benefits:**
	- Reduces the dose of general anaesthetic agents required.
	- Can be used as a sole anaesthetic technique or with minimal sedation (e.g., spinal anaesthesia).
- **Requirements:**
	- Understanding differences in anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and associated controversies between children and adults.
	- Essential for safe and effective performance of PRA.
## Anatomical Differences in Paediatric Regional Anaesthesia

### Central Nervous System
- **Growth Rate:** Vertebral column grows faster than the spinal cord during development.
- **Clinical Implications:**
	- Affects the relationship between surface landmarks and internal anatomy.
	- Important for performing central neuraxial blocks.
- **Age-Related Changes:**
### Developmental and Clinical Considerations of Spinal Anatomy in Different Age Groups

|Structure|Neonate|12-mo-old|Adult|Clinical Implication|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Spinal cord**|L3 or L4|L1|L1|In neonates and infants, subarachnoid block (SAB) should be performed at L4 or below to avoid direct trauma to the spinal cord.|
|**Termination of dural sac**|S3 or S4|S2|S2|In neonates, there is a higher risk of dural puncture. Frequent aspiration while injecting small aliquots of LA and US-guidance may help to reduce this risk.|
|**Bone**|L5-S1|L5-S1|L4-L5|In all age groups, surface landmarks influence the level of needle insertion. In neonates and infants, a steeper needle insertion angle is required when performing an epidural compared to neonates.|
|**Curvatures of the spine**|Single spinal curvature, high flexibility|Cervical curvature at 3-6 mo; lumbar curvature at 8-9 mo|Thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis present|In infants and neonates, due to lack of lumbar lordosis compared with adolescents and adults.|
|**Vertebrae**|Cartilaginous bones|Delayed ossification|Bones are ossified|In neonates and infants, sharp needles may traverse into bone, damaging ossification nuclei and increasing the risk of intraosseous LA injection. Short-bevel, blunt-tip needles can decrease this risk.|
|**Sacral vertebrae**|Incomplete fusion|Fusion begins by 8 y of age|Sacral bone fusion completes by 25 y of age|In neonates and infants, there is better US visualization of anatomy within the spinal canal (eg, spinal cord, nerve roots, dura). Sacral hiatus serves as portal of cordal injection until 6-8 y of age when fusion typically begins. Sacral epidural approaches are possible until fusion complete.|

### Differences in the Central Neuraxial Space Between Neonates, Infants, Children and Adults

| **Epidural fat/fascia/sheath/aponeurosis**                    | Increased fluidity of epidural fat and loosely attached fascia and sheaths                                                                         | Increased fluidity of fat up to 6-8 y of age; loose attachment of fascia, sheath and aponeurosis          | Paucity of epidural fat, increased fibrous tissue; firmly attached fascia, sheaths and aponeuroses | In neonates and infants, it is easier to thread epidural catheters several centimeters along the epidural space without resistance, allowing thoracic-level epidural catheters to be threaded from a caudal or lumbar level entry point. |
| **Ligament**                                                  | Less dense                                                                                                                                         | Less dense                                                                                                | Dense                                                                                              | In neonates and infants, there is leakage of LA around the nerve roots.                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Peripheral Nervous System
#### Age-Related Differences in Peripheral Nervous System Between Children and Adults

| Structure                          | Neonate           | Child                                | Adult                | Clinical Implication in Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Myelination**                    | Very immature     | Myelination completed by 12 y of age | Complete myelination | LA rapidly penetrates the nerves, producing fast-onset block. A low concentration of LA can achieve a high-quality dense block. Greater spread of LA produces a fast onset and high-quality block. LA is absorbed quickly away from the nerves, producing a shorter-duration block. |
| **Endoneurium**                    | Loose endoneurium | Loose endoneurium                    | Relatively firm      | The rapidity of onset and density of blocks as well as absorption of LA in and out of the nerves are inversely proportionate to age.                                                                                                                                                |

## Local Anaesthetic Choice
- **Amide LAs:**
	- Frequently used in PRA.
	- Ropivacaine and levobupivacaine: Less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine.
- **Ester LAs:**
	- Chloroprocaine: Metabolized efficiently by plasma cholinesterases.
	- Considered safer than amide LAs.
- **Pharmacokinetics Differences:**
## Pharmacokinetic and Clinical Implications of Local Anesthetics in Children

### Absorption
- Children exhibit higher cardiac output and reduced tissue binding, leading to increased systemic absorption of local anesthetics (LAs).
- With a higher volume of distribution due to their larger extracellular fluid volume, neonates need adjustments in LA dosages.
- The plasma concentration of α1-acid glycoprotein is lower in neonates (0.2–0.3 g/L at birth), reaching adult levels (0.7–1.0 g/L) by one year, impacting the unbound fraction of LAs which is greater in this population.
### Distribution
- The systemic and unbound availability of LAs is higher in children, influencing both efficacy and potential toxicity.
### Metabolism
- LAs like lignocaine and bupivacaine are initially metabolized by CYP3A7 in children, shifting to CYP3A4 metabolism by around 9 months of age.
- Ropivacaine and levobupivacaine are metabolized by CYP1A2 which remains immature until approximately 3 years, suggesting modified dosing or drug choice might be necessary for safety.
#### Clearance for LA Bolus Injection
- Children display a capacity for faster clearance of LAs after bolus injection; this ability improves significantly over 2 years of age, eventually exceeding adult clearance rates by adolescence.
- The elimination half-life of LAs post-bolus injection in children is prolonged compared to adults.
#### Clearance for Continuous Infusion
- Continuous infusion of LAs like lignocaine can lead to a substantial decrease in clearance rates due to its self-inhibition of metabolism, especially noted in neonates.
- Both bupivacaine and ropivacaine show protein binding-dependent clearance which is slower in children compared to adults, potentially raising the risk of accumulation and toxicity.
### Clinical Implications
- The pharmacokinetics of LAs in children can lead to a shorter duration of anesthetic action and an increased risk of systemic toxicity (LAST).
- Higher dosing requirements may be necessary for neonates post a single LA injection, but repeated doses heighten the risk of LAST due to accumulation.
- LAs with a higher free fraction in plasma (due to low α1-acid glycoprotein) in neonates and young children increase the potential for LAST.
- In neonates, the extended half-life of LAs like lignocaine when used in continuous infusion suggests increased systemic exposure and toxicity risk, making drugs like chloroprocaine or ropivacaine preferable due to their safer pharmacokinetic profiles in this population.
### Recommendations
- Avoid continuous infusion of LAs like lignocaine in infants; stop if initiated after 48 hours to mitigate LAST risk.
- For neonates, adjust LA dosages based on their unique pharmacokinetic profiles to avoid toxicity while ensuring effective anesthesia.
- Opt for LAs with better safety profiles such as chloroprocaine and ropivacaine in pediatric settings to reduce the risks associated with prolonged or excessive exposure.
- **Weight-Based Calculation:**
	- Essential for avoiding local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST).
### Local Anesthetic Dose Recommendations
#### Maximum Bolus Dose (mg/kg)
- **Ropivacaine:** 3
- **Bupivacaine:** 2
- **Levobupivacaine:** 3
- **Lidocaine:** 5 (10 with adrenaline)
- **2-Chloroprocaine:** 7 (10 with adrenaline)
- **Procaine:** 7 (10 with adrenaline)
#### Maximum Hourly Infusion Rate (mg/kg/h)

| Age Group              | Ropivacaine | Bupivacaine | Levobupivacaine | Lidocaine       | 2-Chloroprocaine        | Procaine        |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| **4 months to 1 year** | 0.25        | 0.25        | 0.25            | Not recommended | 10 (without adrenaline) | Not recommended |
| **1 to 4 years**       | 0.35        | 0.35        | 0.35            | Not recommended | 10 (without adrenaline) | Not recommended |
| **Over 4 years**       | 0.4         | 0.4         | 0.4             | Not recommended | 10 (without adrenaline) | Not recommended |

### Additives
- **Current Evidence:**
	- No strong evidence for routine use.
- **Popular Additives:**
	- Clonidine (1-2 µg/kg) or dexmedetomidine (1 µg/kg) to prolong analgesia.
	- Clonidine: Safe in central neuraxial blocks.
	- Both: Systemically absorbed, contributing to postoperative sedation.
- **Age Considerations:**
	- Avoid in preterm babies and infants <6 months due to systemic absorption and prolonged sedation.
- **Adrenaline:**
	- Not recommended due to risk of spinal cord ischaemia.
### Peripheral Nerve Catheters (PNCs)
- **Uses:**
	- Continuous analgesia for significant acute pain (postoperative, ischemic, amputation pain).
	- Reduce opioid requirements and associated adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, constipation, respiratory depression).
- **Advantages Over Single Injection Blocks:**
	- Prolonged duration of analgesia.
	- Reduced opioid requirements.
	- Earlier ambulation.
	- Shorter hospital stay.
- **Duration:**
	- Can be left in situ for up to 7 days.
	- Increased risk of catheter related infection beyond the fourth day.
	- Balance analgesic benefits against infection risk.
- **Complications:**
	- Catheter equipment failure (dislodgement, migration, blockage, leakage, disconnection).
	- Skin reactions from dressings.
	- Risks associated with single injection techniques (nerve injury, failed block, LAST).
### Equipment
- **Age-appropriate equipment:** Maximizes block success and minimizes inadvertent vascular or organ injury.
- **Ultrasound (US) guidance:**
	- Ensures accurate catheter placement.
	- Reduces risk of inadvertent vascular or organ injury.
	- Crucial for children due to superficial nerves and proximity to major structures.
- **Needle selection:**
	- Consider block depth and patient size.
	- Use a smaller gauge to minimize tissue trauma.
	- Shorter needle length maximizes control.
- **Needle type:**
	- Use a short bevel or Touhy needle to reduce nerve injury risk.
- **Catheter security:**
	- Secure carefully to prevent dislodgement.
	- Consider tunneling the catheter.
### Controversies
#### Awake Versus General Anaesthesia
- **Adults:** Awake or light sedation for early LAST detection and reduced intraneural injection risk.
- **Children:**
	- Awake or minimal sedation may cause distress and movement.
	- Frightened children unlikely to report LAST symptoms.
	- PRA under general anaesthesia or deep sedation has acceptable safety and is the standard of care according to American and European societies of regional anaesthesia.
#### Compartment Syndrome (CS)
- **Cause:** Increased pressure inside a fascial compartment, leading to impaired blood flow and potential muscle ischaemia and myonecrosis.
- **Concern:** PRA may mask pain, an early symptom of CS.
- **Recommendations:**
	- High suspicion and careful monitoring for CS.
	- Urgent assessment of compartment pressures if suspected.
	- Use dilute LA solutions (e.g., 0.1% ropivacaine) to avoid masking ischaemic pain and motor block.
	- Avoid additives to prevent increasing block density.
#### Saline Versus Air for Epidural Block
- **Techniques:**
	- **LOR to air:** Risks include:
		- air embolism
		- incomplete analgesia
		- nerve root compression
		- subcutaneous emphysema
		- pneumocephalus.
	- **LOR to saline:** Overcomes air risks but may dilute LA and cause transient reduction in cerebral blood flow in small infants. Difficult to differentiate saline from CSF.
	- **Combination of air and saline:** Minimizes risks and volume injected; lower dural puncture risk.
- **Recommendation:** Any technique acceptable if injected volume is minimized.
### Patients with Preexisting Neurologic Conditions
- **Benefits:**
	- Optimizes analgesia
	- minimizes opioid-related ventilatory impairment
	- reduces haemodynamic disturbances post-surgery.
- **Concerns:** Potential for new or worsened neurologic deficits due to LA neurotoxicity.
- **Recommendation:**
	- Preexisting neurologic disease not an absolute contraindication.
	- Document thorough neurological examination prior to PRA.
	- Conservative approach; weigh individual patient risks versus benefits.

### Liposomal Bupivacaine
- No superiority over nonliposomal bupivacaine in peripheral nerve blocks.
- Currently no role in paediatric regional analgesia; more evidence needed.
### Safety in Paediatric Regional Anaesthesia
#### Ultrasound (US) and Peripheral Nerve Stimulation
- **US Benefits:**
	- Visualizes needle tip and LA spread.
	- Minimizes risk of vascular/organ injury.
	- Faster onset, longer duration, increased block density, reduced LA volume.
	- Fewer needle insertions, better anatomy appreciation.
	- Linear high-frequency probes for most blocks in children.
- **Peripheral Nerve Stimulation:**
	- Useful adjunct with US guidance.
	- Adequate needle position: Muscle contraction at 0.5-0.8 mA.
	- Withdraw needle if contractions occur at <0.5 mA to avoid nerve damage/injection.
	- This technique is useful to:
		- improve reliability when teaching trainees
		- for deeper blocks when perfect nerve visualisation may not be possible (such as the lumbar plexus block, anterior sciatic block)
		- in low-resource settings where US equipment may not be available
#### Test Dosing
- **Purpose:** Identify inadvertent intravascular needle placement.
- **Paediatric Test Dose:**
	- 0.5 µg/kg of adrenaline or 0.1 mL/kg of LA with 5 µg/mL adrenaline.
	- Some institutions use 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline.
	- Positive test: Increase in heart rate (>10 bpm), systolic BP (>15 mm Hg), or 25% change in T-wave/ST segment.
	- Test doses have a high false-negative rate
- **Other Detection Methods:**
	- Aspiration for blood, observing LA spread on US.
	- Slow LA injection with intermittent aspiration while monitoring ECG.
#### Aseptic Precautions
- **Conditions:** Perform blocks under aseptic conditions.
- **Antiseptic Use:**
	- <2 months: Use alcohol to avoid chlorhexidine burns.
	- Older children: Use 2% chlorhexidine with 70% alcohol.
#### Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST)
- **Signs Under GA/Deep Sedation:**
	- Earliest signs: Cardiovascular (peaked T waves, dysrhythmias).
- **Highest Risk Group:**
	- Infants <6 months due to:
		- unrecognised intravascular injection
		- rapid absorption
		- distribution
		- decreased a1-acid glycoprotein levels.
- **Management:**
	- Familiarity with current LAST guidelines.
	- Adherence to weight-based dosing.
### Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)
- **ERAS Protocols:**
	- Multidisciplinary, multimodal, evidence-based pathways.
	- Designed to optimize perioperative care and facilitate early recovery.
- **Role of Regional Anaesthesia:**
	- Provides optimal analgesia.
	- Reduces opioid requirements.
	- Facilitates earlier return of bowel function and ambulation.
# Regional Anaesthesia in Paediatrics: Marching forward
### Pain Management in Paediatric Patients

#### Shift Towards Multimodal Pain Management
- **Current Practice:** Increasing use of regional anaesthesia techniques in infants and children.
- **Multimodal Analgesia:**
	- Advocates for opioids as rescue therapy, not first-line.
	- Important due to common and severe opioid side-effects in paediatric populations.
- **Benefits of Regional Anaesthesia:**
	- Alternative to general anaesthesia or reduction in GA drug doses.
- **Historical Context:**
	- Based on adult literature.
	- Paediatric-specific data now nearing critical value to guide practices.
#### Safety Issues
- **Primary Concern:** Patient safety in pain management for infants and children.
- **Role of Anaesthesia Providers:** Determine lowest risk intervention that provides adequate pain relief.
- **Data Sources:** Insights from two large databases with over 46,000 paediatric regional anaesthetics.
- **Safety Profile:**
	- Serious complication incidence: 0.12 to 0.15%.
		- Systemic/cardiac toxicity
		- apnoea
		- visceral puncture
		- dural puncture
		- nerve injury
		- infection requiring antibiotic therapy
		- hypotension
	- No mortalities or morbidities lasting >1 year.
- **Risks:** Catastrophic neurologic complications reported in small series and case reports.
- **Peripheral Nerve Blocks (PNB) vs. Neuraxial Techniques:**
	- **ADARPEF Data:** Serious complications incidence: Neuraxial (0.26%), Peripheral (0.04%).
	- **PRAN Data:** Serious complications incidence: Neuraxial (0.23%), Peripheral (0.02%).
	- 6-11 fold difference in serious events favors PNB placement when feasible.
- **Block Failure Rates:** Higher in neuraxial techniques compared to peripheral.
- **Ongoing Research:** Safety, reliability, and efficacy data will refine the roles of neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks.
### Use of Ultrasound in Paediatric Regional Anaesthesia

#### Impact of Ultrasound (US) Technology
- **Introduction:** 10 years since the first use in paediatric nerve blockade.
- **Benefits:**
	- Improved safety, reliability, and efficacy documented in adult studies.
	- Existing paediatric studies show trends towards:
		- faster onset
		- lower LA dose requirement
		- reduced block failure rates
- **Reduced Incidence of LAST:** Shown in several large adult studies.
- **Effects on Neurologic Injuries:** Promising trends in adult data, no paediatric-specific data available.
#### Specific Regional Techniques
- **Thoracoabdominal Blocks:**
	- **Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block:**
		- Introduced in 2008 for paediatric patients.
		- Initially used as a single-shot technique, now includes continuous catheter techniques.
		- Alternative to caudal and epidural blocks for lower abdominal surgeries.
		- Comparisons between TAP blocks, local infiltration and caudal analgesia favor TAP block for longer duration of analgesia.
		- Variations include lateral, posterior, subcostal, quadratus lumborum, transversalis fascia approaches.
			- each results in different dermatomal distribution and duration of analgesia.
	- **Paravertebral Nerve Block (PVNB):**
		- Introduced in 1992, remains underutilized but experiencing renewed interest.
		- Can be bilateral or unilateral for thoracic or abdominal surgeries.
		- Comparable analgesia to thoracic epidural with fewer side-effects and higher success rate.
		- Contrary to adult data showing better dermatomal spread when injections into the paravertebral space are made at multiple levels, in children, a single paravertebral injection at a low thoracic level of 0.3–0.5 ml/kg covers a median of six to eight paravertebral spaces.
#### Continuous Catheters
- **Feasibility and Efficacy:**
	- Established in paediatric patients, making up 35-75% of all paediatric regional anesthetics.
- **Advantages:**
	- Prolonged analgesia duration and titration to desired effect.
	- Does not increase the incidence of serious complications.
- **Outpatient Use:**
	- Increasing use with disposable ambulatory infusion pumps.
	- Benefits:
		- decreased hospital stay
		- decreased opioid consumption
		- decreased opoid related side-effects
		- decreased costs.
	- Outpatient perineural catheters exceed those performed on inpatients in some institutions.
### Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
- **Patient Safety:** Primary concern in pain management plans.
- **Insight from Large Databases:**
	- Over 46,000 paediatric regional anaesthetics with serious complications ranging from 0.12 to 0.15%.
	- Peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) show lower complication rates compared to neuraxial techniques.
- **Regional Block Failure:** Higher in neuraxial techniques.
- **Ongoing Research:** Will continue to refine roles of neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks.
### General Anaesthesia Sparing Properties of Regional Anaesthesia
#### Practice Differences
- **Paediatric Patients:** Majority receive regional anaesthesia in addition to general anaesthesia (GA).
- **Exceptions:** Spinal and caudal anaesthesia used alone in high-risk neonates and infants.
- **Benefits of regional pnly technique in High-Risk Neonates and Infants:**
	- Decreases postoperative apnoea.
	- Reduces need for postoperative ventilator support.
	- Provides hemodynamic stability in infants with major comorbidities, including cyanotic and non-cyanotic congenital heart disease.
#### Neuroapoptosis Concerns
- **GA Concerns:** Developing brain tissue shows neuroapoptosis after GA, potentially causing long-term behavioural and intellectual sequelae.
- **Regional Anaesthesia Benefits:**
	- Increasingly desirable as a solo anaesthetic to avoid GA in infants and young children.
	- Well tolerated and effective when used without GA for surgical procedures, though underutilized.
	- Supplementing GA with regional anaesthesia reduces exposure to GA medications.
### Regional Anaesthesia for Nonsurgical Pain
#### Current Use
- **Perioperative Period:** Most common use of paediatric regional anaesthesia.
- **Expanded Use:** Incremental use for localized pain from neuropathic sources, trauma, and painful medical conditions (acute and chronic).
#### Research and Effectiveness
- **Importance:** Promising area of research for treating medical and chronic pain in children, which is often difficult to manage.
- **Current Research:** Limited to a handful of case reports and small series.
- **Potential:** Additional effective therapies through regional techniques are highly welcomed in managing nonsurgical pain.
