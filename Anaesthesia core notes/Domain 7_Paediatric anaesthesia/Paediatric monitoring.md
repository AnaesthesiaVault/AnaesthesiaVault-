# Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring in Paediatric Neurosurgery

### Background on Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring (IONM) in Pediatric Neurosurgery
- **History**:
	- IONM in children first described in 1979, shortly after somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were introduced in adult spine surgery.
	- SSEPs were adopted to monitor scoliosis surgery, but postoperative deficits still occurred, leading to the introduction of motor evoked potentials (MEPs).
- **Main IONM Modalities**:
	- **Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs)**: Assess sensory pathways.
	- **Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs)**: Evaluate the corticospinal tract and alpha-motor neurons.
	- **Electromyography (EMG)**: Monitors muscle activity.
	- **Auditory Brainstem Evoked Responses (ABR)**: Evaluates auditory pathways.
	- **Direct Cortical and Subcortical Stimulation (DCS, DsCS)**: Assesses cortical and subcortical brain activity.
	- **Electroencephalography (EEG)**: Monitors brain electrical activity.
- **Impact of Anesthetic Agents**:
	- **Volatile Agents**: Have the greatest negative impact on IONM modalities.
	- **Intravenous Agents**: Generally have less deleterious effects, with etomidate potentially enhancing certain potentials.
	- **MEPs**: Most susceptible to anesthetic effects.
	- **SSEPs**: Intermediate sensitivity.
	- **ABRs and EMG**: Least affected by anesthetics; neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBs) can improve SSEPs and ABRs by eliminating EMG artifacts but will ablate MEPs and EMG.
- **Challenges in Pediatric IONM**:
	- **Neurological Immaturity in Infants/Toddlers**: Incomplete myelination, reduced conduction velocities, and fewer monosynaptic connections make data acquisition challenging and increase sensitivity to anesthetic agents.
	- **Maturation**: Sensitivity to anesthetics decreases with age, approaching adult levels in young, healthy children.
	- **Comorbidities and Genetic Conditions**: Can affect IONM data acquisition and increase sensitivity to anesthetics, complicating anesthetic choices.
- **Understanding IONM Modalities**:
	- A basic understanding of the origin and limitations of each IONM modality is crucial for their application in pediatric neurosurgery.
### Anesthetic Agents and Their Effects on IONM Modalities
#### **IONM Modalities**
- SSEP (cortical)
- SSEP (peripheral/subcortical; p/sc)
- Transcranial Motor Evoked Potentials (TcMEP)
- Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR)
- Electromyography (EMG)
#### **Effects Of Anesthetic Agents on IONM Modalities**

| Anesthetic Agent           | SSEP (cortical) | SSEP (p/sc) | TcMEP            | ABR         | EMG           |
|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Desflurane                  | DDA/DDL         | NSE         | DDA<sup>b</sup>  | NSE         | NSE           |
| Sevoflurane                 | DDA/DDL         | NSE         | DDA<sup>c</sup>  | NSE         | NSE           |
| Propofol                    | DDA/DDL         | NSE         | DDA<sup>d</sup>  | NSE         | NSE           |
| Etomidate                   | LDE             | NSE         | LDE              | NSE         | NSE           |
| Ketamine                    | LDE             | NSE         | LDE              | NSE         | NSE           |
| Dexmedetomidine             | NSE             | NSE         | DDA              | NSE         | NSE           |
| Remifentanil/Sufentanil     | NSE             | NSE         | NSE              | NSE         | NSE           |
| Neuromuscular Blockers (NMBs) | NSE<sup>a</sup> | a         | DDA<sup>e</sup>  | a           | DDA<sup>f</sup> |

**Notes:**
- **DDA**: Dose-dependent depression of amplitude.
- **DDL**: Dose-dependent increase in latency.
- **LDE**: Low doses enhance amplitude (minimal effect on latency).
- **NSE**: No significant effect in clinically used doses.
- **a**: May improve signal quality by eliminating EMG artifact.
- **b**: Effects significant above 0.5 MAC in older children.
- **c**: Effects greater than desflurane; very low concentrations can ablate MEPs in children under 4 years of age.
- **d**: Effects less than volatile agents, but bolus dosing or high blood levels will attenuate MEP amplitude.
- **e**: Ideally avoided when obtaining TcMEPs, especially in young children.
- **f**: To be avoided when performing CN EMG, especially CN VII.
### Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs)
- **Production**:
	- Generated by stimulating mixed peripheral nerves with brief current pulses.
	- Stimulates large sensory fibers transmitting proprioception.
- **Pathway**:
	- Impulses travel through the brachial (upper limb) or sacral plexus (lower limb), dorsal root entry zone, and ascend in the dorsal column to gracile (lower extremity) or cuneate (upper extremity) nucleus
	- Crosses midline as arcuate fibers, travels in medial lemniscus to vetral posterior lateral thalamic tier, and then to primary sensory cortex.
- **Recording**:
	- Time-locked stimulus and recording windows facilitate signal capture.
	- Typical cortical SSEP amplitude is about a microvolt, requiring signal averaging against background EEG, with an amplitude on the order of tens of microvolts.
- **Commonly Stimulated Nerves**:
	- Ulnar, median, and posterior tibial nerves.
	- Recording sites include Erb’s point, cervical spine, and cephalic locations (Fz, C3’, C4’).
- **Latency**:
	- Latency depends on conduction velocity, pathway length, and synapse number.
	- Affected by age, development, height, temperature, and anesthesia.
	- Peripheral and subcortical latencies/amplitudes are less affected by anesthesia; cortical latencies/amplitudes are more affected.

### Transcranial Motor Evoked Potentials (TcMEPs)
- **Production**:
	- Recorded from muscle groups in response to electrical pulses between electrodes on the scalp over the motor cortex.
	- Multiple pulses needed under general anesthesia to elicit motor responses.
- **Pathway**:
	- Pulses depolarize the largest axons of the corticospinal tract (CST), producing D-waves and cortical I-waves.
	- D-waves travel along CST fibers; I-waves require multiple pulses for generation under anesthesia.
	- Sufficient excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) depolarize alpha-motor neurons (aMNs).
- **Anesthetic Effects**:
	- Suppresses I-wave generation, depresses aMN resting membrane potential, and reduces EPSP voltage.
	- Anesthetic choice can affect false-positive rates for neurological deficits.
	- Infants/toddlers require greater charge and different stimulation protocols due to immature neurological connections.
- **Direct Cortical Stimulation**:
	- Different conditions compared to transcranial stimulation; absence of scalp, skull, and dura resistance.
	- Activates single or closely associated muscles instead of multiple muscles.
- **Subcortical Motor Tract Mapping**:
	- Direct stimulation of CST axons in white matter to map motor tracts.
	- Stimulating current correlates with distance to CST; low currents indicate proximity and risk of motor pathway injury during surgery.
	![[A794C87B-2EA5-4449-8718-19320EDC13E1.jpeg]]
### Auditory Brainstem Evoked Responses (ABRs)
- **Latency Responses**:
	- Divided into short-, medium-, and long-latency responses.
	- Only short-latency responses (waves I–V) are relevant under anesthesia.
- **Wave Origins**:
	- **Wave I**: Activation of the distal cochlea.
	- **Wave II**: Activation of the proximal cochlea.
	- **Wave III**: Activation of the cochlear nucleus.
	- **Wave IV**: Putative origin from the lateral lemniscus.
	- **Wave V**: Entry of lateral lemniscus into the inferior colliculus.
- **Procedure**:
	- Repetitive click presented to one ear, masking noise to the other.
	- Responses recorded from the vertex with an earlobe or mastoid reference.
	- Normal latencies are very short, with a recording window of 10 ms.
	- Signals have low amplitude, requiring time-locking to the stimulus and extensive signal averaging (up to 4000 sweeps).
- **Clinical Use**:
	- Measures auditory nerve function.
	- Serves as a surrogate marker for brainstem perfusion; waves III–V decrease in amplitude with poor perfusion or brainstem retraction.
### Electromyography (EMG)
- **Purpose**:
	- Records electrical activity produced by muscles, which can be regular or irregular.
	- Activity may result from motor neuron activity, nerve irritation/injury, or absence of neuronal input.
- **Patterns of Activity**:
	- **Regular**: Single spikes (e.g., fibrillation potentials), complex repetitive discharges, myotonic discharges.
	- **Irregular**: Burst patterns at varying intervals.
- **Clinical Interpretation**:
	- Spontaneous EMG in an anesthetized patient may indicate inadequate anesthesia, passive movement artifact, or pathological activity.
	- Abnormal activity can arise from denervated muscle, muscle disease, or neurotonic activity (commonly due to nerve injury).
	- Firing rate and amplitude are proportional to the energy (heat or mechanical) absorbed by the nerve.
	- Sharp nerve transection may not produce an EMG response; stimulation distal to the cut may still show a normal response.
- **Applications**:
	- EMG recorded from muscles innervated by cranial nerves during intracranial procedures and from somatic muscles in other neurosurgical procedures.
	- Facial nerve (CN VII) EMG is common in cerebellopontine angle surgeries and has prognostic significance for postoperative facial nerve function.
	- Avoid neuromuscular blocking agents when recording CN EMG, as cranial nerve-innervated muscles are more sensitive to NMBs than somatic muscles.

### Why Utilize IONM in Pediatric Neurosurgery?
- **Neuronavigation Limitations**:
	- Neuronavigation is dependent on stable intracranial structure positions relative to fiducials.
	- Neuronavigation does not provide functional information, whereas IONM assesses functional integrity of specific brain pathways.
- **Current IONM Limitations**:
	- Cannot assess cranial nerve afferents except CN VIII (via ABRs).
	- SSEPs do not assess sensory modalities like temperature, pressure, or sharp-dull discrimination.
	- MEPs may not detect significant injury to basal ganglia.
	- Cannot assess language processing under anesthesia; requires preoperative fMRI or asleep-awake-asleep craniotomy.
- **IONM Benefits**:
	- Guides surgeons during complex procedures for more complete resections and better outcomes.
	- Particularly useful in complex tethered cord release, selective dorsal rhizotomies, spinal cord tumor resections, and brain tumors near motor cortex pathways.
### Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR)

- **Purpose**:
	- Performed in children with spastic diplegia to improve gait by reducing spasticity.
- **IONM Application**:
	- Triggered EMG is used to monitor responses from lower extremity muscles and anal sphincters.
	- Appropriate anaesthesia depth is critical to avoid movement and ensure effective monitoring.
	- Rootlets are stimulated and graded based on their response to determine which to cut or spare.
	- Outcomes are generally good when SDR is combined with intensive postoperative physical therapy.
### Resection of Intramedullary Spinal Cord Tumors
- **Risks**:
	- High risk of permanent motor tract injury during resection.
- **IONM Techniques**:
	- TcMEPs, D-waves, and CST mapping are ideal for monitoring during resection.
	- D-wave amplitude is tracked to assess the health of CST fibers.
	- Loss of TcMEPs with >50% of baseline D-wave amplitude indicates temporary deficits; <50% suggests permanent deficits.
	- Preserving D-wave amplitude allows more complete tumor resection.
### Resection of Intracranial Tumors
- **Tumor Location**:
	- Tumors may be near areas involved in generating IONM potentials or in regions with vascular supply risks.
- **IONM Role**:
	- Changes in cortical SSEPs during surgery can indicate potential issues.
	- Stable anesthesia levels are crucial to avoid confusing anesthesia effects with surgical causes.
	- TcMEP parameters must be carefully adjusted to avoid false negatives.
	- Special techniques can obtain TcMEPs from facial, vocalis, and tongue muscles, and CN EMG can map the floor of the fourth ventricle.
### Safety and IONM
- **Hazards**:
	- Needle-stick injuries are a risk for OR team members when using subdermal needles.
	- Bite injuries to the tongue are common during TcMEPs due to masseter muscle contraction, especially in the prone position.
- **Precautions**:
	- Use and proper placement of bite blocks can reduce bite injuries.
	- Burn injuries can occur at needle sites if IONM leads run parallel and close to electrocautery cables.
	- Ensure IONM leads cross electrocautery cables at right angles or are sufficiently separated to avoid induced currents.

# Neonatal Monitoring

- **Monitoring Standards**:
	- Same minimum monitoring standards for adults apply to neonates.
	- Medical practitioners must ensure that appropriate equipment for neonatal care is available.
	- If equipment is unavailable, transfer the baby to a suitable institution or source the necessary equipment.
- **ASA Monitoring Standards**:
	1. **Qualified Personnel**: Anaesthesia personnel must monitor the patient.
	2. **Oxygenation, Ventilation, Circulation, and Temperature**: Evaluated regularly, including:
		- Inspiratory oxygen (FiO2) with a low-limit alarm.
		- Arterial saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) with audible pulse and low-limit alarm.
		- Visual inspection of the patient's color.
		- Capnography (EtCO2) if possible.
		- Respirometry is strongly encouraged.
		- Disconnection alarm when positive pressure ventilation is used
		- Electrocardiography (ECG).
		- Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) checked at least every 5 minutes.
		- Presence of a pulse.
- **Additional Monitoring Considerations**:
	- **Temperature**: Neonates are at risk of hypothermia, making regular temperature monitoring mandatory except for the shortest cases.
	- **Blood Glucose**: Monitor for hypoglycemia risk, necessitating blood glucose measurement.
- **Invasive Monitoring**:
	- Poses special challenges with a potentially higher risk-to-benefit ratio.
	- Discussed further under haemodynamic monitoring.
- **Monitoring Goals**:
	- Consider the specific target values for neonatal monitoring.
### 1. Evidence for Neonatal Monitoring
- **Monitoring Standards**:
	- Mostly based on expert opinion.
	- A review of ICU neonatal monitoring shows frequent use of HR, ECG, non-invasive and invasive BP, atrial pressure, SpO2, and EtCO2 without strong evidence.
	- Expert opinion supports routine monitoring of SpO2 and EtCO2 in the ICU.
	- Invasive BP monitoring is indicated in shocked neonates; HR, ECG, and atrial pressure are relevant in specific settings (e.g., post-cardiac surgery).
- **ECG in Neonates**:
	- Not critical in ICU settings but valuable in theatre, especially during rapid physiological changes (e.g., laparotomy for necrotizing enterocolitis).
	- ECG can detect arrhythmias from sudden reperfusion or hypocalcemia due to massive transfusion.
- **Frequent Clinical Assessment**:
	- Essential due to unclear normal values in neonates.
	- Clinical condition and trends in parameters may be more relevant than isolated measurements.
### 2. Haemodynamic Monitoring

![[903BD4AF-D89D-4865-88DA-ADC96E38ED2F.jpeg]]

- **Non-Invasive BP (NIBP) Monitoring**:
	- **Cuff Size**: Cuff width should be 0.44-0.55 of limb circumference for accurate readings.
	- **Measurement Site**: Arm measurements showed similar accuracy, though newer studies refute this.
	- **Accuracy**:
		- Older studies: NIBP overestimates BP at low pressures.
		- Newer studies: NIBP can be accurate, with systolic NIBP correlating best with invasive measurements; diastolic measurements show poor correlation in neonates.
		- NIBP is good for trending systolic pressure but may show bias at lower pressures.
- **Cardiac Output (CO)**:
	- CO is likely more important than BP in neonates; rarely measured.
	- CO-BP relationship implies that CO may increase as BP decreases in some conditions.
- **Normal Neonatal BP**:
	- Term neonate:
		- First 24 hours: 62.6 mmHg systolic.
		- After 36 hours: 68.4 mmHg systolic.
		- By the end of the first week: 72/51 mmHg.
	- Hypotension:
		- Difficult to define, especially in premature neonates.
		- Common references: minimum mean BP of 30 mmHg, mean BP equal to gestational age in weeks, or the 10th percentile for ageand birth weight-specific reference values.
- **Hypotension and Hypoperfusion**:
	- Hypotension is not always a reliable marker of hypoperfusion in neonates.
	- Some studies show no association between hypotension and neurodevelopmental outcomes.
	- Cerebral autoregulation is unpredictable; dopamine may increase BP without improving cerebral perfusion (measured by NIRS).
	- Low cerebral NIRS (<50%) correlates with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes.
- **Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)**:
	- Useful in neonates and small children due to limited depth of penetration not being a limiting factor.
	- **Normal Cerebral NIRS Values**: 60-80%; values <50% indicate oxygen debt and correlate with neurodevelopmental outcomes.
	- **Somatic-Cerebral Gradient**: Normal range is 10-15%; narrowing suggests early shock before decompensation.
- **Capillary Refill Time (CRT)**:
	- CRT >3 seconds suggests poor perfusion, with 55% sensitivity and 81% specificity for predicting low SVC flow.
	- Best measured on the chest.
	- CRT >4 seconds combined with lactate >4 correlates strongly with low SVC flow.
- **Additional Haemodynamic Monitoring Methods**:
	- **Capillary Refill Time (CRT)**: Indicator of perfusion.
	- **Central-Peripheral Temperature Difference (ΔTC-P)**: Performs poorly as a perfusion indicator.
	- **Pulsatility Index (PI)**: Measured by pulse oximeter; correlates with SVC flow (BP, CRT, and ΔTC-P do not correlate).
	- **Other Monitoring Methods**:
		- Urine output.
		- Base deficit, serum lactate.
		- Arterial ultrasound probes.
		- Echocardiography.
		- Pulse wave analysis.
		- Impedance cardiography.
		- Dilution techniques.
		- Laser Doppler.
- **Central Venous Saturation (ScvO2)**:
	- Indicates oxygen extraction and is useful for calculating the oxygen extraction ratio in cyanotic patients.
	- Normal ScvO2 values vary by sampling site:
		- SVC: 70-75%.
		- Internal jugular vein: 65-70%.
		- IVC (IVC-right atrial junction): 80-85%.
	- Femoral venous lines measure right atrial pressure but not venous saturation.
- **Venous-Arterial CO2 Difference**:
	- A potential marker of inadequate perfusion, with a suggested cutoff value of 6 mmHg.
### 3. Risks of Arterial and Venous Cannulae in Neonates

#### **Arterial Cannulation Risks**

- **General Risks**: Thrombosis, ischemia, extravasation; these risks are amplified in neonates.
	
- **Radial Artery**:
	- **Advantages**: Benefits from collateral circulation.
	- **Challenges**: Technically difficult to cannulate in very small neonates.
	- **Note**: Radial BP may be significantly lower than aortic BP post-cardiopulmonary bypass or during vasopressor use.
- **Brachial Artery**:
	- **Risks**: No collateral circulation; risk of median nerve injury.
- **Axillary Artery**:
	- **Advantages**: Extensive collateral circulation; good indicator of aortic pressure.
	- **Risks**: Technically challenging; risk of brachial plexus injury due to extravasation into the axillary sheath.
- **Femoral Artery**:
	- **Advantages**: Good collateral supply; catheters last longer than radial catheters due to vessel size.
	- **Risks**: Risk of undetected extraperitoneal hemorrhage; complications increase with longer catheter use and smaller patient size.
	- **Complications**: Acceptable perfusion-related complications (2.4-25% incidence); decreased perfusion can usually be reversed by removing the catheter.
- **Long-Term Complications**: Potential for upper or lower limb shortening due to growth plate arrest from arterial cannulation during infancy.
#### **Venous Cannulation Risks**

- **Thrombosis**:
	- Almost all neonatal venous thrombi are associated with indwelling venous cannulae.
	- **Incidence**: 9-30% of neonates with central venous lines develop thrombosis, which may be asymptomatic.
	- **Causes**: Small vessels, low levels of coagulation/inhibitor proteins, and conditions like asphyxia.
	- **Note**: Insertion site does not significantly influence the risk of thrombosis.
- **Misplaced Lines**:
	- **Femoral Venous Lines**: Can be misplaced in the ascending lumbar vein, more commonly on the left side.
	- **Suspected Misplacement Indicators**:
		- Inability to aspirate blood.
		- Lateral deviation of catheter at L4/5 on abdominal x-ray.
		- Catheter appears over the vertebral column on x-ray, rather than to the right of midline.
- **Right Atrium Catheter Placement**:
	- **Risks**: Possible association with pericardial effusions over time.
	- **Note**: Audit of 2000 patients showed no pericardial effusions with catheter tips in the right atrium, though most case reports of pericardial effusion involve catheters placed in the right atrium.
- **Heparin Infusion**:
	- Recommended by physicians to prevent catheter occlusion and prolong catheter use.
	- **Dosage**: 0.5 IU/hr to 0.5 IU/kg/hr.
### 4. Capnography in Neonates
- **Utility**:
	- Provides information on anaesthetic equipment function, airway, breathing, cardiovascular, and metabolic function.
	- Hypocapnia is linked to poor clinical outcomes in adults and children.
	- Hypoand hypercarbia in premature neonates can lead to complications such as periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and chronic lung disease.
	- Extreme CO2 fluctuations are associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes.
- **Accuracy Challenges**:
	- Leaks, dead space in equipment relative to tidal volume, and poor lung function reduce EtCO2 accuracy.
	- Arterial to end-tidal CO2 gradients vary from 3 mmHg to 14.8 mmHg, but EtCO2 still provides valuable trend data in neonates.
- **Capnography Types**:
	- **Mainstream Capnography**: More accurate with additional dead space as low as 1 mL.
	- **Side Stream Capnography**: Microsampling (50 mL/min) is more accurate in neonates than conventional side stream sampling (150-200 mL/min).
- **Transcutaneous EtCO2**:
	- Very accurate in premature babies, particularly useful during transport or high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.
	- Probe needs to be re-sited regularly to prevent skin damage or burns.
### 5. Saturation Monitoring in Neonates
- **Risks**:
	- Both hyperoxia and hypoxia are detrimental.
	- **Hyperoxia**: Associated with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
	- **Hypoxia**: Increased mortality in premature neonates targeted for SpO2 of 85-89% compared to those targeted for 91-95%.
- **Recommended SpO2 Range**:
	- **Sola et al.** recommend a target SpO2 range of 87-94% in neonates receiving supplemental oxygen.
	- Sola also recommends avoiding pre-oxygenation in neonates of any gestational age, even for short periods, though this is challenging in practice.
- **SpO2 Monitor Accuracy**:
	- Accurate within 2% when SaO2 >90%.
	- Overreads increasingly at lower saturations, common in children with congenital heart disease.
- **New Generation SpO2 Monitors**:
	- **Features**: Include signal extraction technology and motion artifact elimination, recommended for use over conventional monitors.
- **Practical Considerations**:
	- SpO2 monitors are prone to signal loss; using two pulse oximeters is advised during surgery on small children.
	- **Probes**:
		- Wrap-around probes are advisable for neonates.
		- Adult clip-on probes may reduce perfusion, decrease accuracy, and cause pressure damage when used on neonate feet.
### Temperature Monitoring in Neonates
- **Thermoregulation**: Crucial in neonates.
- **Burn Risk**: Neonates are at higher risk of burn injuries, including those caused by forced air warmers.
### Glucose Monitoring in Neonates
- **Hypoglycemia Risk**:
	- Neonates are at increased risk of hypoglycemia, though it may be part of normal physiological adaptation.
	- Healthy fasting neonates can produce lactate and ketones to spare glucose.
	- Specific groups at higher risk include septic, hypoxic-ischemic neonates, and those with certain perinatal conditions:
- **Risk Factors and Incidence of Neonatal Hypoglycemia**:
	- **Preterm or Late Preterm Infants**: 15-67%.
	- **Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR)**: 18-72%.
	- **Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW)**: Up to 50%.
	- **Extremely Low Birth Weight (ELBW)**: Up to 70%.
	- **Large for Gestational Age (LGA)**: 4-38%.
	- **Infants of Diabetic Mothers**: Up to 50%.
- **Hyperglycemia Risk**:
	- Common in premature neonates due to insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency.
	- Linked to retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, and mortality in retrospective studies.
- **Challenges in Glucose Monitoring**:
	- **Definition of Hypoglycemia**: Ill-defined, ranging from <1.67 to <3.33 mmol/L (most commonly <2.6 mmol/L).
	- **Factors Causing Inaccuracy**:
		- High hematocrit (common in neonates) can cause false low glucose readings.
		- Metabolic acidosis, high oxygen tension, hyperbilirubinemia, and edema can also affect accuracy.
	- **Point-of-Care Devices**: Limited accuracy at low glucose ranges, with potential errors of up to 1.1 mmol/L.
	- **Recommendation**: Any point-of-care glucose value <3.2 mmol/L should be considered as potentially hypoglycemic.
