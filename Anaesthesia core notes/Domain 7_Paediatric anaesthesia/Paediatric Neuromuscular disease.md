# Neuromuscular Disorders and Anaesthesia: Generic Anaesthetic Management
## Introduction
- **Importance for Anaesthetists**:
	- Neuromuscular disorders pose significant concerns for anaesthetists, intensivists, and the primary medical or surgical team.
	- Understanding the pathophysiology of each condition is crucial for effective preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative planning.
- **Diagnosis and Planning**:
	- Ideal to have a precise diagnosis before anaesthesia, but sometimes anaesthesia is needed for muscle biopsy to complete investigations.
	- Plan for potential complications associated with high morbidity and mortality, focusing on prevention and management.
- **History of Neuromuscular Disease**:
	- First described in 1836 by Conte in Naples, Italy.
	- Edward Meyron and Guillaume Armand Duchenne de Boulogne significantly contributed to understanding muscular dystrophies.
	- Myotonia congenita described by Dr Thomsen in 1876; myotonic dystrophy, the most common myotonic syndrome, identified by Steinert in 1909.
- **Classification**:
	- Neuromuscular disorders are heterogeneous, affecting skeletal muscle via abnormalities at multiple sites.
	- Can be classified as hereditary or acquired and anatomically based on the site of disease (pre-junctional, junctional, or post-junctional):
	- **Hereditary Neuromuscular Disorders**:
		- **Pre-Junctional Disorders**:
			- **Peripheral Neuropathies**:
				- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease
				- Friedrich's Ataxia
		- **Post-Junctional Disorders**:
			- **Dystrophic Disorders**:
				- Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
				- Becker’s Muscular Dystrophy
			- **Myotonic Disorders**:
				- Myotonic Dystrophy
				- Myotonia Congenita
			- **Periodic Paralysis Disorders**:
				- Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis
				- Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis
			- **Metabolic/Mitochondrial Disorders**
	- **Acquired Neuromuscular Disorders**:
		- **Pre-Junctional Disorders**:
			- Motor Neurone Disease
			- Multiple Sclerosis
			- Guillain–Barré Syndrome
			- Peripheral Neuropathies (e.g., due to Diabetes Mellitus)
		- **Junctional Disorders**:
			- Myasthenia Gravis
			- Eaton–Lambert Syndrome
		- **Post-Junctional Disorders**:
			- Inflammatory Myopathies
			- Critical Illness Polyneuropathy and Myopathy
	
- ## Preoperative Management:
	- A thorough history and examination, especially of respiratory and cardiac function, is essential.
	- High incidence of respiratory complications due to involvement of respiratory/pharyngeal muscles, spinal deformities, and difficult airways.
	- Patients may be unaware of underlying cardiac dysfunction due to limited physical activity.
	- Investigations should assess physiological reserve:
		- ECG
		- CXR
		- echocardiogram
		- pulmonary function tests
		- baseline arterial blood gases
		- blood tests (haematology, urea, electrolytes, creatinine kinase).
- **Premedication**:
	- Can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the patient.
	- Short-acting agents like benzodiazepines may be ideal for managing anxiety-induced muscle spasms (due to catecholamine release).
	- Avoid or reduce doses of agents that cause central respiratory depression or reduce respiratory muscle tone; close monitoring is essential.
## Perioperative Management
- **Monitoring**:
	- Standard monitoring: ECG, oxygen saturation, capnography.
	- Consider invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring for unstable patients and blood sampling.
- **Thermoregulation**:
	- **Hypothermia**:
		- Risk due to reduced heat production from immobile muscles.
		- Exacerbated by peripheral vasodilation from anaesthesia.
		- Maintain normothermia with warmed fluids and forced air warmers.
		- Hypothermia can:
			- worsen myotonia
			- increase sensitivity to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents
			- aggravate rhabdomyolysis.
	- **Hyperthermia**:
		- Risk from increased muscle activity, iatrogenic causes, or malignant hyperthermia.
		- Be vigilant in patients with muscular dystrophies and myotonias.
		- Signs: unexplained tachycardia and increased end-tidal CO2; treat aggressively.
- **Regional Anaesthesia**:
	- Beneficial for patients with significant respiratory or cardiac involvement.
	- Avoid in rapidly progressing neurological conditions to distinguish block effects from disease progression.
	- Watch for autonomic dysfunction, requiring invasive monitoring and careful titration of agents.
- **General Anaesthesia**:
	- **Volatile Agents**:
		- Controversial due to association with malignant hyperthermia in some disorders like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
		- Total i.v. anaesthesia with a clean anaesthetic machine recommended to avoid rhabdomyolysis.
		- Volatile agents may cause cardiovascular decompensation.
	- **I.V. Anaesthesia**:
		- Offers benefits with short-acting, easily controlled agents.
		- Caution due to potential autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular collapse.
- **Neuromuscular Block**:
	- **Depolarizing Agents** (e.g., Succinylcholine):
		- Not recommended due to risk of hyperkalaemia, muscle fibre swelling, and rhabdomyolysis.
		- Can cause temperomandibular muscle spasm in myotonias, preventing intubation and ventilation.
		- May be used in myasthenia gravis with increased dose required.
	- **Non-Depolarizing Agents**:
		- Use caution due to sensitivity in neuromuscular disorders, which can result in respiratory weakness and complications.
		- If necessary, use reduced doses (10-20% of recommended).
		- Preferred agents: mivacurium and atracurium due to their degradation process.
	- **Anticholinesterases**:
		- Not recommended in muscular dystrophies due to risk of hyperkalaemia.
## Postoperative Management
- **Admission & Monitoring**:
	- Patients are unsuitable for day case surgery; planned admission is essential.
	- Postoperative admission to high dependency or ICU is mandatory.
	- Ensure access to physiotherapy, positive pressure circuits, and appropriate analgesia.
- **Complications**:
	- **Rhabdomyolysis**:
		- Risk with depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and some volatile agents.
		- Causes include muscle ion distribution changes, sustained muscle contractions, and muscle damage.
		- Signs: metabolic acidosis, hyperkalaemia, myoglobinuria, elevated creatinine kinase (>10,000 units/L).
		- Treatment:
			- stop causative drugs
			- correct hyperkalaemia
			- aggressive volume resuscitation
			- consider sodium bicarbonate and dantrolene for hyperthermia.
	- **Autonomic Dysfunction**:
		- Can cause severe hypotension on induction and post-regional anaesthesia.
		- Risk of gastric dysmotility, regurgitation, and aspiration.
		- Sympathomimetic drugs should be available, with reduced doses due to increased receptor sensitivity.
	- **Myotonias**:
		- Triggered by agents like succinylcholine, anticholinesterases, opioids, and environmental factors (temperature, acidosis, shivering).
		- Myotonic contractures are not responsive to neuromuscular block.
		- Management includes correcting environmental factors and using sodium channel blockers (local anesthetics, antiarrhythmic agents).
	- **Cardiac & Respiratory Complications**:
		- **Cardiac**: Cardiomyopathies, conduction abnormalities, and arrhythmias are risks; treat as high cardiac risk with invasive monitoring and inotropic support.
		- **Respiratory**: Respiratory failure is common due to bulbar muscle weakness, poor muscle tone, sleep apnea, and restrictive lung defects.
		- Early extubation is preferred but must balance against risks of atelectasis, aspiration, and respiratory failure.
	- **Malignant Hyperthermia**:
		- Historically associated with neuromuscular disorders (e.g., myotonia congenita, DMD, central core myopathies).
		- Differentiation between true malignant hyperthermia and "Anaesthesia Related Rhabdomyolysis" is important.
		- High caution recommended, especially in cases like hypokalaemic periodic paralysis and central core disease.

### Individual Hereditary Disorders

#### Pre-junctional Disorders
**Peripheral Neuropathies**
- **Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease**
	- Hereditary condition causing chronic peripheral neuromuscular denervation.
	- Leads to muscle atrophy, spinal and limb deformities, muscle weakness, and sensory disturbances.
	- Commonly requires orthopedic intervention (e.g., foot deformities like pes cavus).
	- **Anaesthetic Considerations:**
		- Avoid depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.
		- Non-depolarizing agents may have prolonged effects.
		- Anaesthesia can be maintained with intravenous (i.v.) or volatile agents.
		- Respiratory compromise may necessitate postoperative ventilation.
		- Neurological deficits should be documented before regional anaesthesia.
- **Friedrich’s Ataxia**
	- Autosomal recessive ataxia with skeletal muscle weakness and progressive limb ataxia.
	- Often associated with myocardial degeneration, leading to death from myocardial failure.
	- **Anaesthetic Considerations:**
		- Diaphragmatic impairment may result in respiratory failure.
		- Avoid depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.
		- Risk of aspiration due to upper motor neuron involvement.
		- Caution with negatively inotropic drugs due to myocardial involvement.
#### Post-junctional Disorders
**Dystrophies**
- **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**
	- Most common childhood muscular dystrophy (1:3500 live births).
	- X-linked recessive; presents with progressive muscle wasting and weakness, primarily in proximal muscles.
		- Those with the disorder lack dystrophina protein that helps to anchor muscle cells to the extra-cellular matrix.
		- This leads to the absence of dystrophin expressed within the sarcolemma, rendering the sarcolemma weak.
			- Muscle fibres are then inadequately tethered, and these fibres then become replaced with fibrous connective tissue leading to the pseuodhypertrophy seen.
	- Often fatal by late adolescence due to respiratory or cardiac failure.
	- Characterized by:
		- waddling gait
		- pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles
		- scoliosis
		- restrictive lung function
		- cardiomyopathies.
	- **Anaesthetic Considerations:**
		- High risk of postoperative respiratory insufficiency and cardiac dysfunction.
		- Preoperative assessment is crucial, especially before major surgery.
		- Consider postoperative ventilatory support and continuous cardiac monitoring.
		- Increased blood loss risk due to smooth muscle and platelet dysfunction.
		- Avoid hypovolaemia; consider invasive volume status monitoring.
		- Avoid depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents due to the risk of hyperkalaemia and rhabdomyolysis.
		- Non-depolarizing agents should be used sparingly and with neuromuscular monitoring.
		- Inhalation anaesthetics are linked to rhabdomyolysis; total i.v. anaesthesia is preferred.
		- Use clean anaesthetic machines; discontinue inhalation agents promptly if necessary.
		- Female carriers may show elevated CK levels, myopathic changes, and cardiomyopathy, warranting cautious use of anaesthetic agents.
- **Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD)**
	- Similar to Duchenne but milder, with partial absence of dystrophin.
	- Presents in teenage years; death typically occurs in the fourth or fifth decade due to cardiac or respiratory failure.
	- **Anaesthetic Considerations:**
		- Similar to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy with the need for cautious management due to the risks of hyperkalaemia, rhabdomyolysis, and prolonged neuromuscular block.
### Myotonias and Anaesthetic Management

#### Overview
- Myotonias are classified into two groups: dystrophic and non-dystrophic.
	- **Dystrophic Myotonias**: Characterized by muscle wasting and weakness (e.g., Myotonic Dystrophy).
	- **Non-dystrophic Myotonias**: Characterized by prolonged muscle contraction after stimulation (e.g., Myotonia Congenita, Familial Periodic Paralysis).

### Dystrophic Myotonias

**Myotonic Dystrophy**
- **Incidence**: 2.4–5.5 cases per 100,000 in the UK; autosomal dominant disorder.
- **Clinical Features**:
	- Myotonia (incomplete muscle relaxation, e.g., inability to ‘let go’ after a hand grip).
	- Muscle wasting, cardiac abnormalities (conduction defects, cardiomyopathy).
	- Respiratory abnormalities (restrictive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnoea).
	- Endocrine dysfunction and intellectual impairment.
- **Pathophysiology**: Abnormal sodium or chloride channels cause muscle hyperexcitability, leading to repetitive action potentials and sustained contraction.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Avoid factors that precipitate myotonias (e.g., hypothermia, shivering, mechanical/electrical stimulation).
	- Increased sensitivity to sedatives and analgesics; use cautiously.
	- Avoid depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (risk of generalized muscular contractures).
	- Non-depolarizing agents are safe, but anti-cholinesterase drugs may precipitate contractures.
	- Monitor glucose metabolism perioperatively.
	- Bulbar muscle weakness increases aspiration risk; consider conduction defects and ensure pacemaker availability.
### Non-Dystrophic Myotonias

**Myotonia Congenita**
- **Incidence**: 2 per 50,000; autosomal dominant disorder linked to chromosome 17.
- **Clinical Features**:
	- Muscle hypertrophy leading to severe contraction and stiffness upon movement initiation.
	- No muscle weakness but possible palatopharyngeal dysfunction (aspiration risk).
	- Potential cardiomyopathy.
- **Pathophysiology**: Dysfunctional chloride channel reduces chloride conductance, causing muscle hyperexcitability and myotonic contractures.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Avoid depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (risk of intractable myotonias).
	- Avoid cold environments, postoperative shivering, and excessive physical manipulation.
	- Non-depolarizing agents will not relax contractions; regional/peripheral nerve block is ineffective.
	- Sodium channel blockers or topical local anaesthetics may be useful in breaking contractures.

**Hyperkalaemic Periodic Paralysis (HyperPP)**
- **Incidence**: 1 in 100,000; autosomal dominant disorder linked to chromosome 17.
- **Clinical Features**:
	- Episodes of flaccid paralysis associated with increased serum potassium.
	- Precipitated by cold, hunger, and stress; respiratory muscles usually spared.
	- Dysrhythmias may occur.
- **Pathophysiology**: Dysfunctional sodium channel leads to hyperexcitability followed by inactivity and muscle weakness.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Preoperative potassium depletion recommended (use of loop diuretics).
	- Avoid drugs that cause potassium release from cells (e.g., depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents).
	- Avoid potassium-containing fluids; ensure continuous ECG monitoring.
	- Calcium should be available for emergency treatment of hyperkalaemia.
	- Minimize fasting; infuse glucose-containing fluids during fasting periods.
	- Avoid hypothermia; postoperative paralysis may occur but can be managed with good perioperative care.
	- Use of volatile agents and non-depolarizing agents is generally safe.

**Hypokalaemic Periodic Paralysis (HypoPP)**
- **Incidence**: Rare autosomal dominant disorder involving defective calcium channels.
- **Clinical Features**:
	- Severe muscle weakness and asymmetrical paralysis associated with low serum potassium.
	- Often presents in the second decade of life.
- **Pathophysiology**: Mutations in the dihydropyridine receptor gene; some mutations associated with malignant hyperthermia (theoretical risk).
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Potential link to malignant hyperthermia; cautious use of volatile agents.
	- Avoid depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.
	- Use non-depolarizing agents with short duration.
	- Avoid drugs causing serum potassium shifts, maintain normothermia, and monitor potassium levels.
	- Anxiety can precipitate weakness; should be managed carefully.
	- A perioperative attack may require postoperative ventilation; cardiac arrhythmias may occur.
### Metabolic and Mitochondrial Disorders

#### Metabolic Myopathies
- **Overview**:
	- Conditions result from inborn errors of metabolism causing skeletal muscle dysfunction.
	- Can involve abnormalities in glycogen, lipid, purine, or mitochondrial metabolism.
	- ATP production relies on glycogen, lipid, and purine metabolism; interruptions cause muscle cramps, myalgia, myoglobinuria, muscle weakness, and atrophy.
	- Both cardiac and respiratory systems may be affected.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Aggressive metabolic monitoring is required perioperatively.
	- Ensure adequate hydration and forced diuresis to prevent myoglobinuria.
	- Administer glucose and amino acid infusions to support muscle metabolism.
	- Prevent hypothermia to avoid shivering and increased muscle activity.
#### Mitochondrial Myopathies

- **Overview**:
	- Caused by primary mitochondrial dysfunction affecting ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation.
	- High energy-demanding organs, such as skeletal muscle, are particularly vulnerable.
	- Symptoms range from muscle weakness and exercise intolerance to heart failure, movement disorders, and death.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Anaesthetic drugs generally have a depressant effect on mitochondria; careful selection is essential.
	- Risk of total atrio-ventricular block; ensure access to temporary pacemaker in theatre.
	- Stringent glucose control is essential; avoid stress, prolonged fasting, and compound sodium lactate infusions.
	- Respiratory failure and aspiration may occur postoperatively.
	- Low-dose volatile inhalation anaesthetics and ketamine are recommended.
	- Avoid or reduce doses of local anaesthetics and propofol due to mitochondrial depression.

### Acquired Disorders

#### Pre-junctional Disorders
**Motor Neurone Disease**
- **Overview**:
	- Affects upper and/or lower motor neurons, leading to muscle atrophy and extra-junctional acetylcholine receptor development.
	- Signs include upper and lower motor neuron symptoms in limbs and bulbar muscles, fasciculations, weakness, and atrophy.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Avoid depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.
	- Use non-depolarizing agents in reduced doses due to increased sensitivity.
	- High risk of respiratory complications; consider postoperative ventilation, weaning difficulties, infection, and atelectasis.

**Multiple Sclerosis**
- **Overview**:
	- Chronic relapsing demyelinating disorder characterized by plaque formation in the brain and spinal cord.
	- Causes weakness, spasticity, and sensory dysfunction.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Local anaesthetics may exacerbate symptoms; use with caution.
	- Non-depolarizing agents may be used in normal doses.
	- Exercise caution with depolarizing agents in debilitated patients.
	- Maintain normothermia as symptoms can worsen with increased temperature.

**Guillain-Barré Syndrome**
- **Overview**:
	- Immune-mediated polyneuropathy often following a viral/bacterial illness.
	- Characterized by ascending symmetrical weakness, sensory dysfunction, and possible respiratory compromise.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Rapid respiratory muscle weakness may require intubation and ventilation.
	- Use invasive monitoring due to autonomic instability risk.
	- Avoid depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents due to risk of hyperkalaemic cardiac arrest.
	- Increased sensitivity to non-depolarizing agents; consider epidural anaesthesia to reduce opioid use.

**Diabetic Polyneuropathy**
- **Overview**:
	- Can involve sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction.
	- Pathophysiology involves vascular, metabolic, and autoimmune factors.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Autonomic instability may require invasive monitoring.
	- Gastroparesis increases aspiration risk; take care during induction and postoperatively.
	- High risk of hypothermia; maintain temperature control.
#### Neuromuscular Junction Disorders
**Myasthenia Gravis**
- **Overview**:
	- Autoimmune disease with IgG antibodies against nicotinic Ach receptors, leading to receptor destruction.
	- Symptoms include fatigable weakness, which may be localized or widespread.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Resistance to depolarizing agents; may require increased dose.
	- Sensitivity to non-depolarizing agents; only 10% of normal dose needed.
	- Avoid cholinesterase inhibitors and drugs that interfere with neuromuscular transmission.
	- Postoperative ventilation may be necessary.

**Eaton-Lambert Syndrome**
- **Overview**:
	- Immune-related condition often associated with malignancy, with antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels.
	- Weakness improves with exercise; less cranial nerve involvement than myasthenia gravis.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Sensitivity to both depolarizing and non-depolarizing agents.
	- Anticholinesterases can be given; monitor for autonomic dysfunction.
	- Postoperative ventilation may be needed.
#### Post-junctional Disorders
**Critical Illness Polyneuropathy**
- **Overview**:
	- Acquired during critical illness; manifests with muscle weakness, atrophy, failure to wean from ventilator.
	- Caused by axonal degeneration of motor and sensory nerve fibers, with myopathic changes in muscle.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Prevention in ICU is key; no specific treatment available.
	- Avoid prolonged infusions of non-depolarizing agents, especially with high-dose steroids.
	- Avoid depolarizing agents to prevent hyperkalaemic cardiac arrest.

**Critical Illness Myopathy**
- **Overview**:
	- Often occurs with critical illness polyneuropathy; presents with diffuse weakness or flaccid paralysis.
	- Associated with acute respiratory disorder and use of intravenous steroids, non-depolarizing agents, and aminoglycosides.
	- Diagnosis involves clinical exam, electrophysiological studies, and muscle biopsy.
- **Anaesthetic Considerations**:
	- Similar to critical illness polyneuropathy; focus on prevention in ICU.
	- Avoid depolarizing agents due to denervation-related risks.
### Complications in Neuromuscular Disorders (NMD)

#### Rhabdomyolysis
- **Causes**:
	- Triggered by depolarizing muscle relaxants, especially in denervated, dystrophic, and metabolically altered muscles.
	- Extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors cause widespread membrane depolarization, hyperkalaemia, and rhabdomyolysis.
	- Sustained calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, potentiated by volatile anaesthetics, leads to hypermetabolism and muscle cell damage.
	- Myotonias can induce rhabdomyolysis due to sustained muscle contraction.
- **Signs**:
	- Frothy urine, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalaemia, myoglobinuria, CK > 10,000 U/l.
- **Treatment**:
	- Cease causative drugs.
	- Correct hyperkalaemia.
	- Aggressive volume resuscitation (target urine output > 1 ml/kg/hr).
	- Urine alkalinisation with sodium bicarbonate.
	- Monitor liver enzymes, coagulation, blood gases, electrolytes, glucose.
	- Dantrolene may be helpful in cases of hypermetabolism, especially with hyperthermia.
#### Respiratory Complications
- **Causes**:
	- Bulbar muscle involvement leads to aspiration and chronic insufficiency.
	- Respiratory and pharyngeal muscle involvement, higher incidence of OSA.
	- Progressive spinal deformities cause restrictive defects.
- **Management**:
	- Preoperative pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases are essential.
	- Avoid respiratory depressants perioperatively to prevent acute decompensation.
	- Intensive care may be required postoperatively for prolonged intubation and respiratory support.
	- Effective postoperative physiotherapy and CPAP are crucial for low lung volumes, preventing atelectasis and respiratory infection.
#### Cardiac Complications
- **Causes**:
	- Cardiomyopathy and cardiac conduction abnormalities are common, leading to cardiac arrest.
	- Dysfunction is often silent due to limited exercise tolerance.
- **Management**:
	- Echocardiograms are useful, but fluid boluses, vasopressors, and inotropes require careful titration.
	- Awareness of unpredictable responses to perioperative stresses or anaesthetic agents.
#### Autonomic Dysfunction
- **Causes**:
	- Common in NMD, leading to severe hypotension after induction or regional anaesthesia.
	- Gastric stasis increases aspiration risk.
- **Management**:
	- Suspect autonomic impairment and have sympathomimetic drugs available.
	- Expect exaggerated responses to sympathomimetics due to alpha and beta adrenoreceptor sensitization.
#### Myotonic Reactions
- **Causes**:
	- Triggered by repetitive action potentials causing sodium influx or reduced chloride efflux, leading to membrane hyperexcitability.
	- Triggered by suxamethonium, anticholinesterases, opioids, temperature changes, acidosis, shivering, and osmolality changes.
- **Prevention and Management**:
	- Maintain serum potassium at 4.0–4.5 mmol/l; diet high in complex carbohydrates.
	- Thiazides, acetazolamide, and sodium restriction may help in hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis.
	- Treat with drugs that block sodium channels (e.g., mexiletine, tocainide).
	- Masseter spasm in NMD patients should be treated with suspicion for malignant hyperthermia (MH).
#### Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)
- **Risk**:
	- Debate exists regarding the susceptibility of NMD patients to MH.
	- Some myopathies (Evans myopathy, King Denborough syndrome, Central Core Disease) are predisposed to MH.
- **Management**:
	- Monitor closely for muscle injury, metabolism changes, electrolyte disturbances, acidosis, hyperthermia, and myoglobinuria.
	- Low threshold for suspicion of MH in myopathy patients; Dantrolene may be used effectively for hypermetabolism even when not associated with MH.
# Diagnosis and Management of Malignant Hyperthermia

### Definitions
- **Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)**: A progressive, life-threatening hyperthermic reaction occurring during general anaesthesia.
	- Requires a separate identity and specific ICD codes due to differential diagnosis requirements involving cerebral function.
- **MH Susceptibility**: Genetic predisposition to develop MH under anaesthesia.
### Epidemiology of MH
- **Global Occurrence**: MH is well-established in Japan, China, Australia, America, and Europe.
	- Some communities believe MH does not affect their race due to anecdotal evidence (presumed genetic isolation).
- **UK Demographics**:
	- UK is a cosmopolitan country; MH susceptibility is confirmed in individuals from Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
- **Index Case (Proband)**:
	- First patient in a family to have an MH reaction.
	- Audit (1990–2010) at the Leeds MH unit: 62% of probands are male, 38% are female.
- **Testing in Family Members**:
	- Testing is offered to all family members of probands with confirmed MH susceptibility.
	- As of December 2014, 4085 males and 4040 females were tested in Leeds.
	- Incidence of positive tests: 42% in males, 37% in females.
	- Possible reasons for male preponderance:
		- More males require surgery.
		- Higher clinical penetrance of MH in males.
- **Age Distribution**:
	- MH reactions can occur at any age, with a positive skew towards children and young adults.
	- Higher incidence noted after trauma, orthopaedic, and ENT procedures.
- **Referral Statistics**:
	- Leeds National UK MH Unit receives approximately 150 new patient referrals annually.
	- 40-50 patients test susceptible to MH each year.
	- Incidence in the UK: 1:50,000 to 1:70,000.
	- Prevalence estimates range from 1:3,000 to 1:100,000.
- **Previous Uneventful Anaesthetics**:
	- Many patients had uneventful general anaesthetics with triggering agents before an MH reaction.
	- Possible contributing factors: duration of surgery, choice and concentration of volatile anaesthetic agents.
	- Notable cases:
		- UK patient developed MH on 13th exposure.
		- USA patient developed MH on 31st exposure.

![[AD08E84D-8165-4906-8905-7262A17AD362_4_5005_c.jpeg]]

- **Mortality Rates**:
	- UK mortality from MH: 4%.
	- USA mortality from MH: 6-12%, increased over the last 15 years.
	- Possible contributing factors: more ‘office-based’ procedures and the presumption that MH is always treatable.
	- Recent UK fatalities: MH reactions from inhalation agents used for sedation or treatment of status asthmaticus in the ICU.

### Pathophysiology of Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)

![[C40DFBAF-C1FA-43CC-882B-F8E9D3F9CE1D.jpeg]]

- **Skeletal Muscle Contraction**:
	- Action potential generated at motor endplate → Acetylcholine release → Binds to receptor → Action potential spreads across skeletal muscle membrane including T-tubules.
	- Dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR) in T-tubules undergo conformational change in response to action potential.
	- Conformational change in DHPR interacts with calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptor, RyR).
	- Calcium released into cytosol binds to troponin C, enabling actin-myosin cross-bridge formation and muscle contraction.
	- Muscle contraction requires ATP, converting only ~40% of energy into work, with the remainder generating heat.
	- Oxygen utilized, CO2 released during contraction; calcium is actively sequestered out of cytosol using ATP, leading to muscle relaxation.
- **Excitation–Contraction (EC) Coupling**:
	- In MH-susceptible patients, exposure to trigger agents causes dysregulation of EC coupling, leading to sustained calcium release into cytosol.
	- Initial increase in metabolic demand for ATP to sequester calcium → Increased CO2 production and O2 consumption.
	- CO2 rise stimulates sympathetic nervous system, causing reactive heart rate increase.
	- Progressive calcium release exceeds sequestration capacity, causing muscle contraction, accelerated heat production, and muscle rigidity.
	- Initial acid-base disturbance: Respiratory acidosis, progressing to metabolic acidosis with increased lactate when oxygen demand exceeds supply.
	- Sustained contraction perturbs sarcolemmal integrity → Potassium, creatine kinase, and myoglobin release → Hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury.
	- Hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis predispose to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- **Genetic Defects Leading to MH Susceptibility**:
	- Mutations in **RYR1** gene (encoding skeletal muscle isoform of RyR) account for 40–80% of cases.
	- ~1% of cases result from mutations in **CACNA1S** gene (encoding principal subunit of DHPR).
	- Genetic causes of remaining cases are unidentified.
### Clinical Presentation of MH

- **Cardinal Clinical Features**:
	- Rise in end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), unexplained increase in heart rate, rise in core body temperature, and muscle rigidity.
	- Order of onset is consistent, but temporal separation and relative magnitude vary.
	- Known factors affecting variability:
		- Use of succinylcholine (accelerates reaction).
		- Choice of inhalation anaesthetic (potency affects onset and course; e.g., isoflurane > sevoflurane > desflurane).
		- Use of drugs reducing sympathetic heart rate responses (e.g., beta-blockers, remifentanil).
		- Baseline core body temperature.
- **Unchecked MH Reaction**:
	- Leads to progressive hypercapnia, increased heart rate, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, acidosis, hypoxia, and DIC.
	- Combination of hypercarbia, sympathetic stimulation, hyperkalemia, and acidosis is highly arrhythmogenic, risking cardiac arrest unless corrected.
	- Irreversible stage involves histotoxic hypoxia (mitochondrial failure) and stagnant hypoxia (muscle ischemia from swollen necrotic muscles increasing intra-compartmental pressures).
- **Other Clinical Features in MH-Susceptible Patients**:
	- Exaggerated response to succinylcholine may cause prolonged jaw muscle rigidity (masseter muscle spasm), generalized muscle rigidity, and/or rhabdomyolysis.
	- Rare cases: Succinylcholine-induced acute hyperkalemic cardiac arrest.
	- Common scenario: Rhabdomyolysis presenting postoperatively as myoglobinuria and acute kidney injury.
- **Classification of MH Presentations (Leeds MH Unit, 45-Year Period)**:
	1. **Classical/Fulminant/Severe Features of MH**: Marked metabolic hyperactivity and muscle breakdown; life-threatening, requiring active MH treatment.
	2. **Moderate Features of MH**: Metabolic hyperactivity and muscle breakdown consistent with MH; reaction terminated before becoming life-threatening.
	3. **Mild Features of MH**: One or more metabolic signs of MH without full development.
	4. **Masseter Muscle Spasm as Sole Feature**.
	5. **Masseter Spasm with Rhabdomyolysis**.
	6. **Masseter Spasm with Metabolic Disturbance**.
	7. **Unexplained Perioperative Death or Cardiac Arrest**: Historically, 2/3 of such cases were related to MH.
	8. **Other Presentations**:
		- Postoperative pyrexia and rhabdomyolysis.
		- MH can be diagnosed up to 40 minutes after discontinuation of the inhalation anaesthetic trigger.
		- Pyrexia alone is not indicative of MH as it is always preceded by metabolic stimulation.
		- MH can be excluded if pyrexia occurred in the surgical ward rather than the postoperative care unit.

	- tourniquet ischaemia
	- thyroid storm
- Patient related:
	- phaeochromocytoma
	- neuromuscular disorders
	- preexisting infection/sepsis  
- Idiosyncratic:
	- anaphylaxis
	- serotonin syndrome
	- neuroleptic malignant syndrome
### Clinical Management of Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)
- **Early Diagnosis**:
	- Essential for reducing mortality and morbidity.
	- Summon as much help as possible; involve surgeon and scrub staff if necessary.
#### Immediate Management

1. **Anaesthesia**:
	- Stop volatile anaesthetic agents, remove vaporizer, hyperventilate with 100% oxygen.
	- If available, use activated charcoal filters on inspiratory and expiratory ports.
	- If no filters:
		- Manual hyperventilation using a non-rebreathing circuit while removing volatile agent from the machine.
		- Otherwise, hyperventilate with 100% oxygen at 15 L/min, change breathing circuits and soda lime when skilled help arrives.
	- Maintain anaesthesia with intravenous agents.
2. **Dantrolene**:
	- Acts on EC coupling to reduce calcium accumulation in muscle cells.
	- Starting dose: 2.5 mg/kg.
	- Prepare each 20 mg vial with 60 mL water for injection; time-consuming process, assign someone to continuously prepare the drug.
	- Further doses of 1 mg/kg every 5 min until metabolic signs resolve (e.g., ETCO2 < 6 kPa, core temperature < 38.5°C).
	- Recrudescence possible for up to 14 hours; no upper dose limit in acute MH context.
	- Ensure adequate dantrolene supply through an action plan with pharmacy.
3. **Hyperthermia**:
	- Turn off active warming devices.
	- Cooling measures proportionate to core temperature; aggressive cooling if >39°C, stop when <38.5°C.
	- Consider moderate hypothermia (34.5°C) if patient unresponsive to dantrolene.
4. **Monitoring and Sampling**:
	- Continue routine monitoring (SaO2, ECG, NIBP, ETCO2).
	- Establish additional IV access, insert central venous catheter and arterial line.
	- Collect blood samples (K+, creatine kinase, ABG, glucose, renal/hepatic function, coagulation).
	- Insert bladder catheter for urine output measurement.
5. **Hyperkalemia**:
	- **Insulin**: 10 IU in 50 mL 50% dextrose over 5 min (or 50 IU insulin as per European MH Group guidelinemay lead to hypoglycaemia).
	- **Calcium Chloride**: 0.1 mmol/kg IV for life-threatening hyperkalemia.
	- **Haemofiltration** may be needed if massive rhabdomyolysis is present.
6. **Acidosis**:
	- Correct respiratory acidosis with hyperventilation.
	- Administer sodium bicarbonate IV if pH < 7.2.
7. **Arrhythmias**:
	- Use **Amiodarone** (5 mg/kg) or beta-blockers (e.g., esmolol, metoprolol) for tachycardia.
	- Manage cardiac arrest per Also guidelines.
	- Avoid calcium channel blockers due to risk of severe myocardial depression with dantrolene.
8. **Acute Kidney Injury**:
	- Maintain diuresis of 2 mL/kg/h with IV fluids; dantrolene contains mannitol aiding urine output.
	- Use furosemide (0.5–1 mg/kg) if diuresis is inadequate.
	- Alkalinize urine to reduce myoglobin precipitation and lipid peroxidation.
	- Paracetamol may reduce renal injury by decreasing lipid peroxidation.
9. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)**:
	- Treat as consumptive coagulopathy; administer platelets and clotting factors.
	- Correct hyperthermia to control coagulopathy.
10. **Post-Reaction Monitoring**:
	- Monitor for a minimum of 24 hours in a critical care environment.
	- Observe for acute kidney injury, compartment syndrome, and recrudescence of hypermetabolic condition.
### Patient Counselling and Referral

- **Confirm or Refute Diagnosis**:
	- If MH is suspected, confirm or refute the diagnosis.
	- Inform the patient that they and their blood relatives are at risk of MH under anaesthesia until proven otherwise.
- **Referral Responsibility**:
	- The proband’s consultant anaesthetist must refer the patient to a specialist MH centre.
	- UK centre contact: authors’ address.
	- Other centres (excluding North America and Japan): [www.emhg.org](http://www.emhg.org) (accessed 4 January 2017).
	- North American centres: www.mhaus.org/testing/centers (accessed 4 January 2017).
- **Referral Details**:
	- Provide a narrative account of the reaction, preoperative assessment notes, anaesthetic charts, postoperative care records, and all investigation results (e.g., CK concentrations, ABGs, electrolytes, LFTs).
	- Include the patient's general practitioner's details.
- **Post-Referral Process**:
	- The MH centre decides on the need for further testing.
	- The final decision is communicated to the referring anaesthetist, general practitioner, and patient.
### Confirmation of Diagnosis

- **Guidelines**:
	- The European MH Group published updated guidelines for diagnosing MH susceptibility in 2015.
- **In Vitro Contracture Testing (IVCT)**:
	- IVCT using muscle biopsy is the definitive test to confirm MH susceptibility.
	- DNA screening has a 40% sensitivity for confirming MH susceptibility, potentially avoiding the need for muscle biopsy in some cases.
### Muscle Biopsy for IVCT

- **Procedure**:
	- IVCT performed at specialist centres for quality control.
	- Patients travel to the centre; fresh muscle biopsy from the vastus muscle (20–30  3–5  2–3 mm) is required.
	- Muscle specimens are exposed to halothane or caffeine; MH-susceptible muscle shows contracture at lower concentrations.
	- Patients are informed of IVCT results on the same day.
- **Additional Tests**:
	- Additional muscle specimens sent for histopathology to exclude underlying muscle diseases or core myopathy.
	- Core myopathy may indicate MH susceptibility and could benefit from neurological referral and genetic counselling.
	- IVCT is not performed on children under 10 years or those weighing less than 30 kg in the UK.

### Genetic Testing for MH

- **Genetic Complexity**:
	- MH genetics are more complex than initially thought, involving multiple genes (RYR1, CACNA1S, and others) and variants.
	- Some families may have more than one genetic variant contributing to MH susceptibility.
	- Genetic testing cannot exclude MH susceptibility but can provide important information about MH risk.

# Anesthesia-induced Rhabdomyolysis or Malignant Hyperthermia: is Defining the Crisis Important?

### Introduction

- **History of Rhabdomyolysis and Anesthesia**:
	- Rhabdomyolysis following exposure to suxamethonium and/or halogenated volatile anesthetic agents has been documented since the 1960s.
	- The term "anesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis" (AIR) was first used in 1978 for a dystrophic patient who developed rhabdomyolysis after suxamethonium and halothane exposure.
	- Initially thought to be an aberrant form of malignant hyperthermia (MH), AIR was recognized as a distinct clinical entity in 1992, associated primarily with myopathies like Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
- **Incidence and Diagnosis**:
	- MH occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 anesthetics; the incidence of AIR is unknown due to a lack of wide-reaching data collection.
	- Many AIR cases go unrecognized, misdiagnosed as MH, or result in unexplained deaths.
	- Accurate diagnosis is critical as timely and appropriate management can be life-saving, while delays can be fatal.
### Diagnosis

- **Catastrophic Presentation**:
	- The most severe presentation of AIR is sudden cardiac arrest, occurring intraoperatively or postoperatively as the child wakes up.
	- Markedly elevated potassium levels (two to three times normal) are typically observed.
- **Other Presentations**:
	- Postoperative rhabdomyolysis (e.g., cola-colored urine) without cardiac arrest.
	- Gradual increase in temperature and heart rate without hypermetabolism or muscle rigidity.
- **Cause and Risk Factors**:
	- AIR results from exposure to suxamethonium or halogenated agents.
	- Specific proteins within the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, which are abnormal in dystrophies and certain myopathies, are implicated.
	- Children with these disorders are at increased risk, though the reaction is idiosyncratic and does not occur in every patient or with every exposure.
	- Further research is needed to identify conditions under which AIR occurs, potentially involving factors like dose of anesthetic, patient’s age, recent infection, or specific genotypes.
### Differentiating AIR from MH

- **Clinical Differences**:
	- AIR presents as acute rhabdomyolysis; MH presents as hypermetabolism progressing to rhabdomyolysis if unmanaged.
	- In AIR, electrocardiographic abnormalities appear first, with normal oxygen saturations until peri-arrest.
	- In MH, oxygen saturation drops and EtCO2 rises early due to hypermetabolism.
- **Management Differences**:
	- **Dantrolene**: Effective in MH but not in AIR.
	- Proper differentiation is crucial, as AIR management focuses on maintaining cardiac output and reducing serum potassium, rather than administering dantrolene.
- **Associated Muscle Disorders**:
	- Certain muscle disorders have a known predisposition to MH, as detailed in a previous editorial.

### Treatment of Anesthesia-Induced Rhabdomyolysis (AIR)

1. **Call for Help**: Immediately summon assistance.
2. **Discontinue Triggering Agents**: Stop halogenated anesthetic agents and/or suxamethonium.
3. **Oxygenation**:
	- Hyperventilate with 100% oxygen at ≥10 L/min to flush the halogenated agent from the lungs.
4. **Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)**:
	- Start CPR if the patient is pulseless or heart rate is <60.
5. **Intubation and Ventilation**:
	- Intubate and ventilate if not already done.
6. **Address Hyperkalemia**:
	- Administer calcium (calcium gluconate 50 mg/kg or calcium chloride 20 mg/kg) to stabilize cardiac membranes.
7. **Anesthetic Machine Adjustment**:
	- Switch to an anesthetic machine prepared for patients sensitive to halogenated agents, or use oxygen from an uncontaminated source (e.g., wall outlet, ICU ventilator).
8. **Surgical Considerations**:
	- Stop surgery if possible; if surgery must continue, use a non-triggering anesthetic (e.g., ketamine, propofol) once spontaneous circulation is restored.
9. **Blood Sampling**:
	- Take a venous or arterial blood sample to measure potassium, creatine kinase, and myoglobin.
10. **Hyperkalemia Treatment**:
	- Treat hyperkalemia as per protocol, prioritizing membrane stabilization.
11. **Urinary Monitoring**:
	- Insert a urinary catheter, send urine for myoglobin analysis, and monitor urine output.
12. **Fluid Management**:
	- Administer fluids (5 mL/kg boluses of 0.9% NaCl) to maintain urine output >1 mL/kg/h.
	- Give mannitol (0.25 g/kg) to prevent myoglobin-induced renal damage.
13. **Inotropic Support**:
	- Use inotropes early; epinephrine is preferred.
14. **Monitor for Renal Failure**:
	- Monitor urine output; if it decreases despite fluids and mannitol, consider urgent hemodialysis to lower potassium.
15. **Advanced Interventions**:
	- If CPR exceeds 10 minutes, consider cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
16. **Continuous Monitoring**:
	- Continue monitoring and treating potassium levels until they stabilize within normal limits.
	- Maintain advanced cardiac life support until potassium is normalized.
	- Prolonged CPR can still result in a good neurological outcome with effective management.

### Avoiding Anesthesia-Induced Rhabdomyolysis (AIR)

- **Anesthetic Technique**:
	- Use total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) for patients known or suspected to have muscular dystrophy.
	- Administer preoperative anxiolysis if needed and apply topical anesthesia (e.g., EMLA) at least 60 minutes before cannulation.
- **Medication Avoidance**:
	- Avoid suxamethonium in patients with known or suspected muscle disease.
	- Sugammadex has been used uneventfully in some muscle disorder cases, but insufficient evidence exists to recommend it broadly.
- **Anesthetic Machine Preparation**:
	- Flush the anesthetic machine according to the manufacturer's guidelines to eliminate traces of halogenated agents.
- **Preoperative Assessment**:
	- Be vigilant for potential muscle disorders, especially in asymptomatic children.
	- Investigate family history of anesthesia reactions or muscle disease, and assess motor development for delays or regression.
	- Look for signs of muscle disease during examination: resting tachycardia, enlarged calf muscles, muscle wasting, waddling gait, or poor muscle tone.
- **Anesthetic Considerations**:
	- For patients with potential muscle disorders, strongly consider an anesthetic free of halogenated agents and suxamethonium.
	- **Exception**: In cases of suspected mitochondrial disease (indicated by increased resting blood lactates and multiple organ involvement), avoid propofol infusions.
