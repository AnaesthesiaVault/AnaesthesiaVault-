# Preop Visit

## General
- Use this time to develop rapport and trust with the child and parent.
- Address the child first and then include the parents in discussion.
- Address the queries and fears of the child as well as those of the parent.
- Explain the planned approach to induction so both parent and child know what to expect.
## History and Examination
### History
- Any previous problems with anaesthetics including family history
- Allergies Previous medical problems including congenital anomalies
- Recent respiratory illness
- Current medications
- Recent immunisations
- Fasting times
- Presence of loose teeth.
- Discuss post-operative pain management. If suppository medications are to be used, consent should be obtained from the parent and the child if they are able to understand
### Examination
- Conduct a physical examination as appropriate concentrating on the airway and cardiorespiratory systems
- Children must be weighed. All drug doses relate to body weight. Weight (kg) can be estimated by: (age + 4) x 2. This is less accurate over 10 years.
### Investigations
- Haemoglobin: large expected blood loss, premature infants, systemic disease, congenital heart disease
- Electrolytes: renal or metabolic disease, intravenous fluids, dehydration
- CXR–active respiratory disease, scoliosis, congenital heart disease
### Fasting
- 6 hours for solids and milk if greater than 12 months of age
- 4 hours for breast milk and formula feeds if less than 12 months of age
- 2 hours for unlimited clear fluids (as this decreases gastric acidity and volume)
- There is an increased incidence of nausea and vomiting with long fasting periods.
### Premedication
- Paracetamol, ibuprofen or codeine phosphate given more than a half hour pre-operatively.
- EMLA or amethocaine cream is applied to identifiable veins on those children for whom an intravenous induction is planned
- Midazolam 0.5 mg/kg with a maximum of 15 mg given orally 15-30 minutes preoperatively. It has a variable result and can produce a very unpleasant excitatory phase. Timing is important for best effect. A sweetener may be necessary.
- Ketamine 3-8 mg/kg orally 30-60 minutes pre-operatively

# Approach to Anaesthesia

## Induction
- Inhalational induction can be an excellent technique (Sevo)
- OPA may be used. Choose one that is the same length as that from the corner of the mouth to the angle of the jaw
- Induction is moderately slow but the rate is increased with the addition of 50-65% nitrous oxide
- A concentration of 8% Sevo can be used initially or it can be wound up gradually.
- Nitrous oxide use increases the rate and depth of anaesthesia obtained. It has improved haemodynamic stability. MAC values are 3.3 in infants, 2.5 in children and 1.7 in adults. Use is associated with emergence delirium
- The best sites for intravenous access are: Back of the hand Inner wrist Long saphenous vein Other veins on the dorsum of the foot Cubital fossa veins are difficult to find in infants and tissue easily at this site Elastoplast, although not sterile, provides a secure means of fixation.
- Intravenous induction can be undertaken with propofol, thiopentone or ketamine. Preoxygenation for a rapid sequence induction can be difficult in small children and should be undertaken if able
## Intubation
- Straight Magill blades are useful in neonates and infants. A size 0 blade is best in babies less than 4 kg. A curved blade is usually easier once the child is 6-10 kg.
- Uncuffed tubes are used until 8-10 years of age. A small leak should be present. The leak is too large if it compromises ventilation.
- Tube size = age/4 + 4.5 is generally a better fit than age/4 + 4 up to 10 years
- Tube length in cm = age/2 +12 (or ID x 3 for an oral ETT and add 2cm for a nasal tube is easier to remember). This is only a guide and the tube length will always need to be checked clinically.
- 1 LMA up to 5 kg; 1.5 LMA 5-10 kg; 2 LMA 10-20 kg; LMA 2.5 20–30 kg; LMA 3 for over 30 kg
- Preformed RAE tubes may be too long. Secure the endotracheal tube with 1cm wide elastoplast, ensuring that the tape wraps about the tube and at least one tape is fixed to the less mobile maxilla. Re-check tube length at the time of taping
## Maintenance
- Add regional analgesia where necessary
- Beware intravenous narcotics in infancy especially ex-premature infants and neonates.
- Use intravenous fluids for cases with expected blood loss, intra-abdominal, or those taking longer than 30 minutes.
- Extubation laryngospasm tends to occur less frequently if the child is fully awake at the time of extubation.
- You may need to be with a child in recovery until fully awake if the recovery staff are inexperienced with children.
