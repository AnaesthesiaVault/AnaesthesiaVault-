# Paediatric Vascular Access

## Introduction

- **Challenges in Obtaining Vascular Access:**
	- Small, mobile veins and excess subcutaneous fat make visualization and palpation difficult.
	- Less cooperation from paediatric patients and potential psychological trauma, especially with repeated procedures in conscious patients.
- **Indications for Vascular Access:**
	- **Short-term use**: i.v. fluids, medications, blood product administration.
	- **Long-term use**: repeated medication (e.g., enzyme replacement, chemotherapy), immunotherapy, total parenteral nutrition, extracorporeal procedures (plasmapheresis, haemodialysis), repeated blood sampling, invasive haemodynamic monitoring.
- **Factors Influencing Device Choice:**
	- Condition and preferences of patient/guardian.
	- Likely duration and frequency of treatment.
	- Properties of the infusate:
		- Vesicants (e.g., calcium solutions, amphotericin B), hypertonic solutions, pH <5 or >9 → Central venous access.
		- Vasopressors and inotropes → Preferably administered centrally to prevent tissue necrosis from extravasation.
- **Prospective Vascular Access Planning:**
	- Poor planning can interrupt therapy, exhaust peripheral vasculature, and cause psychological trauma.
	- For children potentially needing haemodialysis, preserve upper extremity/subclavian veins by using internal jugular or femoral veins for central venous access.
### Aspects of Peripheral Cannulation

- **Skin Preparation:**
	- **Concerns in infants**: Alcoholic chlorhexidine can cause skin damage and systemic absorption.
	- **ChloraPrep®** (2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol) not licensed for use in children <2 months.
	- Use **70% isopropyl alcohol wipes** for cannulation in children <2 months; **chlorhexidine acetate 0.5%** for central access.
- **Visualization of Veins:**
	- Use of **tourniquet**, **gentle tapping**, and **local warming** can enhance vein visibility in children.
	- Devices like **transillumination** and **near-infrared light devices** help visualize veins by detecting haemoglobin and projecting an image.
	- **Ultrasound** guidance for vascular cannulation in children is well-established.

- **Pain and Distress Reduction:**
	- **EMLA cream** (2.5% lidocaine + 2.5% prilocaine): Apply with occlusive dressing for at least 1 hour; not recommended for preterm infants or those <12 months receiving methaemoglobin-inducing drugs.
	- **Tetracaine gel (Ametop®)**: Apply with occlusive dressing for 45 minutes; lasts 4-6 hours; avoid use in infants <44 weeks post-gestation.
	- **Vapo-coolant sprays** (e.g., ethyl chloride, fluorohydrocarbons): Provide immediate, short-lasting analgesia by cooling skin; lasts <60 seconds.
	- **Other anaesthetic options**:
		- **Liposomal lidocaine cream**.
		- **Lidocaine-tetracaine self-heating patch**.
		- **Needle-free systems** (e.g., J-Tip) use compressed gas for lidocaine injection.
	- **Non-pharmacological methods**:
		- **Breastfeeding** and **oral sucrose solutions** reduce distress in babies.
		- **Play-specialist preparation** and **distraction** reduce anxiety in older children.
### Sites for Peripheral Cannulation in Children

- Common sites: hands, wrists, feet, antecubital fossae, scalp (babies).
	- Scalp cannulation can cause stabilization issues and increased risk of extravasation.
- Risk of inadvertent arterial cannulation increased in antecubital fossa.
- Long saphenous vein: palpable anterior to medial malleolus.
- Unusual sites: external jugular, abdominal, axillary veins.
- Cannula sizes: as small as 26G.
- Controversy over safety cannulae use in children; resisted due to difficulty and potential harm/distress.
### Central Venous Access

- **Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC):**
	- Available in single-, double-, triple-lumen; size 28G (premature neonates) to 7 Fr.
	- Size depends on access vein and therapy required.
	- Smaller catheters have fewer complications but may block easily.
	- At least 3 Fr needed for blood sampling.
	- Typically used for <2 months, rarely >6 months.
	- Power-injectable PICCs can withstand high pressures (e.g., for CT contrast).
	- Preferred insertion site: basilic vein (above elbow); cephalic vein prone to vasospasm.
	- Other options: brachial vein (with care), long saphenous vein (non-ambulant children).
	- Tip location: distal third of superior vena cava or cavo-atrial junction.
	- Tip position confirmed via fluoroscopy or X-ray; ultrasound to rule out malposition.
	- Upper limb PICCs move with arm movement; fix line in comfortable arm position.
	- Catheter malposition more common in children aged 1–5.
	- Advantages: PICCs can be inserted/removed without general anaesthetic in some cases, lowest complication rate among central venous access devices.
	- Midline catheter: shorter than PICC; tip lies in larger vein segment; dwell time 6–10 days.

![[6117BE3D-28FB-423D-A7EE-C154FA242748.jpeg]]

- **Umbilical Vein Catheter:**
	- Sizes 2.5–8 Fr, singleor double-lumen.
	- Used within the first 7–10 days of life; terminates in inferior vena cava above diaphragm.
	- Avoid in neonates with abdominal wall defects, peritonitis, or necrotizing enterocolitis.
- **Short-term Central Venous Catheters:**
	- Indicated for therapy <7 days or urgent access.
	- Up to five lumens; power-injectable devices available.
	- Common sites and techniques similar to adults, but higher risk of complications in children.
	- Ultrasound guidance recommended.
	- Size determined by vein and therapy:
		- 4–5 Fr for infants <6 months, 5 Fr for ages 6 months to 5 years, 7 Fr for >5 years.
	- Catheter insertion length:
		- Internal jugular: 5 cm for <15 kg, 8 cm for 16–40 kg, 13 cm for >40 kg.
		- Femoral insertion: consider child's body habitus (short lines may cause extravasation in obese/oedematous children).
	- Radiography needed to confirm adequate line tip position.
### Tunnelled and Cuffed Devices

- **External Catheters:**
	- Inserted via central vein using open surgical cut-down or percutaneous Seldinger technique.
	- Catheter is tunnelled to a skin exit site chosen for comfort and safety.
	- Dacron® cuff in the tunnel promotes tissue growth, stabilizing the line and preventing microorganism ingress.
	- Common types: **Broviac®** (smaller) and **Hickman®** (larger, available in single-, double-, and triple-lumen).
	- Wide-bore lines needed for haemodialysis and plasmapheresis.
	- Preferred over PICC lines for therapy >6–8 weeks.
- **Implantable Vascular Access Devices (Ports):**
	- Tunnelled central line connected to an internal titanium/plastic reservoir in a subcutaneous pocket.
	- Entire system is internal, allowing bathing, swimming, less maintenance, and fewer body-image concerns.
	- Accessed using a special non-coring needle; painful but mitigated with local anaesthetic cream.
	- Best for children needing intermittent long-term access (e.g., cystic fibrosis, chemotherapy).
	- Dual-lumen ports available but challenging to manage (both lumens must be flushed with heparin after use).
	- Removal of cuffed catheters/ports requires surgery, usually under general anaesthesia in children.

### Tip Position of Centrally Placed Catheters
- Ideal tip position similar to that for PICC lines (distal third of superior vena cava or cavo-atrial junction).
- High-flow catheters (e.g., for haemodialysis) may have tips in the **right atrium** for optimal function.
- Long-term ported catheters may be placed with an initial right atrial tip position to account for growth.

### Alternative Venous Access Strategies
- Children with multiple venous access devices may develop poor peripheral access and **central vein occlusion/stenosis** (suggested by prominent superficial veins or disproportionate vein size on ultrasound).
- Evaluation with **Doppler ultrasound**, **magnetic resonance angiography**, or **contrast venography** guides further placement.
- **Interventional radiology** options:
	- Recanalization, balloon dilatation, stenting of occluded/stenosed vessels.
- **Alternative approaches**:
	- Inferior vena cava catheterization via translumbar, transhepatic, or direct suprarenal approaches.
	- Non-standard vessels for catheterization: hepatic, azygous veins, or direct intra-atrial catheterization.

### Perioperative Use of Long-Term Venous Access Devices

- **Catheter Handling**: Strict aseptic non-touch technique required.
- **Before Use**: Aspirate to remove any heparin lock.
- **Syringe Use**: Use 10 ml or larger syringes to avoid catheter rupture from high pressure, but avoid large volume injection in neonates.
- **Groshong® Valves**: Tunnelled, non-tunnelled, and PICCs with Groshong® valves don’t need a heparin lock but may cause intermittent boluses of drugs at low infusion rates (e.g., vasopressors).
- **Emergency Port Access**: Can use standard small-bore needles, but this damages the port's silicone membrane.
### Arterial Access

- **Indications/Techniques**: Similar to adults, umbilical artery can be cannulated in newborns.
- **Smaller Cannulas**: 24–22 G for infants, 22–20 G for children; non-ported cannula-over-needle devices are common.
- **Guidewires**: Babywires (0.012 in) are needed for needles <22 G.
- **Ultrasound Guidance**: Real-time Doppler ultrasound can aid difficult insertions.
- **Paediatric Transducer Sets**: Syringe driver used to limit fluid infusion to 1–2 ml/h and minimize flush volume in children <7 kg or <30 kg.
- **Arterial Line Monitoring**: Low-volume tubing and closed sampling systems prevent contamination and blood wastage.

### Intraosseous (IO) Access
- **Rapid Access**: Direct access to central circulation when i.v. access fails within 90 seconds.
- **Common Sites**: Proximal tibia (anteromedial) in children; distal tibia in older children; alternative sites: proximal humerus, distal femur.
- **Needles**: Manual IO needles are 18–14 G and 3–4 cm long; power-driven devices (e.g., BIG, EZ-IO®) are available for children and adults.
- **Insertion Technique**: Ensure the 5 mm depth marking on the needle is visible after insertion; use appropriate needle length based on subcutaneous tissue depth.
- **Complications**: Contraindications include previous attempts within 24 hours, fractures, local infection, bone diseases (e.g., osteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfecta).
- **Drug/Fluid Administration**: All i.v. drugs/fluids can be infused IO but require pressure to overcome resistance of marrow cavity. Monitor for extravasation, especially when using vasopressors.
- **Removal**: IO needle should be removed as soon as alternative i.v. access is established.
