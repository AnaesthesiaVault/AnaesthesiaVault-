# Optimal Ventilation of the Anaesthetised Paediatric Patient

## Introduction

- **Precision in Pediatric Care**:
	- Small errors in interventions can cause injury or inadequate effect.
	- 10% dosage error if weight off by 1 kg in a 10-kg patient.
	- Mechanical ventilation challenges: small changes in tidal volume can lead to hyperventilation, hypoventilation, or lung injury.
- **Advances in Anesthesia Ventilators**:
	- Modern ventilators better suited for pediatric patients, especially smallest children and premature infants.
	- Importance of accurate tidal volume delivery for lung-protective ventilation strategies.
	- Use of bedside monitoring tools to optimize ventilation.
- **Historical Perspective**:
	- **1963 Study (Bendixen et al.)**:
		- Found large tidal volumes protect against falls in oxygen tension.
		- Basis for using larger-than-normal tidal volumes (10-12 mL/kg) for 40 years.
	- Pediatric anesthesiologists struggled with achieving volume targets due to circuit compliance and fresh gas flow influences.
	- Adjusted ventilators by chest excursion observation or manual assessment.
- **Pressure-Controlled Ventilation (PCV)**:
	- Adopted due to difficulty in delivering small tidal volumes accurately with traditional ventilators.
	- Advantages: not affected by circuit compliance, fresh gas flow changes, or small leaks around uncuffed tubes.
	- Disadvantages: Tidal volume consistency not guaranteed; changes in lung-thorax compliance affect volume.
	- Fluctuations significant in small patients, especially during abdominal or thoracic surgeries.
- **Current Technology**:
	- Better suited for accurate small volume delivery.
	- Supports patients with significant comorbidities undergoing complex procedures.
## Modern Anaesthesia Ventilator

- **Functionality**:
	- Supports mechanical ventilation and anesthetic drug delivery.
	- Improved accuracy and precision of volume delivery.
	- Reproduces ICU-type ventilator functionality.
- **Challenges**:
	- Compliance of the breathing system which influences tidal volume being delivered.
	- Interaction between fresh gas flow and tidal volume.
- **Technological Solutions**:
	- **Compliance Compensation**:
		- Pre-use leak and compliance test measures system compliance.
		- Adjusts delivered volume to compensate for system compliance losses.
	- **Fresh Gas Flow Independence**:
		- Some ventilators use valves to prevent fresh gas during inspiration.
		- Others use flow sensors to adjust volume delivery.
	- Modern ventilators are designed to ensure accurate volume delivery, even at smaller volumes.
- **Types of Ventilators**:
	- Pneumatically powered (bellows designs, volume reflector).
	- Electrically powered (piston, turbine).
- **Compliance Calculation Example**:
	- System compliance: 5 mL/cm H2O.
	- Inspiratory pressure: 20 cm H2O.
	- 100 mL volume loss (significant for smaller patients).
- **Pre-use Test Importance**:
	- Must be done each time the circuit is changed/altered.
	- Circuit configuration should match the procedure setup.
	- Alterations post-test affect volume delivery accuracy.
	- Set pressure limits to prevent injury from excessive volumes.
- **Small Tidal Volume Delivery**:
	- Major improvement for pediatric anesthesiologists.
	- Essential for preventing ventilator-induced lung injury.
	- Modern ventilators have minimal tidal volume specifications (~20 mL).
## Lung-Protective Ventilation and the Pediatric Surgical Patient

- **Concept**:
	- Uses PEEP to prevent atelectasis.
	- Limits tidal volume to avoid lung overdistention.
- **Evidence from Adults**:
	- ARDS patients benefit from low tidal volumes (6 mL/kg) over traditional volumes (12 mL/kg).
	- Lower tidal volumes improve mortality and reduce ventilation days.
	- Similar benefits seen in high-risk adult surgical patients (e.g., abdominal surgery).
- **Neonatal Insights**:
	- Preventing lung injury in premature infants.
	- Volume-targeted ventilation reduces bronchopulmonary dysplasia and death.
	- Use PEEP and restrict tidal volume for lung protection.
- **Application to Pediatrics**:
	- Implementing adult and neonatal lung-protective strategies.
	- Target tidal volume: 6-7 mL/kg of predicted body weight.
	- Use PEEP and recruitment maneuvers to prevent/reverse atelectasis.
- **Modern Anesthesia Ventilators**:
	- Provide accurate small tidal volumes.
	- Support various ventilation modes (pressure, volume-controlled, hybrid).
- **Ventilation Modes**:
	- **PCV (Pressure-Controlled Ventilation)**:
		- Delivers constant pressure; independent of circuit compliance and fresh gas flow.
		- Pros: Maximizes lung recruitment, compensates for small leaks, limits inspiratory pressure.
		- Cons: No volume guarantee; changes in compliance affect tidal volume.
		- ![[0CA624B5-00CD-4ED7-A807-396D3AF5D9E5 4.jpeg]]
	- **VCV (Volume-Controlled Ventilation)**:
		- Delivers set tidal volume; flow is constant, pressure varies with compliance.
		- Pros: Guaranteed volume delivery.
		- Cons: Risk of barotrauma, requires pressure limit setting.
	![[CF821E4E-7FAB-440B-BAEE-CFEDF798DEDD 1.jpeg]]
	- **Best-of-Both Ventilation**:
		- Combines benefits of PCV and VCV.
		- Adjusts pressure to achieve set tidal volume based on breath-to-breath compliance measurement.
		- Terminology varies (e.g., PCV-VG, Autoflow, PRVC).
		- Pros: Ensures constant tidal volume, maximizes inspiratory pressure.
		- Cons: Initial fluctuations with compliance changes.
- **Considerations for Small Patients**:
	- Accurate tidal volume delivery critical due to small target volumes.
	- Avoid leaks around uncuffed endotracheal tubes; use cuffed tubes when possible.
	- Compliance compensation and PEEP are vital for lung-protective ventilation.
- **Recommendations**:
	- Use VCV or best-of-both-ventilation with compliance compensation and PEEP for lung-protective strategy.
	- Monitor delivered volumes closely, especially with PCV or in presence of leaks.
	- Adapt ventilation strategy based on patient's specific needs and ventilator capabilities.
**Supported Modes of Ventilation**

- **Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)**:
	- Supports spontaneous ventilation alone or with controlled modes.
	- Benefits:
		- Improves gas exchange
		- facilitates emergence
		- supports hemodynamics: less positive pressure needed, improved venous return
		- assess depth of anesthesia: RR changes to surgical stimulus
		- Use to titrate opioid analgesia
	- Suitable for all patient sizes, including infants.
	- Important to adjust trigger settings to prevent auto-triggering in small infants.
	- Backup rate ensures spontaneous efforts are effective.
- **Optimal PEEP**:
	- Prevents atelectasis; generally set to 5 cm H2O.
	- Higher PEEP levels (>10 cm H2O) may be needed for RDS patients.
	- Tailor PEEP based on oxygenation assessment (PaO2/FiO2 ratio, A-a gradient).
	- Avoid PEEP in cases of:
		- intracranial hypertension
		- hypovolemia
		- bronchopleural fistula.
- **Dead Space in Pediatric Patients**:
	- Minimize apparatus dead space (e.g., elbow connector, HME).
	- Dead space increases PaCO2 and end-tidal CO2 gradient.
	- Use compact HMEs and ensure accurate tidal volume delivery by considering dead space.
	- If a circuit heater/humidifier is used, place in line with inspiratory limbdoes not add to dead-space
![[B80ABB17-BE23-4238-8016-0275774EB490.jpeg]]
- **Monitoring for Optimal Ventilation**:
	- **Goal 1: Arterial Oxygen Tension (PaO2) at Lowest FiO2**:
		- Use pulse oximeter (SpO2) if arterial blood gas analysis is unavailable.
		- Limit or periodically reduce FiO2 to reveal A-a gradient.
		- Adjust tidal volume, PEEP, and use recruitment maneuvers to improve oxygenation.
			- Although the Spo2 can be improved by increasing the inspired oxygen concentration when the underlying problem is ventilation perfusion mismatching, increased oxygen should not be the first step unless there is concern for serious hypoxemia because increasing the Fio2 will obscure the underlying oxygenation problem.

		![[833A45BE-3D74-45DE-B5DA-C62BFC60AC5E.jpeg]]

	- **Goal 2: An acceptable Arterial Carbon Dioxide Tension (PaCO2)**:
		- Capnography (end-tidal CO2) used to approximate PaCO2.
			- Although end-tidal CO2 is often a close approximation of Paco2, it cannot be used as a reliable quantitative indicator. There is always a gradient between end-tidal and arterial co2, and the magnitude of that gradient cannot be predicted with certainty. In particular, as the tidal volume decreases, or dead space increases, the gradient between end-tidal and arterial co2 will increase so that it is possible to have a normal end-tidal CO2 along with significant hypercarbia.
		- Consider increased dead space and manual breaths to assess ventilation adequacy.
		- Accepting hypercarbia as part of lung-protective strategy if necessary.
	- **Goal 3: Desired Tidal Volume at Least Inspiratory Pressure**:
		- Monitor lung compliance (relationship between tidal volume and inspiratory pressure).
			- Pressure in the breathing circuit results from the flow of gas through the resistance of the endotracheal tube plus the volume of gas filling the lung compliance.
		- Lung compliance is calculated as the ratio of exhaled volume to inspiratory pressure.
			- Dynamic compliance is calculated as the exhaled volume divided by the peak pressure.
			- Static compliance is measured in the absence of flow as the ratio of exhaled volume to plateau pressure and is the most accurate reflection of true lung compliance.
		- Use PV loops (volume vs. pressure plots) to assess compliance changes.
			- During VCV and best-of-both-ventilation, because volume is constant, horizontal stretching of the loop to the right indicates reduced lung compliance. During PCV, because pressure is constant, vertical decreases in the loop indicate reduced lung compliance.

- Adjust ventilation strategy based on patient needs and real-time monitoring data.

# Paediatric Mechanical Ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit

- ## Introduction:
	- Ventilating pediatric patients requires understanding respiratory mechanics, cardiopulmonary pathophysiology, and the unique challenges posed by developing lungs and small patient size.
	- Focuses on mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients, excluding premature infants.
	
- ## Airway Management:
	- **Tracheal Tube Type**:
		- Cuffed TTs are increasingly popular due to reduced re-intubation rates compared to uncuffed TTs.
			- Early investigations showed that TTs with high-pressure, low-volume cuffs had similar rates of post-extubation stridor when compared with uncuffed TTs,1 but their use was eschewed in children due to concerns of subglottic stenosis.
				- Recent evaluations of modern low-pressure, high-volume cuff technology have shown similar airway outcomes and significantly reduced rates of re-intubation for air, gas leakage, or both compared with uncuffed TTs.
		- Cuff pressure should be monitored and kept below 20 cm H2O.
		- Uncuffed TTs should be sized to allow a leak ∼20 cm H2O
	- **Tracheal Tube Route**:
		- Debate between orotracheal vs. nasotracheal intubation; no significant difference in complication rates.
	- **Tracheal Tube Sizing**:
		- Age-based formulas, like Cole’s formula (uncuffed TT size=[(age in years)/4+4]), are more reliable for predicting TT size.
			- cuffed TT: predicted size would be 0.5 mm smaller than the uncuffed calculation.
			- estimations based on body size may be inaccurate as airway growth tends to occur in a relatively constant fashion, independent of individual body habitus.
		- Small reductions in TT diameter (due to secretions or bending) can significantly impact ventilation due to higher resistance in smaller tubes.
			- infant-sized TTs have proportionally higher resistances to flow compared with those used in adults. For example, a 6-month-old infant weighing 7 kg would be anticipated to require a 4.0 uncuffed or 3.5 cuffed TT. Compared with a 70 kg adult male intubated with an 8.0 TT, the resistance of a 4.0 TT is 16-times higher, and a 3.5 TT is 27-times higher (based on Poiseuille’s law)
		- Due to the higher resistance of smaller tubes, infants require additional pressure support when breathing spontaneously while intubated.
- ## Breathing Management:
	- **Oxygenation**:
		- Hypoxaemia is treated by:
			- increasing the fraction of inspired O2 to increase the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli
			- optimizing alveolar patency via recruitment manoeuvres
			- providing adequate PEEP to maintain functional residual capacity (FRC).
		- Adjusting FIO2 to maximize haemoglobin oxygen saturation remains a safe strategy in paediatrics with a few notable exceptions:
			- patients with unrestrictive single-ventricle cardiac physiology or large VSD may suffer from excessive pulmonary blood flow due to the decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) associated with increased oxygen delivery.
				- can lead to pulmonary over-circulation and decreased systemic cardiac output.
		- Excessive Fi02 may also lead to:
			- Atelectasis
			- Oxygen toxicity
		- Optimization of ventilation–perfusion matching and FRC is most effectively accomplished by adjusting the mean airway pressure
			- by making changes to the PEEP in combination with recruitment manoeuvres
		- HFOV (high frequency oscillatory ventilation) may be used in severe cases of ARDS but is less favored in adults.
			- theoretical benefit is based on the ability to recruit and maintain gas exchange units by using a higher mean airway pressure compared with conventional ventilation
				- considered in children with severe ARDS with refractory hypoxia, hypercapnia or both.
		- Advantages of HFOV:
			- reduces the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax associated with volutrauma and atelectrauma.
				- no robust literature supporting or refuting these claims.
		- Disadvantages to HFOV:
			- requires significant levels of patient sedation
			- poor secretion clearance
			- noisy
			- limited ability for patient monitoring
				- auscultation, end-tidal CO2 monitoring
	- **CO2 Clearance**:
		- **Alveolar Ventilation**:
			- Main target for CO2 clearance; PaCO2 is directly proportional to CO2 production and inversely proportional to CO2 clearance by alveolar ventilation.
		- **Permissive Hypercapnia**:
			- Commonly used in ventilated pediatric patients.
			- Strategy involves gradually increasing PaCO2 to <8–10 kPa with mild acidosis (pH 7.25–7.33).
			- Allows for lower plateau pressures and tidal volumes to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury.
			- Caution needed in patients sensitive to elevated PaCO2 or acidosis (e.g., pulmonary hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, increased ICP, sickle cell disease).
		- **Adjusting Minute Ventilation**:
			- Simple method: Adjust respiratory rate (RR).
			- No specific lower limit, but upper limit determined by expiratory time needed to avoid gas trapping.
			- Severe airway obstruction (e.g., asthma) may require low RR and long cycle times to allow full expiration.
		- **Low Tidal Volume (Vt) Strategies**:
			- Supported by evidence in adult ARDS and premature infants.
			- Superiority of low-Vt strategy not established outside these conditions.
			- Pediatric patients often ventilated with Vt ∼ 6 mL/kg, similar to or lower than adults.
		- **Dual/Hybrid Ventilation Modes**:
			- Combine advantages of volume and pressure control modes (e.g., pressure-regulated volume control).
			- Pressure-cycled breaths aim to achieve user-defined Vt.
			- Pressure is constant during inspiration, unlike classic volume control where flow is constant.
			- Ventilator adjusts pressure to maintain target Vt, adapting to dynamic changes in patient compliance.
			- Useful in situations requiring strict PaCO2 control, such as increased ICP.
	- **Work of Breathing**:
		- **Increased Respiratory Effort**:
			- Infants/children often use grunting and retractions to maintain oxygenation and CO2 clearance.
			- Higher metabolic effort compared to adults, leading to risk of rapid deterioration.
			- Deterioration is multifactorial: disease progression, hypoxemia, and/or CO2 retention.
			- Mechanical ventilation may improve oxygen delivery and consumption, especially in cases like heart failure or severe infection.
		- **Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV)**:
			- Effective for reducing work of breathing in various pediatric conditions.
			- Helps in viral bronchiolitis by improving compliance and reducing respiratory effort.
			- Manages severe airway obstruction in asthma by recruiting atelectatic regions and reducing hyperinflation.
			- Important to limit positive pressure to avoid gas trapping and hyperinflation.
			- Useful as an intermediary therapy post-extubation to prevent de-recruitment or manage stridor/stertor.
			- NIPPV often used with mild/no sedation; not all children tolerate it well.
			- Availability of NIPPV interfaces for all ages has reduced the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.
- ## Circulation:
- **Cardiorespiratory Interactions**:
	- Important for managing mechanically ventilated pediatric patients, even with normally functioning cardiovascular systems.
- **Extra-thoracic Venous Effects**:
	- Positive pressure reduces systemic venous return, impairing right ventricular preload.
	- More pronounced effects in pediatric patients due to lower systemic arterial pressures.
	- May lead to renal dysfunction, ascites, and intracranial hemorrhages, especially in young infants.
- **Extra-thoracic Arterial Effects**:
	- Positive intrathoracic pressure decreases left ventricular afterload, improving systemic blood flow.
	- Can support cardiac output in children with left ventricular dysfunction (e.g., mitral insufficiency, coronary artery abnormalities).
- **Intra-thoracic Venous/Arterial Effects**:
	- Pulmonary blood flow can be altered by positive pressure ventilation, even with corrected volume status.
	- Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is lowest at optimal airway distension (FRC).
	- PVR increases with underor over-distension, critical in newborns and patients with pulmonary hypertension.
- ## Ventilation in the Operating Theatre:
	- Appropriate tracheal tube (TT) sizing is crucial to ensure adequate ventilation with minimal gas leak.
	- Traditional anesthesia ventilators often had issues delivering accurate tidal volumes in small children due to fresh gas flow interactions and circuit compliance.
	- Modern ventilators improve tidal volume accuracy and pulmonary compliance monitoring.
	- Equipment-related dead space (e.g., tubing extensions, heat/moisture exchangers) can impair CO2 clearance.
	- Minimize connections between the 'Y' piece and TT in infants to reduce dead space.
- **Novel Techniques in Paediatric Ventilation**:
	- **HFJV**:
		- Used primarily in neonates; provides lung protection and stable hemodynamics.
	- **NAVA** (Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist):
		- Uses diaphragmatic electrical activity to synchronize ventilation; promising but requires more study.
- **Illustrative Case 1**:
	- 3-month-old with bronchiolitis: Managed with PCV, increasing PEEP, and permissive hypercapnia. Successfully extubated after improving oxygenation and ventilation.
- **Illustrative Case 2**:
	- 8-year-old with asthma: Treated with CPAP and continuous bronchodilators. Successfully transitioned back to standard therapy after stabilization.
