# Posterior Urethral Valves
- **Overview:** Congenital obstruction of the urethra; can be life-threatening in the neonatal period.
- **Diagnosis:** Often diagnosed antenatally due to fetal hydronephrosis.
- **Complications:** Oligohydramnios, which if coincides with pulmonary development, may lead to pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory complications at birth. Urethral obstruction causes back pressure affecting the entire urinary tract, leading to renal insufficiency.
- **Anesthetic Consideration:** Use of caudal anesthesia is recommended.

# Hypospadias
- **Overview:** Common condition where the external urethral meatus is located along the ventral surface of the penis; severity varies by the proximity of the meatus to the scrotum.
- **Associated Conditions:** Abnormal ventral curvature of the penis (chordee) and abnormal foreskin distribution with a ventral deficiency.
- **Surgical Approach:** Surgical repair is typically performed between 6–18 months to correct chordee and reconstruct the urethra (urethroplasty), aiming for good cosmetic outcomes.
- **Complex Cases:** More severe cases require complex reconstruction.
- **Genetic Considerations:** Associated with undescended testicles or ambiguous genitalia necessitates genetic and endocrine evaluation for conditions like congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).
- **Anesthetic Consideration:** Caudal anesthesia; penile block may be preferable for distal hypospadias to reduce urinary retention.

# Acute Scrotum
#### Differential Diagnoses
- Torsion of the Testis
- Torsion of the Spermatic Cord
- Torsion of the Appendage/Epididymis
- Epididymitis/Orchitis
- Hernia/Hydrocele
- Trauma/Sexual Abuse
- Tumor
- Idiopathic Scrotal Edema (Dermatitis, Insect Bite)
- Cellulitis
- Vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein Purpura)
- **Critical Timing:** A 4–8 hour window exists before ischemia causes irreversible damage to the testicle.
- **Epidemiology:** Sudden unilateral testicular pain in 13–21-year-olds is most likely due to testicular torsion (80–90% cases).
- **Procedure Note:** Testicular manipulation may elicit a vagal response.
- **Anesthetic Consideration:** MMA with caudal anesthesia.

# Circumcision, Preputioplasty, and Meatotomy
- **Standard Practice:** Routine circumcision for physiological phimosis is not recommended; the prepuce should be completely retractable by adolescence.
- **Anesthesia:** A ring block or dorsal nerve block of the penis is recommended.
- **Complications:** Possible complications include post-circumcision bleed.

# Cystoscopy and Urolithiasis
- **Procedure Note:** Insertion of the scope could cause laryngospasm.
- **Precautions:** Antibiotics required; hemorrhage could occur.
- **Anesthetic Management:** Fentanyl, along with local anesthetic gel applied locally to the urethra, may be sufficient for postoperative analgesia.
- **Complications:** A rare complication of seizures secondary to dilutional hyponatremia caused by absorption of irrigation fluid can be prevented by avoiding the use of hypotonic intravenous fluids.

# Orchidopexy
- **Overview:** Addresses cryptorchidism (absence of one or both testes from the scrotum), most commonly due to failure of testicular descent.
- **Incidence:** Affects 3.7% of term infants at birth, reducing to 1% by 3 months.
- **Long-term Risks:** Untreated, gradual loss of germ cells begins at age 2, leading to progressive atrophy, azoospermia, and increased cancer risk.
- **Surgical Timing:** Orchidopexy is typically performed between 6 and 12 months to preserve fertility and reduce cancer risk.
- **Surgical Approach:** May require a two-stage laparoscopic procedure for intraabdominal testes.
- **Anesthetic Consideration:** Ilioinguinal block or caudal extradural block depending on the approach.

# Nephrectomy
- **Indications:** Multicystic kidney disease, severe obstructive nephropathy, or renal malignancy (e.g., nephroblastoma).
- **Procedure:** Can be performed via laparoscopic or open surgery, depending on tumor stage and metastatic infiltration.
- **Preoperative Care:** Examination of CT reports for renal vein or inferior vena cava extension is crucial; crossmatched blood must be available.
- **Anesthetic Management:** Large bore intravascular access, invasive monitoring, potentially using esophageal Doppler for fluid management; remifentanil infusion for intraoperative analgesia, with consideration for an epidural block.
- **Postoperative Care:** Intensive monitored setting recommended.

# Prune Belly (Eagle-Barrett Syndrome)
- **Pathophysiology:** Characterized by urethral obstruction early in development leading to significant complications including massive bladder distention and pulmonary hypoplasia.
- **Surgical Considerations:** Abdominal wall reconstruction and orchidopexy are common; significant pulmonary disease often necessitates postoperative mechanical ventilation.
- **Anesthetic Considerations:** Controlled ventilation critical; high risk of vomiting and aspiration post-extubation.

# Laparoscopic Surgery in Children
#### Advantages
- Improved cosmetic results, lung and bowel function post-surgery, and reduced hospital stay.
#### Disadvantages
- Complications can arise from high insufflation pressures and positioning.
#### Anesthesia
- Endotracheal tube (ETT) with controlled ventilation; remifentanil infusion and local infiltration at port sites are typical.
# Vascular Access for Dialysis

### Vascular Access in Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)

#### Native Vein Arterial–Venous Fistula (AVF)

A native vein AVF is created by surgically joining a vein to a nearby artery, commonly for haemodialysis access. Compared to grafts, native AVFs offer superior long-term primary patency, a lower risk of thrombosis and infection, and decreased morbidity and mortality. They require time to mature (4–6 weeks on average) for vessel enlargement, allowing effective cannulation.

**Types of AVF:**
1. **Radiocephalic**:
   - Common first-line option.
   - Preserves proximal sites for later use.
   - Lowest flow rates.

2. **Brachiocephalic**:
   - Higher flow rates.
   - Increased risk of "steal syndrome," where blood is diverted from the distal limb, potentially leading to ischaemia.

3. **Brachiobasilic Transposition**:
   - More technically challenging due to vein inaccessibility.
   - Preserves vein integrity but carries the highest risk of "steal syndrome."
   - Often used after multiple failed distal fistulas.

**Complications:**
- **Aneurysm formation**: AVFs can enlarge over time, sometimes becoming aneurysmal.
- **Cardiac failure**: High blood flow through the AVF can lead to increased venous return and heart strain.
- **Steal Syndrome**: Diversion of arterial blood can cause distal limb ischaemia, potentially requiring surgical correction.

#### Arterial–Venous Graft (AVG)

AVGs are synthetic or biological prostheses used when native fistulas are not feasible. Synthetic grafts, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), are commonly used, although bioengineered alternatives are in development.

**Advantages of AVGs:**
- Easier cannulation and larger surface area.
- Shorter maturation time; some can be accessed immediately post-surgery.

**Disadvantages of AVGs:**
- Inferior long-term patency compared to native fistulas.
- Higher rates of thrombosis and infection, with a significant increase in salvage procedures.

**Common Graft Configurations:**
1. **Forearm Loop Graft**: Brachial artery to graft, graft to antecubital vein in a looped forearm configuration.
2. **Brachioaxillary Graft**: Brachial artery to graft, graft to axillary vein, placed in a straight configuration in the upper arm.
3. **Femoro-femoral Graft**: Femoral artery to graft, graft to femoral vein, positioned in a looped or straight configuration in the thigh.

#### Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) Catheters

PD catheters are often inserted laparoscopically under general anaesthesia. Removal may be simple but can be complicated by adhesions or infection, sometimes requiring mini-laparotomy.

### Anaesthetic Considerations in End-Stage Renal Failure (ESRF)

In ESRF, altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics influence anaesthetic drug use. Renal excretion is not the sole factor affecting drug handling; other considerations include volume status, protein binding, and metabolic acidosis.

#### General Considerations
1. **Volume Status**:
   - Dialysis timing affects fluid balance. Patients may be volume overloaded pre-dialysis (increased volume of distribution) or volume depleted post-dialysis (reduced volume of distribution and increased drug concentrations).
   
2. **Protein Binding**:
   - Hypoalbuminemia and reduced plasma proteins lead to increased free drug concentrations, especially for protein-bound drugs.

3. **Acidosis**:
   - Chronic metabolic acidosis alters drug ionization and increases free drug availability for protein-bound agents.

#### Specific Drugs and Adjustments

1. **Induction Agents**:
   - **Thiopental & Benzodiazepines**: Doses should be reduced by 30–50% due to decreased protein binding.
   - **Propofol**: Pharmacokinetics are unchanged, though higher doses may be needed to achieve hypnosis.
   
2. **Inhalational Agents**:
   - Ideal for maintenance of anaesthesia, as they are excreted via the lungs, bypassing renal pathways.

3. **Opioids**:
   - **Morphine**: Active metabolites, such as morphine-6-glucuronide, accumulate in renal failure, increasing toxicity risk. Dosing should be minimized, or alternatives considered.
   - **Oxycodone**: Effects are less prolonged in renal failure, making it a viable option.
   - **Fentanyl**: Lack of active metabolites makes it suitable for postoperative use.

4. **Muscle Relaxants**:
   - **Suxamethonium**: May exacerbate hyperkalaemia.
   - **Non-depolarizing Agents**: Maintenance doses of most relaxants require adjustment due to renal excretion.
   - **Atracurium**: Independent of renal function (Hofmann degradation), suitable for use in ESRF.
   - **Rocuronium & Sugammadex**: Prolonged action in renal failure due to partial renal excretion. Sugammadex is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min.

#### Local Anaesthetics
- **Metabolic Acidosis**: Reduces duration of action and increases the risk of toxicity due to elevated unbound drug levels. Maximum doses should be reduced by 25%.
- **Platelet Dysfunction**: Common in CRF, possibly contraindicating neuraxial blocks due to increased bleeding risks.
### Perioperative Considerations for Patients on Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)

#### Psychological Considerations

Patients on long-term RRT often structure their lives around treatment, which can have significant psychological effects. Awareness of the chronic nature of this condition and its emotional toll is important in the perioperative setting.

#### Preoperative Assessment

The preoperative assessment should focus on both the need for vascular access and the complications of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and RRT. Notable points include:

1. **Cardiovascular Disease**:
   - Incidence of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is twice that of the general population, making it the leading cause of mortality in patients on RRT.
   - Diabetes and sedentary lifestyles are common, with IHD often asymptomatic.

2. **Key Considerations**:
   - **Hypertension and peripheral vascular disease**.
   - **Ischaemic heart disease** and **congestive cardiac failure**.
   - **Diabetes** and associated **neuropathies**.
   - **Immunocompromise** from chronic disease and immunosuppressive medications.
   - **Anaemia**, **chronic hyperkalaemia**, **metabolic acidosis**, and **electrolyte imbalances**, particularly around the time of dialysis.

#### Investigations
1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**:
   - Mandatory in all patients to assess for dysrhythmias, ischaemia, and electrolyte disturbances.
   
2. **Blood Tests**:
   - Recent blood work, including full blood count and electrolytes, should be reviewed. Results should be interpreted in the context of chronic tolerance to electrolyte abnormalities and anaemia.
   - Proximity to dialysis is critical; patients may be fluid overloaded or volume depleted. It is useful to know the patient's "dry weight" to assess excess fluid volume.

#### Drug Considerations

Patients will typically be on a large number of medications, requiring careful review preoperatively, particularly:

- **Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents** (impact on surgery and regional anaesthesia).
- **Chemotherapeutic agents and disease-modifying drugs** (e.g., tacrolimus).
- **Steroids** (chronic use and potential perioperative stress doses).
- **Antihypertensives**, especially **beta-blockers**.
- **Hypoglycaemic agents** (oral and injectables).

#### Anaesthesia

##### Monitoring
- **Preserve current fistulas**: Blood pressure cuffs should be placed on the opposite arm or leg. Avoid arterial cannulation unless absolutely necessary to preserve future vascular access sites.
  
##### Vascular Access
- **Avoid fistulas for access**: Use peripheral cannulation, preferably on the back of the hand. Dialysis lines should not be used unless in an emergency, due to the risk of inadvertent heparin administration and complications.

#### Choice of Anaesthetic Technique

##### Local Anaesthesia
- Least physiologically invasive, but often poorly tolerated by patients. The location, extent of the incision, and depth of surgery may limit its use.

##### General Anaesthesia (GA)
- **No definitive best technique**: The choice depends on patient comorbidities, surgeon preferences, and patient history.
- **Considerations**:
   - Cardiovascular co-morbidities may lead to instability.
   - Neuropathies and gastroesophageal reflux may necessitate endotracheal intubation more frequently than in other populations.
   - Combining GA with regional anaesthesia (RA) is controversial due to potential haemodynamic compromise and the risk of fistula failure.

##### Regional Anaesthesia (RA)
- **Upper limb nerve blocks** are particularly useful for fistula creation. Benefits include:
   - Reduced need for anaesthetic drugs with unpredictable pharmacokinetics in renal failure.
   - Vasodilation increases vein diameter and blood flow, improving fistula outcomes.
   - Reduced postoperative analgesic requirements and shorter hospital stays.
- **Potential Pitfalls**:
   - Supplementary local anaesthetic may be required to block the intercostobrachial nerve (T2) for surgery involving the upper medial arm.
   - Incomplete blocks can be topped up by the surgeon.
   - RA is often combined with light sedation using fentanyl, midazolam, or propofol.

#### Role of Day Case Surgery

Patients with ESRD are not inherently excluded from day-case surgery, especially when regional techniques are used. It is feasible to discharge patients the same day following fistula creation surgery.

#### Timing of Surgery
- The **RRT schedule** must be taken into account. Haemodialysis is typically performed 3 times per week, while peritoneal dialysis is conducted nightly.
- Surgery does not need to coincide with dialysis, but a clear plan for the next dialysis session must be in place, especially if the patient typically dialses off-site. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances and drugs requiring renal clearance should be managed accordingly.

**Summary or mindmap:**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction

- Pediatric urological conditions are often emotionally challenging for patients and their families.
- Multimodal anesthesia (MMA) and caudal anesthesia are commonly used techniques in these cases.
- These urological conditions may be associated with other congenital or developmental disorders.

## Sensory Innervation of the Genitourinary Tract and Regional Blocks

- **Scrotal Innervation**
	- The anterior one-third of the scrotal skin receives sensory input from the **ilioinguinal nerve (L1)**.
	- The posterior two-thirds of the scrotal skin is innervated by the **perineal nerve (S2)**.
	- The lateral one-third is supplied by the **posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh (S3)**.
- **Pelvic and Bladder Innervation**
	- The pelvic sympathetic nerves from the **hypogastric plexus** inhibit the detrusor muscle of the urinary bladder and provide motor fibers to the internal sphincter.
	- **Clonidine**, an α-2 agonist, can be beneficial as an additive in epidural or caudal blocks to manage bladder spasms expected during operative procedures.
- **Central Blockade**
	- For operations involving the kidney, ureter, or testis, central blockade must reach up to the level of **T10–L1**.

### Ilioinguinal Block

- An ilioinguinal block alone is inadequate for any scrotal incision.
- The ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves, branches of the primary ventral rami of **L1 and T12**, provide sensory innervation to the skin over the anterior abdominal wall, upper medial thigh, and anterior third of the scrotum, as well as the root of the penis and labia majora in females.
- Injection is recommended just anterior and inferior to the **anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS)** with a volume of **0.5 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine**. A fascial pop is expected as the needle breaches the external oblique aponeurosis.

### Dorsal Penile Nerve Block

- Used primarily for procedures like circumcision or distal hypospadias.
- Injection site is above the root of the penis under the symphysis pubis directed posteriorly, medially, and slightly caudally. A loss of resistance indicates penetration of Buck’s fascia.
- Typically, **0.1 ml/kg of 0.5% bupivacaine** is injected at either side of the suspensory ligament, avoiding midline vessels.
