# Neonatal Resus

- Apgar score of 0–2 should be immediately intubated
- Indications for positive-pressure ventilation of the neonate include (1) apnea, (2) gasping respirations, (3) persistent central cyanosis with 100% oxygen, and (4) a persistent heart rate less than 100 beats/min.
- Excessive flexion or extension of the neck can cause airway obstruction. A 1-inch-high towel under the shoulders may be helpful in maintaining proper head position. Assisted ventilation by bag and mask should be at a rate of 30 to 60 breaths/min with 100% oxygen.Initial breaths may require peak pressures of up to 40 cm H2O, but pressures should not exceed 30 cm H2O thereafter
- Intubation is performed with a Miller 00, 0, or 1 laryngoscope blade, using a 2.5-, 3-, or 3.5-mm endotracheal tube (for neonates <1 kg, 1–2 kg, and >2 kg, respectively). correct depth of the endotracheal tube (“tip to lip”) is usually 6 cm plus the weight in kilogram
### Drugs
#### Epinephrine
 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg (0.1–0.3 mL/kg of a 1:10,000 solution)
#### Naloxone
- 0.1mg/kg IVI or 0.2mg/kg IMI
#### Sodium Bicarbonate
- 2 mEq/kg of a 0.5 mEq/mL 4.2%
- Severe metabolic acidosis documented by blood gas measurements and when ventilation is adequate. It may also be administered during prolonged (>5 min) resuscitation—particularly if blood gas measurements are not readily available
#### Calcium Gluconate
- 100 mg/kg
- should be given only to neonates with documented hypocalcemia or those with suspected magnesium intoxication (from maternal magnesium therapy); these neonates are usually hypotensive, hypotonic, and appear vasodilated
