# Common Medical Paediatric Emergencies

## Respiratory
- Most common reasons for presentation of children to hospital
- Greater risk from rapid deterioration due to their relatively higher oxygen consumption, smaller functional residual capacity and greater airway resistance. The cartilaginous components of their airway are softer and render the airway prone to dynamic obstruction with increased negative pressure as it occurs in respiratory distress. Hagen-Poiseuille’s equation, resistance to flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius. This means that significant increases in airway resistance can occur with only small amounts of mucosal swelling within the airway. Due to unfavourable respiratory mechanics, children develop respiratory failure quickly due to muscle fatigue
- **Signs of increased respiratory effort:** Tachypnoea, accessory muscle use, intercostal, subcostal or suprasternal recession, and abnormal sounds such as stridor, wheeze or grunting. Difficulty talking or feeding is also significant. Diminished breath sounds may be evidence of impending respiratory arrest and can be due to obstruction or exhaustion. Reduced conscious state, agitation and confusion
### Stridor
- **Causes:** Viral croup (acute viral laryngotracheobronchitis); Upper airway foreign body. Tonsillitis, anaphylaxis, tracheitis, diphtheria and epiglottitis
#### Croup

- Peak incidence in the age range of 6 months to 3 years
- Classically presents with a barking cough, that may be preceded by mild fever and runny nose. The cough often appears suddenly and stridor and respiratory distress may follow
- 1% require tracheal intubation
- Possible airway difficulty & complications: Consider double set-up, rigid bronchoscope, spontaneously breathing patient; Obstruction, laryngospasm; Respiratory fatigue/failure; Super infection with bacterial tracheitis possible
- Dehydration, need for volume replacement
- PICU & extubation plan
- **Treatment**
	- Nebulized epinephrine 0.5 ml/kg of 1:1000 to max 5 ml q15-20 min. Will wear off in 2 hours
	- Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO or 0.15-0.3 mg/kg IV
	- Budesonide 2 mg via neb (2 ml)
	- Humidified O2
	- Heliox
- **Approach to intubation:**
	- Perform in OR with difficult airway cart & ENT +/- rigid bronchoscopy
	- Usually by inhalation
	- Use small endotracheal tube, cuffed & stylet
#### Epiglottis

- Haemophilus influenzae type-b (Hib) vaccination has seen a 10-fold reduction in epiglottitis presentations
- **Impending airway obstruction:** Difficult bag mask ventilation & intubation
- Do not upset child or manipulate airway
- **Emergency:** risk of aspiration, ↓ time to optimize
- Sepsis & need for early goal-directed therapy  
- Pediatric patient considerations
- **Post-op disposition:** PICU & plan for extubation once process resolved
- **Management:**
	- Call for ENT ("double set up") & maintain spontaneous ventilation
	- Use smaller endotracheal tubes (1-3mm smaller)
	- OR set up with second anaesthetist or anaesthesia assistant & difficult airway cart, rigid bronchoscopy & tracheostomy set
	- Skin topicalization for IV start
	- Obtain CBC & blood cultures
	- Fluid bolus 20 ml/kg, repeat prn
	- Aspiration prophylaxis ranitidine 0.5 mg/kg & maxeran 0.1 mg/kg
	- Glycopyrrolate 10 mcg/kg to dry secretions
	- Small styletted ETT (cuffed preferable)
	- Spontaneously-breathing induction with sevoflurane or propofol/remifentanil if IV, then intubate
	- IV antibiotics, fluids, PICU​ post-op:
	- Antibiotics: cloxacillin, cetriaxone, ampicillin, clindamycin +/- vancomycin
	- Extubation plan: ensure there is a leak & swelling has resolved. Then extubate in the OR & be prepared for re-intubation
	- Don't use steroids empirically but consider if extubation has proven difficult after several days of antibiotic therapy
### Epiglottitis: Pathogenesis and Clinical Findings

#### Pathophysiology and Mechanism
1. **Infectious Cause:**
   - **Agents:** Bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis), most commonly Haemophilus influenzae in unimmunized children, and other viral or fungal agents.
   - **Process:**
	 - The infectious agent invades the bloodstream and/or the epithelial layer of the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, and adjacent structures, allowing for the spread.
	 - This results in the filling of the potential space between the squamous epithelial layer and the epiglottal cartilage with inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils.
	 - Inflammatory cells then spread through lymphatic and blood vessels in the lingual surface of the epiglottis and periepiglottic tissues.
	 - Fluid and inflammatory cells accumulate between the squamous epithelial layer and epiglottal cartilage.

2. **Non-infectious Cause:**
   - **Triggers:** Ingestion of toxins or foreign bodies, thermal injury, or trauma.

3. **Progression to Symptoms:**
   - Swelling of the supraglottic larynx from accumulated fluids and inflammatory cells leads to increased weight and mass of the epiglottis, causing it to curl posteriorly and inferiorly.
   - This swelling reduces the diameter of the upper airway, creating a ball-valve effect where airflow is obstructed during inspiration as the epiglottis is pulled over the airway but not during expiration as it moves back into position.

#### Signs, Symptoms, and Complications
1. **Airway Obstruction Signs:**
   - **Triad:** Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), inspiratory stridor (high-pitched sound from larynx obstruction), and a significant position of distress (tripod/sniffing position).
   - **Respiratory Distress:** Increased work of breathing, retraction of intercostal and suprasternal muscles, and tachypnea (rapid breathing).

2. **General Symptoms:**
   - **Voice Changes:** Muffled or "hot potato" voice due to swelling and pain.
   - **Other:** Drooling (from pain when swallowing), cyanosis (blue tint to skin from hypoxemia), and turbulent inspiratory airflow (due to airway obstruction).

#### Clinical Management Considerations
- **Diagnosis:** Careful assessment of airway patency, clinical history, and identification of potential infectious or traumatic causes.
- **Emergency Management:** Secure airway management prioritizing non-invasive measures when possible, administration of appropriate antibiotics if bacterial infection is suspected, and close monitoring of respiratory status.

### Status Asthma

- 17% of children required intubation
- Degree of wheeze does not correlate well with the severity
- Impending arrest signs include restlessness, confusion, inability to speak, inability to lie down, pulsus paradoxus, hypercapnia and hypoxia
- **Management:**
	- Oxygen, Bagonist, steroids and MGSO4
	- *Aminophylline does not achieve further bronchodilation and results in more adverse events*
	- Avoid intubation where possible (risk of barotrauma, cardiovascular collapse and aggravation of bronchospasm), consider CPAP
- **Indications for intubation:**
	- Cardiorespiratory arrest.
	- Respiratory arrest.
	- Acute severe hypoxaemia.
	- Severe hypercapnia (> 10 kPa) with clinical signs of life-threatening asthma (silent chest, poor respiratory effort, altered consciousness, cyanosis, SpO2 < 92%).
	- Progressive clinical deterioration (increasing respiratory distress, physical exhaustion, altered mental status) refractory to medical management
	- *Clinical deterioration and hypercapnia are most common reasons*
- **Induction**
	- Correct hypovolaemia as this may exacerbate hypotension due to the decreased venous return caused by positive pressure ventilation, concomitant medical therapy and induction agents
	- RSI with ketamine
## Sepsis

- 2nd most common cause of death in children 1-14 years
- Mortality is 10%
- Most common cause: Meningococcal sepsis
- **Signs**
	- Decreased or altered mental status
	- Prolonged capillary refill (>2 s)
	- Diminished pulses
	- Cool peripheries
	- Bounding peripheral pulses
	- Wide pulse pressure
	- Decreased urine output.
	- *Hypotension may not always be present*
- **Management:**
	- ABC
	- Boluses of 20 ml.kg isotonic fluid. Up to 200 ml.kg may be required in the first hour although 40–60 ml.kg is more common
	- After the second fluid bolus, if signs of shock persist, inotropic support
	- Intubation and ventilation should be considered
	- Ketamine for induction
	- Broad spectrum antibiotics, ABG and blood cultures
	- Arterial line and CVP
## Status Epilepticus

- Single convulsion lasting more than 30 min or two or more convulsions lasting more than 30 min without recovery of consciousness
- **Causes:** Prolonged febrile seizures, acute central nervous system infection, epilepsy, hypoxia and metabolic abnormalities such as hypoglycaemia
- **Management:**
	- Lorazepam 0.1 ml.kg x2 doses
	- Phenytoin 20 mg.kg
	- Phenobarbitone 20 ml.kg
	- Propofol induction (Avoid muscle relaxantsmight mask a seizure)

# Common Surgical Pediatric Emergencies

## Foreign Body Inhalation

### Overview

- **Age and Prevalence:** Most commonly seen in children around the mean age of 3 years, with 50% of cases occurring in children younger than 2 years.
- **Symptoms and Signs:**
	- Symptoms vary based on the size, location, and mobility of the foreign body, as well as the time since inhalation.
	- Common presentations include cough, wheeze, and dyspnea. Upper tracheal or glottic foreign bodies may cause stridor and/or voice changes.
	- Delayed symptoms can include fever, productive cough, and progressive respiratory distress.
	- Auscultation may reveal localized signs; stable symptoms usually indicate a non-mobile foreign body.
	- Fluctuating symptoms like intermittent stridor suggest a mobile foreign body, posing a higher risk.

### Diagnostic and Management Strategies

- **Initial Assessment:**
	- A history of a choking episode is highly indicative of an aspirated foreign body (AFB).
	- An effective cough suggests mild airway obstruction and potential self-resolution, while an ineffective cough indicates severe obstruction.
- **Diagnostic Tools:**
	- Chest X-ray is useful, though many foreign bodies are organic and not radiopaque.
- **Treatment:**
	- Conscious children with severe obstruction but ineffective cough should receive up to five back blows.
	- Unconscious children should be treated with CPR and advanced life support. Oral cavity sweeps should only be performed if the foreign body is visible.
	- Bag and mask ventilation has been successfully used as a primary treatment in severe cases.
	- Rigid bronchoscopy is the definitive treatment for removal of an AFB.

### Anesthesia Considerations

- **Preparation:**
	- Fasting protocols should be followed as for any surgical procedure unless the obstruction is distal.
	- Inhalational induction with topical local anesthetic applied to the airway is preferred to maintain spontaneous breathing.
- **Ventilation:**
	- Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) carries the risk of foreign body dislodgement. Comparative studies suggest fewer complications with paralysis and PPV than with spontaneous breathing, although assisted ventilation was needed in all spontaneous cases to maintain adequate oxygen saturation.

## Bleeding Tonsil

### Overview

- **Incidence:**
	- Primary bleeding occurs within the first 24 hours post-surgery in up to 2% of cases.
	- Secondary bleeding occurs in up to 5.5% of cases, typically between postoperative days 4 and 7, potentially resulting in hypovolemic shock and airway obstruction.

### Management Guidelines

- **Emergency Preparation:**
	- Ensure ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) are stable.
	- Establish IV access promptly and begin fluid resuscitation.
	- Prepare for potential difficult airway management; a difficult intubation trolley and two suction units should be readily available.
- **Surgical and Supportive Care:**
	- Hemoglobin levels and arterial blood gases (ABG) should be monitored.
	- Rapid sequence induction (RSI) may be necessary, and a smaller than previously used endotracheal tube should be considered to manage airway and bleeding effectively.
