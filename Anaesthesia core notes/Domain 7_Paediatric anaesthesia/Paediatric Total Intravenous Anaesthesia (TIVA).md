# Indications for Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) in Pediatric Cases

## Patient-Related Indications

- **Malignant Hyperthermia:** History, susceptibility, or risk
- **Neuromuscular Disorders:** Muscular dystrophy, core myopathy, or other neuromuscular diseases
- **Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) and Motion Sickness:** Previous history
- **Emergence Delirium:** Risk or previous history
- **Reactive Airways:** Acute or chronic reactivity
- **Facemask:** Fear of use
- **Allergy Risk:** Minimization
## Surgical Indications

- **Airway Procedures:** Surgery or shared airway procedures
- **Evoked Potential Monitoring:** Required in surgeries like scoliosis procedures
- **Neurosurgical Procedures**
- **Middle Ear Surgery**
- **High PONV Risk Procedures:** E.g., Strabismus, Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy (T&A)
## Procedural Indications

- **Remote Site Anesthesia:** E.g., MRI
- **Neuromuscular Diagnosis:** Muscle biopsy
# Advantages and Disadvantages of TIVA in Pediatric Cases

## Clinical Advantages

- **Reduced Airway Reactivity:** Including laryngospasm and bronchospasm
- **Improved Circulatory Function:** Bronchodilation and less hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
- **Delirium and PONV:** Reduced emergence delirium and PONV
- **Neuromuscular Disease Management:** Applicable in cases with neuromuscular complications
## Practical Advantages

- **Evoked Potentials:** No interference with monitoring
- **Anesthesia Management:** Titratable and easily delivered via pump
- **Remote Site Anesthesia Maintenance:** Maintenance of spontaneous ventilation (SV)
- **Environmental Impact:** No vapor pollution and associated with overall reduced costs
## Clinical Disadvantages

- **Contamination Risks:** Increased risk of bacterial contamination
- **Injection Discomfort:** Pain upon injection
- **Metabolic Concerns:** Risk of propofol infusion syndrome (Prise) and metabolic acidosis
#### Practical Disadvantages

- **Equipment Needs:** Requires intravenous access and infusion pumps
- **Monitoring Limits:** Potential EEG monitoring unavailability and unreliable anesthesia depth without a monitor
- **Propofol Measurement:** Lack of cost-effective point-of-care propofol measurement systems
## Other Considerations

- **Procedure Length and Patient Factors:** Caution advised in prolonged procedures or in obese patients due to propofol’s long half-life
- **Environmental Concerns:** Plastic waste and propofol disposal issues; disposables may be costly

# Pharmacology

## General
- Larger central compartment and volume of distribution; greatest in infants and decreasing with age to adult levels. This requires a higher bolus dose and initial infusion rate.
- There is a greater rate of clearance, peaking at around 1 yr of age. This requires higher maintenance rates
- In the obese population, propofol induction doses are proportional to lean body mass, while maintenance doses are linked to total body weight.
## Propofol
- Context-sensitive half-life in children has been derived to be longer than in adults; 10.4 vs 6.7 min after 1 h infusion, 19.6 vs 9.5 min after 4 h.
- *Paedfusor* uses age and weight as covariates; it can be used between 5 and 61 kg, and 1–16 yr of age.
- *Kataria* can be used from 3 to 16 yr of age and works with a minimum weight of 15 kg
#### Steur Recommendations for Patients Under 3 Years

| Time           | <3 Months   | 3-6 Months  | 6-12 Months | 1-3 Years  |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 0-10 min       | 25 mg/kg/h  | 20 mg/kg/h  | 15 mg/kg/h  | 12 mg/kg/h |
| 10-20 min      | 20 mg/kg/h  | 15 mg/kg/h  | 10 mg/kg/h  | 9 mg/kg/h  |
| 20-30 min      | 15 mg/kg/h  | 10 mg/kg/h  | 5 mg/kg/h   | 6 mg/kg/h  |
| 30-40 min      | 10 mg/kg/h  | 5 mg/kg/h   | 5 mg/kg/h   | 6 mg/kg/h  |
| 40-100 min     | 5 mg/kg/h   | 5 mg/kg/h   | 5 mg/kg/h   | 6 mg/kg/h  |
| Remaining time | 2.5 mg/kg/h | 2.5 mg/kg/h | 2.5 mg/kg/h | 6 mg/kg/h  |

### McFarlan Recommendations for Patients Aged 3-11 Years

Targeting blood concentration of 3ug/ml

| Duration  | Bolus Dose | µg/kg/min | mg/kg/h |
| --------- | ---------- | --------- | ------- |
| 0-15 min  | 2.5 mg/kg  | 250       | 15      |
| 15-30 min |            | 215       | 13      |
| 30-60 min |            | 185       | 11      |
| 1-2 hrs   |            | 165       | 10      |
| 2-4 hrs   |            | 150       | 9       |

## Remifentanil
- Synergistic effect with propofol and is a valuable adjunct
- There is an associated incidence of respiratory depression with its use, but a higher dose is tolerated for SV in children compared with adults; between 0.05 and 0.3 μgkg−1 min−1,with younger children maintaining SV more effectively at higher doses.
- The reduction in respiratory rate can be used as a marker for titration (see airway example), either aiming for a respiratory rate of <15 or a 50% reduction in younger children
- Remifentanil can be given as a weight-based infusion or via TCI models; a weight-based infusion has an almost linear relationship between target level and infusion rate
- The Minto model has a minimum weight of 30 kg, minimum age of 12 yr, and uses height as a covariate.
## Propofol with Remifentanil
- Propofol and remifentanil can be combined in the same syringe in varying proportions for practicality and ease of delivery depending on the clinical situation (see example); concentrations of 2.5, 5, and 10 μg of remifentanil per millilitre of propofol are infused. They can be weaned or stopped together for emergence
## Adjuncts
- α-2-adrenergic agonists, clonidine or dexmedetomidine
# Example
- Proceed with inhalation or i.v. induction followed by separate propofol and remifentanil infusions.
- Titrate propofol boluses to maintain SV and then 200–400 μgkg−1 min−1 titrated against a target pEEG index of 30–40
- Use remifentanil 0.2–0.3 μgkg−1 min−1 (less with increasing age) titrated to target a respiratory rate at the low end of normal for the age of the child; beware of marked tidal volume variation as this may indicate imminent apnoea. The margin between an awake and an apnoeic patient becomes narrower with age.
- The addition of 0.5–1 μgkg−1 bolus of dexmedetomidine widens this margin
