# Introduction
### Craniosynostosis

- **Definition:**
	- Craniosynostosis is a common craniofacial congenital abnormality involving the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures.
- **Pathophysiology:**
	- Premature suture fusion leads to a failure of normal bone growth perpendicular to the affected suture.
	- Compensatory growth at other suture sites results in a characteristic abnormal head shape.
- **Incidence:**
	- Occurs in one in 3000 live births.
- **Types:**
	- **Isolated Craniosynostosis:**
		- Accounts for 80% of cases.
		- Usually simple and not associated with other abnormalities.
		- Etiology is non-genetic, often due to intrauterine fetal head constraint.
	- **Syndromic Craniosynostosis:**
		- Accounts for 20% of cases.
		- Occurs as part of a syndrome involving other abnormalities.

### Syndromes
- Syndromes associated with craniosynostosis:
	- Muenke
	- Apert
	- Crouzon
	- Pfeiffer Saethre-Chotzen
- **Syndromic Craniosynostoses**
	- Often complex; more than one suture affected
	- Frequently have an identifiable genetic cause
	- Associated with other facial bony abnormalities and extra-cranial features
	- Can lead to raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in 40-70% of cases
		- Causes of raised ICP:
			- hydrocephalus
			- airway obstruction
			- craniocerebral disproportion
			- abnormalities in venous drainage
		- Symptoms:
			- headaches
			- irritability
			- seizures
			- developmental delay
			- blindness
			- death
		- Treatment directed at specific cause; part of complex surgical management
- **Inheritance and Genetic Causes**
	- Mostly autosomal dominant inheritance
	- Majority attributed to new mutations from unaffected parents
	- Mutations in genes coding for fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are common
		- FGFs bind to FGFRs, controlling growth and differentiation of various cells
		- Abnormal interaction leads to defective intracellular signaling
- **Specific Syndromes**
	- **Apert Syndrome**
		- Mutation in FGFR2 gene
			- FGF binds rto FGFR 2 for a prolonged time, prematurely signaling for immature bone cells to differentiate and cause suture fusion.
		- Incidence: 1 in 65,000 births
		- Features:
			- bicoronal synostosis
				- leads to brachycephaly
			- large open anterior and posterior fontanels which frequently connect
			- midface hypoplasia
				- airway problems
				- obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
			- shallow eye sockets (exorbitism)
				- corneal exposure
				- dislocation of the eyes
		- Additional features
			- complex, symmetrical syndactyly of at least the central three digits
	- **Crouzon Syndrome**
		- Mutation in FGFR2 gene located on chromosome 10
		- Features: normal hands and feet
	- **Pfeiffer Syndrome**
		- Mutation in FGFR2 gene on chromosome 10
		- Features:
			- broad, radially deviated thumbs and great toes
			- possible cloverleaf skull deformity
				- most severe form of Pfeiffer syndrome
				- All of the cranial sutures are fused
	- **Muenke Syndrome**
		- Mutation in FGFR3 gene
		- Commonest syndrome; ~30% of all coronal synostosis
		- Features:
			- facial features can be mild
			- low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss
		- Genetic testing for those with brachycephaly important for assessing the prognostic outcome of surgery
			- risk of re-operation is much greater for those with Muenke syndrome than those with nonsyndromic coronal craniosynostosis.
- **Other Syndromes**
	- **Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome**
		- Caused by mutations in the TWIST1 gene
	- **Craniofrontonasal Syndrome**
		- Caused by a mutation in the EFNB1 gene
### Surgical Considerations in Craniosynostosis

#### Timing of Surgery
**Emergency Indications:**
1. Urgent need to protect the airway.
2. Urgent need to protect the eyes.
3. Management of acutely or chronically raised ICP.
**Elective Surgery:**
- Optimal timing is controversial.
- **Early Surgery (3-6 months):**
	- Advantages:
		- Soft, easily reshaped bone
		- Brain growth drives cranial vault growth.
	- Disadvantages:
		- Increased risk of repeat surgery
		- Higher risk due to smaller blood volume.
- **Later Surgery:**
	- Advantages:
		- Reduced risk of reoperation.
	- Disadvantages:
		- Thicker bone harder to remodel
		- Severe deformities harder to correct
		- Older children lose ability to ossify small craniectomy defects
			- May require bone grafting.
- **Oxford Craniofacial Unit Approach:**
	- Surgery around 1 year of age to balance early and later surgery benefits.
#### Surgical Procedures
**General Principles:**
1. Prevent progression of the abnormality.
2. Correct the abnormality.
3. Reduce risk of raised ICP.
**Surgery addresses:**
- Fused suture.
- Restricted calvarial components.
- Compensatory overgrowth areas.
#### Surgery Types

##### Sagittal Synostosis
1. **Extended Strip Craniectomies:**
	- Early life excision of fused suture.
		- Performed in first few months of life
	- Limited expansion of adjacent bone.
	- Relies on early, rapid brain growth for calvarial remodeling.
	- High restenosis rate; 29% normal cephalic index resolution.
		- Poor resolution of cephalic index (ratio of maximum width of the head multiplied by 100 divided by maximum length)
		- Compared to 66% in cranial vault remodeling
2. **Spring-Assisted Cranioplasty:**
	- Sagittal strip craniectomy with springs across osteotomy defect.
	- Gradual biparietal separation.
	- Springs removed after 6 months under GA.
	- Favorable but less positive results than calvarial remodeling.
	- Advantages:
		- Reduced blood loss
		- shorter operative time
		- shorter hospital stay.
3. **Total Calvarial Remodeling:**
	- Addresses fused suture and compensatory deformities.
	- Vital meticulous surgical technique due to sagittal venous sinus location.
**Frontal Orbital Advancement and Remodeling (FOAR):**
- Remodeled frontal bone and advanced supraorbital rims.
- Corrects superior orbital rim recession.
- Protects eyes in severe exorbitism.
- Fundamental for metopic and coronal synostosis correction.

![[FB937B59-484E-4F22-BF46-906F93C756AC.jpeg]]

**Posterior Expansion and Remodeling:**
- Used in severe progressive turricephaly (secondary to bicoronal synostosis) and raised ICP.
- Releases posterior calvarium.
- Released bone distracted using distractors or springs.
**Midface Advancement (Le Fort III and Monobloc Procedures)**
- Key Feature of Syndromic Synostoses:
	- Additional midfacial hypoplasia.
- Addressing Midfacial Hypoplasia:
1. **Monobloc Advancement:**
	- Performed during cranial vault surgery.
	- Involves advancement of the frontal bone, supraorbital bar, and midface.
2. **Le Fort III Advancement:**
	- Staged at a later date.
**Unit Practice for Midfacial Advancement Surgery in Children:**
- Perform a tracheostomy 2 weeks prior if a rigid external device (RED) frame is planned.
- RED frame presence complicates conventional laryngoscopy during an airway crisis.
	- Vertical bar of RED frame can be removed.
	- Laryngeal mask use has been described.

	![[E420D776-AC6B-4616-8655-BC32ADCE9A3C.jpeg]]

### Preoperative Anaesthetic Issues of Craniofacial Synostosis

**Airway:**
- Thorough airway assessment.
- Previous anesthesia episodes (e.g., for radiological imaging) can provide valuable information about airway management and venous access.
- Syndromes like Apert and Crouzon present airway problems.
- **Apert Syndrome:**
	- Midface hypoplasia and proptosis complicate face mask ventilation.
	- Small nares and choanal stenosis cause high nasal airflow resistance; patients are obligate mouth breathers.
	- Simple maneuvers, OPAs, NPAs, and CPAP can relieve obstruction.
	- Some children have fused cervical vertebrae.
	- Intubation via direct laryngoscopy is usually successful but more difficult post-frontofacial advancement.
- Ensure endotracheal tube is not kinked, compressed, or accidentally dislodged.
- Types of endotracheal tubes vary (oral/nasal, standard/reinforced, south-facing Ring-Adair-Elwyn, nasal cuffed tubes).
- Secure endotracheal tube with adhesive tape, sutures, or wiring.

**Respiratory System:**
- 6.1% of Apert syndrome patients have respiratory complications.
- Recent upper respiratory tract infection is a risk factor for intraoperative complications.
- Common complication: wheezing, potentially severe enough to abandon the operation.
- Causes of wheezing: lower airway compromise caused by stiff/fused tracheal rings and secretions
	- responds to:
		- tracheal suctioning
		- deepened anesthesia
		- bronchodilator therapy.

**Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA):**
- 50% of patients with Apert, Crouzon, or Pfeiffer syndromes develop OSA.
- Midface hypoplasia distorts nasopharyngeal anatomy.
- Early intervention with NPA, CPAP, or tracheostomy may be required.
- These children are often scheduled for tracheostomy 1-2 weeks prior to definitive craniofacial surgery
	- allows tract to become established
	- smoother intraoperative and postoperative course.
- Debate exists on tracheostomy timing and management (early insertion vs. NPA and CPAP).
- During anesthesia induction, airway obstruction management is critical.
- Chronic upper airway obstruction impacts cardiovascular and central nervous systems.
- Upper airway obstruction increases ICP and decreases CPP during sleep, affecting neurological and cognitive development.

![[4BC7AFFE-D3B6-4974-9C82-12DB3FA70A5D.jpeg]]

**Induction and Maintenance of Anesthesia:**
- Method of induction depends on:
	- Anesthetist’s experience
	- Patient, and parental preference.
- The general pro–con debate that exists around intravenous vs gaseous induction in pediatric patients applies to this patient group
	- distress caused by holding a mask over the face vs discomfort with intravenous cannulation
- Intravenous access may be difficult due to fat on the dorsum of the hand; gaseous induction often preferred.
- Maintain spontaneous ventilation to minimize airway obstruction risk.
	- OPA may be needed to improve quality of the airway
- Inhalational induction with sevoflurane is common, with two anesthetists preferred.
- Maintenance with volatile agents and oxygen/air mixture (no nitrous oxide due to VAE risk).
- Administer fentanyl bolus (10-15ug/kg) and muscle relaxant at the beginning; morphine, paracetamol, and antiemetics toward the end.
	- Other institutions use infusions of remifentanil perioperatively.
	- Pietrini compared remifentanil and sevoflurane with remifentanil and isoflurane in children undergoing surgery for synostosis.
		- No difference in hemodynamic parameters and recovery time

**Temperature Regulation:**
- Start warm air devices immediately; use fluid warmers throughout surgery.

**Positioning:**
- Ensure optimal surgical access and minimize complications.
- Positions: supine, prone, or modified prone ("sphinx position").
	- The modified prone position (‘sphinx position’): patient prone with head and neck extended so that the chin rests on a support.
		- hyperextension of the neck may result in spinal cord injury
![[23D83DDF-CEBC-4BE3-8057-7103A69A170E.jpeg]]

- Avoid direct pressure on the neck to minimize ICP and venous bleeding.
	- Postoperative airway problems may result from macroglossia, secondary to neck flection compromising venous and lymphatic drainage.
- Horizontal positioning (neutral or no tilt on table) to balance venous bleeding control and VAE risk.
- Pay attention to areas at risk of neurovascular compromise due to prolonged pressure effects
	- Ensure adequate padding over invasive lines or monitoring leads in direct contact with the skin.
- The orbits are at increased risk because of the associated proptosis:
	- Corneal abrasions and irritation from cleaning solutions can be minimized by topical lubricant, such as LacrilubeÒ, and temporary tarsorrhaphy.
	- Another mechanism for ophthalmic injury is by direct orbital pressure:
		- damage to the optic nerve and retinal ischemia resulting in postoperative blindness.
		- Acute presentation of direct orbital pressure occurring during surgery may be a vagally mediated bradycardia, most likely seen in FOAR surgery
- Perform head lifts every 15 minutes in prone position.

**Monitoring:**
- Sudden cardiovascular changes and rapid blood loss are possible.
- Use central venous catheter and arterial line (prefer femoral lines).
	- Central venous readings can be unreliable but trends are extremely useful
- Essential monitoring: blood pressure, frequent blood sampling, end-tidal capnography for VAE detection.

**Neuroanesthesia:**
- Children may have raised ICP; consider CPP at induction and maintenance.
- Aim for ICP < 10 mmHg; ICP > 15 mmHg is intracranial hypertension.
	- Many children with complex craniosynostosis will have had ICP monitoring to assist with decisions regarding operative intervention.
	- Normal CPP varies with age, and in the absence of published data, consensus opinion describes a CPP of 40–50 mmHg in infants and small children.
- Minimize factors increasing ICP (hypercapnia, hypoxia) and venous pressure.
- VAE is common; detected by precordial Doppler.
- High incidence of VAE in infants due to rapid blood loss causing a decrease in CVP and so the development of a pressure gradient between the right atrium and surgical site favoring the entrainment of air.
	- Episode of hypotension precipitated by blood loss can be immediately followed by a VAE.
- VAE episodes mostly without hemodynamic compromise.
- Treat VAE by flooding surgical field and lowering head position.
- VAE consequences:
	- hypotension
	- cardiovascular collapse
	- paradoxical air embolism in presence of patent foramen ovale.
		- neurological sequelae
### Bleeding and Hemorrhage Control
**Blood Loss and Measurement:**
- Massive blood loss is a major challenge; transfusion is often unavoidable.
- Successful management requires anticipation, knowledge of procedure, and vigilance.
- Increased blood volume loss (BVL) in small children due to large head surface area and proportionally greater blood volume.
- Prolonged surgery (>5 hours) increases BVL, donor exposure, and transfusion needs.
- Syndromic synostosis often requires complex, prolonged surgery.
- Hypothermia contributes to coagulopathy, but early interventions can maintain normothermia.

**Surgical Stages with Blood Loss:**
- Initial scalp dissection and raising periosteum can cause sudden, extensive blood loss.
	- maintain intravascular volume
- Gradual but significant blood loss can occur throughout the procedure and postoperatively.
- Communication between surgeon and anesthetist is vital for managing hemorrhage.
- Direct assessment of BVL is difficult.
	- Blood collected in the suction is often minimal.
	- Majority of blood lost to surgical drapes and the surrounding area.
	- Calculating BVL is often dependent upon assessing the required volume of fluid resuscitation and blood products transfused.
- Postoperative blood loss can be more accurately measured with surgical drains.

**Transfusion Triggers:**
- Vary by center and situation.
- During rapid blood loss, hemodynamic parameters guide transfusion.
- During stability, absolute triggers include hemoglobin levels (7-8 g/dL) or hematocrit (0.27-0.3).
- Early transfusion strategy involves preemptive transfusion after coronal opening, but may result in over-transfusion.
	- Early transfusion involves a transfusion of 20% of the estimated red cell volume combined with a third of this volume of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and a crystalloid infusion of 8ml/kg/hr.

**Albumin and Hemodynamic Instability:**
- Albumin administration increases postoperative coagulation disturbance.
- Other causes of intraoperative hypotension include venous air embolism (VAE) and anaphylaxis.

**Reducing Homologous Blood Transfusion and Cell Salvage:**
- Risks of homologous blood transfusion (HBT) include:
	- Hemolytic reactions
	- Transfusion-related lung injury
	- Infection
	- Complications of massive transfusion
		- Coagulopathy
		- Electrolyte and acid-base disturbance
- Strategies to reduce HBT:
	- Preoperative optimization of hematocrit (Hct):
		- diagnosis and treatment or pre-existing anemia
		- iron supplementation, and erythropoietin (EPO).
	- EPO increases preoperative Hct and decreases transfusion needs.
		- EPO given subcutaneously weekly for 3–4 weeks prior to the surgery can markedly increase the preoperative Hct by 28–56% and decrease transfusion requirements
	- Autologous transfusion is difficult in pediatric patients due to young age and low blood volume.
	- Meticulous surgical technique and use of adrenaline-containing solutions and diathermy reduce BVL.

**Cell Salvage:**
- Increased interest in cell salvage due to concerns over HBT safety.
- Studies show variable results; some report reduced homologous blood exposure, especially when combined with other techniques like EPO.
- Dahmani et al. and Carver et al. report reduced donor exposure with cell salvage.

**Blood Dilution Techniques:**
- Acute normovolemic hemodilution involves removing blood and replacing with crystalloid/colloid, then reinfusing at surgery's end; no significant benefit shown in reducing allogenic transfusion.
- Hypervolemic hemodilution has also been used.
- Controlled hypotension is employed in other surgeries to decrease blood loss, but limited in craniosynostosis surgery due to cerebral perfusion pressure concerns.

![[766283D2-3ACE-476C-942C-D33E23DD5F70.jpeg]]

### Coagulation

**Preoperative Coagulation:**
- Majority of pediatric craniofacial patients have normal coagulation.
- Routine preoperative coagulation profiles are not checked unless clinically indicated.
**Intraoperative Coagulation Issues:**
- Deranged coagulation occurs due to significant blood loss and transfusion of packed red cells.
- Decline in whole blood use contributes to coagulopathy in massive transfusion cases.
- Study by Williams et al. (17) findings:
	- 5 of 27 patients lost >100 ml/kg blood, leading to prolonged PT, INR, partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and TEG reaction time.
	- Fibrinolysis was not associated with increased bleeding and platelet function as illustrated by the fact that the TEG maximum amplitude was within normal limits.
	- No severe factor deficiencies identified.
	- Dilution of clotting factors causes abnormal clotting profile.
	- Administration of blood products required for correction.
	- 22 patients losing <100 ml/kg did not need coagulation correction.
**Postoperative Blood Loss:**
- Blood loss approximately equal to intraoperative loss.
- Normal coagulation tests postoperatively suggest blood loss is not due to deranged coagulation.
- Postoperative bleeding likely due to large exposed bone surfaces.
**Coagulation Product Administration:**
- Unit protocols guide administration.
- Indications include:
	- PT/APTT >1.5x normal.
	- Fibrinogen <0.8-1 g/L.
	- Platelet count <50-80,000/µL.
	- Clinical evidence of coagulopathy.
- Empirical use of hemostatic blood products when BVL approaches 1.5x blood volumes.
**Variability in FFP Use:**
- Different centers have varied percentages of patients receiving FFP.
- Some centers use a 1:1 ratio for transfusion of packed red cells and FFP to avoid dilutional coagulopathy.
- Criticism: Potential for unnecessary administration and multiple donor exposures.
- Defense: Use of FFP and packed cells from a single donor to minimize risks.
**Antifibrinolytic and Other Agents:**
- Aprotinin previously used to reduce transfusion requirements (withdrawn from practice).
- Vitamin K, activated factor VII, desmopressin (DDAVP), and fibrinogen concentrates used to enhance coagulation.
- Tranexamic acid shown to lower perioperative blood loss and mean blood transfusion in some studies.
	- Studies by Goobie et al. and Dandure et al. included around 40 patients, demonstrating efficacy across various surgical conditions.
	- Debate in literature about exact mechanism by which tranexamic acid helps to reduce blood loss
### Metabolic Disturbance

- **Acid-Base and Electrolyte Derangement:**
	- Related to significant blood loss and transfusion of crystalloid and colloid.
- **Hypocalcemia:**
	- Incidence: 10% (calcium <0.9 mM) due to citrated blood transfusion.
- **Hyperkalemia:**
	- Incidence: 45% (potassium >5.5 mM) due to transfusion of stored packed cells.
	- Packed cells stored >2 weeks contain >40 mM potassium; cells stored <1 week contain <20 mM.
- **Base Deficit:**
	- Median base excess (BE) was -9; median normalization time: 9.25 hours.
	- 39% had BE < -10; maximum base deficit occurred at end of surgery.
	- Significant relationship between base deficit and volume of blood/colloid given.
	- Significant relationship between crystalloid volume and intraoperative metabolic acidosis.
	- In 25% of patients, the initial base deficit, taken at the time of insertion of the arterial line, was <-4.
		- Could be explained by ketoacidosis developing as a consequence of preoperative starvation.
### Analgesia
- **Intraoperative Analgesia:**
	- Opiate-based: high-dose fentanyl, remifentanil, and morphine.
- **Postoperative Analgesia:**
	- Varies by unit protocols: regular paracetamol (often intravenous) and opiates.
	- Recent prospective audit of our postoperative analgesia regime revealed that the majority of patients were successfully managed on a morphine nurse controlled analgesia (NCA) regime with a background of 20ug/kg/hr, and bolus doses of 20ug/kg with a 20-min lockout (unpublished data).
		- Average number of morphine bolus doses in the initial 24 h postoperatively was 15.
		- Pain scores assessed using a behavioral scoring system.
		- The modal pain score was zero in 92% of patients (i.e. no pain), and 29% patients had an episode(s) of pain that was classed as severe/excruciating.
		- No complications associated with the use of morphine NCA in this patient group.
		- Sedation scores of these children (0–awake; 1–asleep, responds to verbal/physical stimuli; 2–asleep, poor response to verbal/physical stimuli; 3–no response to verbal/physical stimuli) were recorded as modal scores of 0 for 46% and 1 for 50% of patients.
		- A sedation score of 1 was the highest (worst) sedation score for 92% of patients.
### Nausea and Vomiting

- **Incidence:**
	- 60% of children vomited within first 24 hours; 40% vomited only once.
- **Perioperative Management:**
	- All received perioperative dexamethasone; ondansetron given to a subset.
	- Vomiting episodes mainly in the first 8 hours postoperatively.
	- Change in management due to clinical significance of findings.
	- Ondansetron recommended for prevention of postoperative vomiting.
### Postoperative Management

- **Extubation:**
	- Most patients extubated at end of surgery or immediate postoperative period.
- **Factors for Continued Intubation:**
	- Prolonged anesthesia/surgery
	- Increased crystalloids/packed red cells
	- Preoperative respiratory compromise
	- Obstructive sleep apnea.
- **Care Units:**
	- Majority cared for in pediatric high dependency or intensive care units.
- **Postoperative Protocols:**
	- Detail management of drain losses, intravenous fluid therapy, and transfusion triggers.
	- Drain losses monitored, blood gas measurements performed, urine output guided fluid management.
	- Intravenous opiates for initial 24 hours; oral analgesics introduced thereafter.
		- Debate still exists around the association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and bleeding. Some centres choose to commence these 24 h after surgery.
- **Serum Biochemistry and Hematology:**
	- Close attention to avoid hyponatremia (risk of cerebral edema, seizures, death).
	- Use of sodium-containing fluids both intraoperatively and postoperatively.
**Hyponatremia:**
- **Incidence:**
	- 30.6% after cranial vault remodeling.
- **Factors:**
	- Syndromic craniosynostosis
	- Greater BVL
	- Raised intracranial pressure.
- **Impact:**
	- Related to prolonged ICU stay but not postoperative complications.
