# General Insights
- In paediatric anaesthesia, the risk of aspiration appears to be slightly lower compared to adults.
- Children who have aspirated tend to experience less severe sequelae than adults.
## Risks Associated with Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI)
- **Hypoxia (SO₂ <90%)**: 3.6% risk
- **Severe hypoxia (SO₂ <80%)**: 1.7% risk
- Children under 20 kg are at greater risk of both hypoxia and severe hypoxia.
- **Hypotension (Systolic BP <70 mmHg)**: 0.8% risk
- **Bradycardia (HR <60 bpm)**: 0.5% risk
- **Note**: The incidence of these complications during RSI is higher than the published risks of aspiration itself.
## Aetiology of Aspiration in Paediatric Patients
### Passive Aspiration
- **Lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) incompetence or distension**.
- **Common Causes**:
	- Gastric distension from bag mask ventilation.
	- Accidental oesophageal intubation.
	- Abdominal distension from other causes such as intestinal obstruction, intra-abdominal tumours, and ascites.
### Active Aspiration (Vomiting)
- Vomiting can occur when airway instrumentation is performed before an adequate depth of anaesthesia is reached, triggering coughing and vomiting.
## Anatomical and Physiological Factors Increasing Risk of Aspiration in Children
- **Shorter Oesophagus**: Infants have a shorter oesophagus, bringing the stomach closer to the larynx, increasing aspiration risk.
- **Angle of His**: This angle is obtuse in newborns and becomes more acute as the infant grows, but in early stages, it may predispose to gastroesophageal reflux (GOR).
- **Gastric Compliance**: Infants exhibit decreased gastric compliance, which can lead to lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation at lower intragastric pressures.
- **Transient LOS Relaxation**: Periods of transient relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter, rather than an immature LOS, are now understood to predispose infants to GOR.
- **Abdominal Muscle Contraction**: Contraction of abdominal muscles during periods of LOS relaxation may elevate the risk of aspiration.
- **Behavioural**: Distressed infants and children may cry or scream, swallowing air and leading to abdominal distension, which increases the risk of regurgitation and aspiration.
### Risk Factors for Aspiration
- Anxiety
- Inadequate or light anaesthesia
- Gastric distension from bag valve mask ventilation
- Increased intra-abdominal pressure
- Difficult airway management
- Gastrointestinal pathology (e.g., GOR, oesophageal disease)
- Obesity
- Sepsis
- Renal failure
- Preoperative opioid administration
## Strategies to Reduce Aspiration Risk
- There is no evidence that **prokinetics**, **H₂ blockers**, or **proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** reduce aspiration risk in children.
- **Fasting Guidelines**:
	- Children are more prone to gastric stasis, especially after trauma or opioid analgesia, even with minimal trauma.
	- Studies have shown that 49% of children who experienced trauma still had significant gastric aspirates after 8 hours of fasting.
	- Therefore, fasting guidelines cannot be fully relied upon to ensure complete gastric emptying in non-elective cases.
## Classical Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI)
### Steps in Classical RSI
1. **Preoxygenation**
2. **Application of cricoid pressure**
3. **Induction** with a predetermined dose of thiopental and succinylcholine.
4. **Avoidance of positive pressure ventilation**.
5. **Rapid tracheal intubation** with a cuffed tube before cricoid pressure removal.
## Preoxygenation
### Function
- **Increase oxygen reserves** within the lungs by denitrogenation of the functional residual capacity (FRC).
- **Prolong apnoeic period** before hypoxaemia occurs.
- **Measurement of efficacy**: The end-tidal oxygenation fraction (EtO₂) provides an approximation of alveolar oxygenation. An EtO₂ of >0.9 is necessary to ensure full denitrogenation of the lungs.
### Apnoeic Oxygenation and Bulk Flow
#### Apnoeic Oxygenation
- Maintaining a patent airway during apnoea allows oxygen to reach the alveoli via **bulk flow**.
- This mechanism relies on differences between oxygen consumption and CO₂ production rates, as well as their solubility in the blood.
- **CO₂ entry into the alveoli**: 0.12–0.25 ml/kg/min.
- **Oxygen removal from alveoli**:
	- **Paediatric patients**: 4–8 ml/kg/min.
	- **Adults**: 2–3 ml/kg/min.
- Net gas removal from the alveoli causes a decrease in barometric pressure, which drives oxygen flow from the upper airway to the alveoli.
#### Maintenance Techniques
- Oxygen administered via nasal prongs or facemask, in conjunction with maintaining a patent airway, delays desaturation.
- **Positive airway pressure** must be maintained with a tight-fitting mask to reduce atelectasis, especially in children.
	- Children are more prone to **atelectasis** and **hypoxaemia** due to:
		- Reduced FRC.
		- Increased closing volume.
		- Higher respiratory rates.
#### Special Considerations for Infants
- A term baby (1 month old) experiences a threefold faster decline in PaO₂ compared to an adult.
- Infants poorly tolerate apnoea and can desaturate within 100 seconds, even after adequate preoxygenation.
## Cricoid Pressure
- The principle of cricoid pressure is based on aligning the trachea and oesophagus, so that when the cricoid cartilage is depressed, it occludes the oesophagus to prevent aspiration of gastric contents.
### Limitations in Children ("The Bad")
- **Anatomical differences**:
	- The cricoid cartilage is smaller and more cephalad in children, making it harder to locate and apply pressure effectively.
	- Depressing the cricoid cartilage may **decrease lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) tone**, which could increase the risk of aspiration.
	- In children <8 years, 45% show **lateral displacement of the oesophagus** at the level of the cricoid cartilage, compared to 15% in those over 8 years (as seen in neck CT scans).
	- Application of low forces (7.7 N) may compress a child's airway, while higher forces (30 N), as recommended for adults, may worsen the laryngeal view.
### Benefits ("The Good")
- **Prevention of gastric insufflation** during bag mask ventilation. Properly applied cricoid pressure can prevent gastric insufflation at pressures up to 40 cm H₂O in children aged 2 weeks to 8 years.
## Induction
### Drugs
- **Propofol**: Effective at suppressing laryngeal reflexes.
- **Succinylcholine**: Dose of 2 mg/kg. Recovery time to spontaneous ventilation is approximately 4.7 minutes.
- **Rocuronium**: Dose of 1.2 mg/kg. Can be reversed with 16 mg/kg of sugammadex.
- **Atropine for premedication**:
	- Atropine does not significantly reduce the incidence of bradycardia.
	- Not recommended as it does not prevent bradycardia in all children.
### Adult Vs Pediatric Patients with Classical RSI (Practical Challenges)
#### Classical RSI
1. **Preoxygenation**
	- Achieving effective preoxygenation can be difficult in uncooperative children. The limited cooperation often results in minimal oxygen reserve compared to adults.
2. **Administration of Induction Agent**
	- Establishing intravenous (IV) access is often more challenging in children, complicating the administration of induction agents.
3. **Application of Cricoid Pressure**
	- The correct timing of cricoid pressure is challenging to maintain.
	- Cricoid pressure can distort the pediatric airway.
	- There is conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of cricoid pressure in pediatric RSI.
4. **Administration of Neuromuscular Blocking Agent**
	- When using succinylcholine, a larger dose per kilogram of body weight is required compared to adults.
5. **Period of Apnoea with No Positive Pressure Ventilation**
	- Even a brief period of apnoea in children can lead to profound hypoxaemia, necessitating careful management during RSI.
# Controlled Rapid Sequence Induction (cRSI)

Controlled Rapid Sequence Induction (cRSI) offers a structured approach to intubation that is meticulous about maintaining ventilation and preventing aspiration. Here's a detailed breakdown of the cRSI procedure:

1. **NG Tube Management**
   - If a nasogastric (NG) tube is already in situ, continuous aspiration should be maintained.
   - If no NG tube is present, it should be inserted after securing the tracheal tube.
2. **Patient Positioning**
   - During preoxygenation and induction, patients should be positioned with a 20° head-up tilt. This position helps reduce the risk of aspiration and may improve respiratory mechanics.
3. **Induction Agent Titration**
   - The induction agent should be titrated to achieve hypnosis, ensuring the patient is adequately sedated before further steps.
4. **Neuromuscular Blocking Agent Administration**
   - Atracurium at a dose of 1 mg/kg is traditionally used in cRSI, but the choice of neuromuscular blocking agent can vary. The primary goal is to achieve optimal muscle relaxation, which should be monitored via neuromuscular block assessment.
   - Ensure that the selection and dosage of the neuromuscular blocker are appropriate to achieve complete relaxation, guided by neuromuscular monitoring.
5. **Ventilation Pre-Intubation**
   - Gentle bag mask ventilation should be performed with insufflation pressures maintained below 12 cm H₂O. This helps maintain oxygenation while minimizing the risk of gastric insufflation and subsequent aspiration.
6. **Timing of Intubation**
   - Intubation should only proceed once there is no response to a train-of-four stimulus from a nerve stimulator. This confirms a deep level of anesthesia and complete muscle paralysis, minimizing the risk of aspiration and trauma during the intubation process.
