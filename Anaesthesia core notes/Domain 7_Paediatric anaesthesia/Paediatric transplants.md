# Preoperative Assessment for Paediatric Liver Transplantation

- **General Health of the Child:**
	- Document age, weight, and height.
	- Look for signs of liver disease (e.g., bruising, encephalopathy, stigmata).
	- Determine if liver failure is acute or chronic, as this affects complication risks.
- **Underlying Liver Disease:**
	- Identify cause of liver failure (e.g., biliary atresia, metabolic disorders, autoimmune disease).
	- Assess if liver disease is part of a syndrome (e.g., Alagille’s syndrome) with potential cardiac or organ involvement.
- **Renal Function:**
	- Assess for renal dysfunction, which may be multifactorial (e.g., polycystic liver/kidney disease, hepatorenal syndrome).
- **Pulmonary Considerations:**
	- Evaluate for hepatopulmonary or portopulmonary disease leading to hypoxemia or pulmonary hypertension.
	- Obtain a cardiac echo to assess heart function and pulmonary pressures.
- **Cardiovascular Status:**
	- Recognise the hyperdynamic circulation typical of liver disease (increased heart rate, cardiac output, decreased peripheral resistance).
- **Coagulation and Haematologic Status:**
	- Document coagulation profile, platelet count, and history of varices or recent bleeding.
	- Prepare for potential massive blood loss and blood product administration.
- **Prior Surgeries:**
	- Identify previous abdominal surgeries (e.g., Kasai procedure) that may complicate the transplant.
- **Preoperative Medications:**
	- Ensure appropriate immunosuppressants, antifungals, and other medications are in line with the transplant protocol.
- **Investigations:**
	- Obtain laboratory tests: CBC, coagulation profile, electrolytes, liver/renal function.
	- Consider cardiac imaging if pulmonary hypertension is suspected.
	- Prepare the blood bank for potential massive transfusion needs.
- **Premedication and Preparation:**
	- Provide anxiolysis with oral midazolam.
	- Ensure adequate vascular access, invasive monitoring, and sterile technique.
	- Prepare anesthetic drugs, including vasopressors, calcium, and antiarrhythmic agents.
	- Plan for postoperative ventilation and intensive care management.
### Intraoperative Anesthetic Management for Pediatric Liver Transplantation

- **Pre-anhepatic Phase:**
	- Expect significant bleeding; monitor coagulation closely.
	- Maintain adequate urine output with fluids and diuretics.
	- Monitor cardiovascular parameters, as the inferior vena cava may be kinked or compressed.
	- Treat hypoglycemia and electrolyte abnormalities.
- **Anhepatic Phase:**
	- Monitor and treat hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and coagulopathy.
	- Prepare for reperfusion of the new liver (calcium, fluids, blood products).
- **Reperfusion of New Liver:**
	- Anticipate potential complications:
		- Severe hypotension, arrhythmias, air emboli.
		- Bleeding from the raw liver surface.
		- Electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia).
		- Acidosis.
	- Treat aggressively with fluids, blood products, calcium, and other supportive measures.
- **Post-reperfusion Phase:**
	- Continue to monitor and correct coagulopathy, renal function, and electrolytes.
	- Maintain normothermia.
	- Prepare for prolonged postoperative ventilation and intensive care management.
### Surgical Technique Overview

1. **Pre-anhepatic phase:** Extensive dissection to remove the diseased liver.
2. **Anhepatic phase:** Interruption of blood flow, removal of the diseased liver, implantation of the new liver.
3. **Neohepatic phase:** Vascular anastomoses, reperfusion of the new liver, biliary reconstruction.
### Postoperative Management

- **Ventilation and Analgesia:**
	- Postoperative ventilation is typically required due to the large incision, diaphragmatic splinting, and bowel paresis.
	- Provide adequate analgesia, often with morphine infusion.
- **Fluid and Blood Product Management:**
	- Maintain fluid balance, allowing for blood product administration.
	- Infuse fresh frozen plasma in the initial 24-48 hours.
- **Immunosuppression and Antimicrobials:**
	- Continue immunosuppressive medications per the transplant protocol.
	- Provide broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiviral, and antifungal prophylaxis.
- **Monitoring and Support:**
	- Monitor graft function, coagulation, renal status, and electrolytes closely.
	- Maintain inotropic support as needed.
- **Handover to Intensive Care:**
	- Provide a detailed handover to the intensive care team, including any special requirements.
### Considerations for Future Surgeries in Transplanted Patients

- Focus on:
	- Preserving graft function.
	- Managing infection risk.
	- Addressing any other organ dysfunction.

# Anaesthetic and Perioperative Management of Paediatric Organ Recipients in Non-Transplant Surgery

#### Pharmacological Considerations

**Immunosuppressive Drugs:**
- Common drugs:
	- Cyclosporine A
	- Azathioprine
	- Steroids
	- Tacrolimus (FK506) and mycophenolate mofetil (newer alternatives)
- **Side effects:**
	- Neurotoxicity
	- Nephrotoxicity with hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis
	- CNS toxicity, hypertension, diabetes
	- Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia
	- Growth retardation, hirsutism, electrolyte abnormalities
	- Cushingoid features, obesity, pathological fractures
- **Specific complications:**
	- Cyclosporine-induced hypertension is common.
	- Tacrolimus-induced hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is rare but seen in pediatric patients.

**Anaesthetic Drugs:**

- **Inhalational agents:**
	- Halothane is commonly used, but sevoflurane provides a more rapid and smooth induction.
	- Desflurane allows for faster emergence and recovery, though it may be irritating on induction.
- **Intravenous agents and local anesthetics** may also be used.
- **Succinylcholine** may be used, except in renal failure with hyperkalemia.
- **Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants:** Lower doses may be required in cyclosporine users due to prolonged recovery. Suitable agents include:
	- Vecuronium, atracurium, cisatracurium, and mivacurium.
#### Anaesthetic and Perioperative Management

**Preoperative Assessment:**
- Focus on:
	- Transplanted organ function.
	- State of immunosuppression, presence of rejection or infection.
	- Function of other organs.
- Communicate with the transplant team.
- Assess renal function and rule out infections.
- Maintain therapeutic levels of immunosuppressive drugs.
- Provide psychological support and anxiolytic premedication.

**Intraoperative Management:**
- **Anaesthetic approach:** Local, regional, or general anesthesia is safe for transplant recipients.
- **Intubation:** Orotracheal preferred over nasal intubation to reduce infection risk.
- **Monitoring:** Use aseptic techniques for invasive monitoring.
- **Laryngeal mask airway (LMA):** Acceptable, particularly in obese patients with 'steroid face.'

**Postoperative Care:**
- **Analgesics:** Use paracetamol or opioids with attention to side effects.
- **Avoid NSAIDs** due to nephrotoxicity.
- **Postoperative analgesia:** Epidural blocks, wound infiltration, or peripheral nerve blocks are suitable.
#### Specific Anaesthetic Considerations for Transplant Recipients

**Kidney Transplant Recipients:**
- **Avoid drugs** with renal toxicity.
- Maximize preload and avoid hypotension.
- Atracurium and cisatracurium are suitable muscle relaxants.
- Morphine metabolites may accumulate in renal dysfunction, requiring dose titration.

**Liver Transplant Recipients:**
- Higher incidence of surgical complications (e.g., viscus perforation, peritonitis).
- Children with well-functioning liver grafts respond normally to anesthetic agents.
- **Sevoflurane** for induction and **desflurane** or **isoflurane** for maintenance are safe combinations.

**Heart Transplant Recipients:**
- The transplanted heart is **denervated**, with no cardiovascular response to intubation and a slower heart rate.
- Preload dependence is critical; avoid hypovolemia.
- Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dobutamine maintain their positive effects, but **atropine** is ineffective.
- Endomyocardial biopsy is often performed under sedation or general anesthesia.

**Lung and Heart-Lung Transplant Recipients:**
- Lung function improves after transplantation, but complications like **tracheal stenosis** and **obliterative bronchiolitis** can occur.
- **Transbronchial biopsy** is frequently performed under sedation.
- Postoperative care includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and thoracic epidural analgesia.

**Intestinal Transplant Recipients:**
- High morbidity and mortality due to complications like severe infections and rejection.
- **Venous access** may be difficult due to long-term parenteral nutrition use.

**Bone Marrow Transplant Recipients:**
- Decreased hematopoietic reserve can lead to **anemia**, **leukopenia**, and/or **thrombocytopenia**.
- Total body irradiation may cause complications such as **restrictive cardiomyopathy**, **cataracts**, and **hypothyroidism**.
#### Conclusions

- Successful anesthetic and perioperative management of pediatric transplant recipients requires:
	- Understanding the physiology of the transplanted organ.
	- Knowledge of immunosuppressive drugs and associated abnormalities.
	- Tailoring management to the underlying surgical condition.
- A **registry** of perioperative problems in transplanted children undergoing non-transplant surgery is needed to guide future management strategies.
