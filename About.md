My name is Francois Uys, and I am a proud father, husband, and a registrar in the Department of Anaesthesia at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.

Throughout my journey in medicine, I often felt overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources available for studying anaesthesia. It created confusion, anxiety, and the persistent feeling that I could never truly master everything. This experience pushed me to develop something better—a comprehensive, easily accessible resource that brings everything together in one place.

This website is my attempt to create a "go-to" guide that simplifies learning, allowing topics to interconnect in a meaningful way. I chose Obsidian because it mirrors how we naturally think—everything linked, everything connected. With Obsidian, I’ve built a system that not only helps me organize knowledge but also grows and evolves as I continue to learn.

I hope this resource will be a helpful tool, not only for myself but for others who, like me, want to feel more in control of their learning and knowledge in anaesthesia.
