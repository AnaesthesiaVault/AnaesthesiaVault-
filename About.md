ðŸ‘‹ My name is Dr. Francois Uys, and I am specializing anaesthesia in South Africa.

Throughout my journey in medicine, I often found myself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources available for studying anaesthesia. This led to confusion, anxiety, and the constant feeling that I could never master everything. To address this challenge, I created something betterâ€”a comprehensive and easily accessible resource that brings everything together in one place.

âœ¨Â **AnaesthesiaVault**Â is my attempt to develop a "go-to" guide that simplifies learning by allowing topics to interconnect in meaningful ways. I chose Obsidian because it mirrors how we naturally thinkâ€”everything linked, everything connected. As I continue to learn and update my knowledge, this system evolves with me.

I hope this resource will serve as a helpful tool, not only for myself but also for others who seek to take control of their learning and anaesthesia knowledge.

### My Workflow

Hereâ€™s how I build and update AnaesthesiaVault:

1. **Identify Required Topics**  
	I based the topics on the Colleges of Medicine South Africa (CMSA) curriculum and supplemented them where needed.
	
2. **Gather Resources**  
	The notes are built from peer-reviewed and trusted sources, including:
	
	- **Journal Articles**:
		- [BMJ Education](https://www.bjaed.org/)
		- [BMJ Clinical Review](https://www.bmj.com/education/clinical-review)
		- [British Journal of Anaesthesia](https://www.bjanaesthesia.org/)
		- [Current Opinion in Anesthesiology](https://journals.lww.com/co-anesthesiology/pages/default.aspx)
		- [American Society of Anaesthesiology](https://pubs.asahq.org/anesthesiology)
	- **Textbooks**:
		- Oxford Handbook of Anaesthesia (Allman et al.)
		- Morgan and Mikhailâ€™s Clinical Anesthesiology (Butterworth et al.)
		- Basic Physiology for Anaesthetists (Chambers et al.)
		- Miller's Anesthesia (Gropper, Ed.)
		- Data Interpretation in Anesthesia (Raj)
	- **Websites**:
		- [OpenAnaesthesia](https://www.openanesthesia.org/)
		- [FRCA Mind Maps](https://www.frcamindmaps.org/)
		- [Anaesthesia Tutorial of the Week (ATOTW)](https://resources.wfsahq.org/anaesthesia-tutorial-of-the-week/)
		- [The Bottom Line](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/)
		- [Anaesthesia Considerations](https://www.anesthesiaconsiderations.com/)
		- [Calgary Guide](https://calgaryguide.ucalgary.ca/)
		- [Deranged Physiology](https://derangedphysiology.com/main/home)
		- [Cardiothoracic Anaesthesia](https://cardiothoracicanaesthesia.com/)
		- [EEG for Anaesthesia](https://eegforanesthesia.iars.org/)
		- [Geeky Medics](https://geekymedics.com/category/medicine/anaesthetics/)
3. **Highlight Key Information**  
	Using tools likeÂ **Omnivore**Â (read-it-later app) andÂ **Zotero**Â (reference manager), I highlight and export the most critical points from each source toÂ **Obsidian**.
	
4. **Distill Notes**  
	In Obsidian, I distill the notes from the highlighted sections, ensuring the most essential information is captured clearly.
	
5. **Formatting with AI**  
	I created a custom GPT model,Â **AnaesthesiaNoteExpert**, to assist in formatting the notes. The model follows strict instructions to avoid altering information, focusing solely on maintaining a consistent format.
	
6. **Create Mind Maps**  
	I useÂ **Whimsical**, an AI-powered plugin, to generate mind maps for better visual learning and reference.
	
7. **Publish Online**  
	Finally, I publish the notes usingÂ **Obsidian Publish**, making them available to learners and professionals worldwide.
