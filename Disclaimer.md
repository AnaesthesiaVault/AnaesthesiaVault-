The content provided on AnaesthesiaVault is for informational and educational purposes only. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information, sourced from reputable references, I do not take responsibility for any errors, omissions, or potential inaccuracies. All notes were generated from credible sources, then manually read and summarized. AI (ChatGPT) was used to format the notes into a professional structure. Specifically, a custom-trained GPT model, the "Anaesthesia Note Expert," created by me, was employed to assist with formatting. Kindly refer to [About](https://anaesthesiavault.xyz/About) for further details of my workflow.
