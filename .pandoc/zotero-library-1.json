These guidelines are a comprehensive document to support decision making, preparation and practical performance of awake tracheal intubation. We performed a systematic review of the literature seeking all of the available evidence for each element of awake tracheal intubation in order to make recommendations. In the absence of high-quality evidence, expert consensus and a Delphi study were used to formulate recommendations. We highlight key areas of awake tracheal intubation in which speciﬁc recommendations were made, which included: indications; procedural setup; checklists; oxygenation; airway topicalisation; sedation; veriﬁcation of tracheal tube position; complications; management of unsuccessful awake tracheal intubation; post-tracheal intubation management; consent; and training. We recognise that there are a range of techniques and regimens that may be effective and one such example technique is included. Breaking down the key practical elements of awake tracheal intubation into sedation, topicalisation, oxygenation and performance might help practitioners to plan, perform and address complications. These guidelines aim to support clinical practice and help lower the threshold for performing awake tracheal intubation when indicated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahmad","given":"I."},{"family":"El‐Boghdadly","given":"K."},{"family":"Bhagrath","given":"R."},{"family":"Hodzovic","given":"I."},{"family":"McNarry","given":"A.

  {"id":"Alaali.Irwin_Anaesthesiaurological_2015","abstract":"Anaesthesia is commonly used to facilitate urological procedures and many patients are elderly with multiple co-morbidities. Urological procedures range from minor day case to major surgery in which extensive resources are needed both intra- and postoperatively. For simple day case procedures like cystoscopy or ureteroscopy, general anaesthesia is most commonly used because it allows for early ambulation. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) needs special attention. TURP syndrome due to excessive absorption of the irrigation ﬂuid can be catastrophic if not managed early. Avoiding contributing factors and choosing regional anaesthesia which allows for early detection are key. Careful perioperative planning and risk stratiﬁcation is important in major urological cancer surgery. Most of these procedures will require general anaesthesia (due to longer operative time and more extensive surgical trauma). Postoperative pain management in the form of epidural or patient-controlled multimodal analgesia are essential. Postoperative high-dependency care is beneﬁcial.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Alaali","given":"Hazem H."},{"family":"Irwin","given":"Michael G."}],"citation-key":"Alaali.Irwin_Anaesthesiaurological_2015","container-title":"Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine","container-title-short":"Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.mpaic.2015.03.004","ISSN":"14720299","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6]]},"language":"en","page":"300-304","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Anaesthesia for urological surgery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1472029915000648","volume":"16"},

The objective of this quantitative systematic review is to evaluate whether or not the peri-operative administration of intravenous magnesium can reduce postoperative pain. Twenty-ﬁve trials comparing magnesium with placebo were identiﬁed. Independent of the mode of administration (bolus or continuous infusion), peri-operative magnesium reduced cumulative intravenous morphine consumption by 24.4% (mean difference: 7.6 mg, 95% CI )9.5 to )5.8 mg; p < 0.00001) at 24 h postoperatively.

  {"id":"Anderson.etal_Registrybasedtrials_2020","abstract":"Background/Aims: Registry-based trials have emerged as a potentially cost-saving study methodology. Early estimates of cost savings, however, conflated the benefits associated with registry utilisation and those associated with other aspects of pragmatic trial designs, which might not all be as broadly applicable. In this study, we sought to build a practical tool that investigators could use across disciplines to estimate the ranges of potential cost differences associated with implementing registry-based trials versus standard clinical trials. Methods: We built simulation Markov models to compare unique costs associated with data acquisition, cleaning, and linkage under a registry-based trial design versus a standard clinical trial. We conducted one-way, twoway, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, varying study characteristics over broad ranges, to determine thresholds at which investigators might optimally select each trial design. Results: Registry-based trials were more cost effective than standard clinical trials 98.6% of the time. Data-related cost savings ranged from $4300 to $600,000 with variation in study characteristics. Cost differences were most reactive to the number of patients in a study, the number of data elements per patient available in a registry, and the speed with which research coordinators could manually abstract data. Registry incorporation resulted in cost savings when as few as 3768 independent data elements were available and when manual data abstraction took as little as 3.4 seconds per data field. Conclusions: Registries offer important resources for investigators. When available, their broad incorporation may help the scientific community reduce the costs of clinical investigation. We offer here a practical tool for investigators to assess potential costs savings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Brett R."},{"family":"Gotlieb","given":"Evelyn G."},{"family":"Hill","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"McHugh","given":"Kimberly E."},{"family":"Scheurer","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Mery","given":"Carlos M."},{"family":"Pelletier","given":"Glenn J."},{"family":"Kaltman","given":"Jonathan R."},{"family":"White","given":"Owen J."},{"family":"Trachtenberg","given":"Felicia L."},{"family":"Hollenbeck-Pringle","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"McCrindle","given":"Brian W."},{"family":"Sylvester","given":"Donna M."},{"family":"Eckhauser","given":"Aaron W."},{"family":"Pasquali","given":"Sara K."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Jeffery B."},{"family":"Schamberger","given":"Marcus S."},{"family":"Shashidharan","given":"Subhadra"},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Jeffrey P."},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Marshall L."},{"family":"Boskovski","given":"Marko"},{"family":"Newburger","given":"Jane W."},{"family":"Nathan","given":"Meena"}],"citation-key":"Anderson.etal_Registrybasedtrials_2020","container-title":"Cardiology in the Young","container-title-short":"Cardiol Young","DOI":"10.1017/S1047951120001018","ISSN":"1047-9511, 1467-1107","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6]]},"language":"en","page":"807-817","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Registry-based trials: a potential model for cost savings?","title-short":"Registry-based trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1047951120001018/type/journal_article","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"Andruszkiewicz.etal_Reliabilityfocused_2015","abstract":"Background: Use of preoperative echocardiography may help to identify patients with increased cardiac risk, who may benefit from modification of perioperative plan. The objective of our study was to evaluate the reliability of preoperative focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) performed by an anaesthetist with basic ultrasound training and its impact on patient’s management.\nMethods: The prospective observational study was conducted in 159 adult patients, scheduled for elective operations. Cardiac ultrasound was performed by one anaesthetist with a limited experience of FoCUS. A simple, mnemonic scheme was used for the final reporting of each study. The same scheme was used by a cardiologist who produced an independent report based on digital video loops stored in the machine memory. Anaesthetists in-charge made final perioperative plan. Comparative analysis of anaesthetist and cardiologist performed ultrasound report was made. The incidence of modification of initial perioperative plan resulting from FoCUS report was analyzed.\nResults: The average time required to complete the examination was 182 s 95 % CI [173–190]. Images of quality adequate to answer all questions from the scheme were obtained in 97.5 % (155/159) of patients. There was strong agreement between the anaesthetist and the cardiologist in 97.8 % (2274/2325) of the examined categories. In two categories (global and regional left ventricle contractility impairment) statistically significant discrepancies between both diagnosticians were confirmed (p McNemar <0.04). When compared with the cardiologist’s assessment the agreement of the anesthetist’s diagnosis had sensitivity of 0.84, specificity 0.99, positive predictive value 0.78 and negative predictive value 0.99. Kappa statistics showed good agreement between both examining doctors (κ = 0.797). Based on ultrasound findings, the preliminary anaesthetic plan was changed in relation to 20.8 % (33/159) of patients.\nConclusions: An anaesthetist with limited training in FoCUS can perform a reliable preoperative examination which alters the perioperative management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Andruszkiewicz","given":"Pawel"},{"family":"Sobczyk","given":"Dorota"},{"family":"Gorkiewicz-Kot","given":"Izabela"},{"family":"Kowalik","given":"Ilona"},{"family":"Gelo","given":"Remigiusz"},{"family":"Stach","given":"Orest"}],"citation-key":"Andruszkiewicz.etal_Reliabilityfocused_2015","container-title":"Cardiovascular Ultrasound","container-title-short":"Cardiovasc Ultrasound","DOI":"10.1186/s12947-015-0039-y","ISSN":"1476-7120","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12]]},"language":"en","page":"45","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Reliability of focused cardiac ultrasound by novice sonographer in preoperative anaesthetic assessment: an observational study","title-short":"Reliability of focused cardiac ultrasound by novice sonographer in preoperative anaesthetic assessment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cardiovascularultrasound.com/content/13/1/45","volume":"13"},

Collected data are used for quality assurance, quality development, and serve as a basis for research projects. Study population: The DAD was founded in 2004 as a part of Danish Clinical Registries (Regionernes Kliniske Kvalitetsudviklings Program [RKKP]). Patients undergoing general anesthesia, regional anesthesia with or without combined general anesthesia as well as patients under sedation are registered. Data are retrieved from public and private anesthesia clinics, single-centers as well as multihospital corporations across Denmark. In 2014 a total of 278,679 unique entries representing a national coverage of ∼70% were recorded, data completeness is steadily increasing. Main variable: Records are aggregated for determining 13 defined quality indicators and eleven defined complications all covering the anesthetic process from the preoperative assessment through anesthesia and surgery until the end of the postoperative recovery period. Descriptive data: Registered variables include patients’ individual social security number (assigned to all Danes) and both direct patient-related lifestyle factors enabling a quantification of patients’ comorbidity as well as variables that are strictly related to the type, duration, and safety of the anesthesia. Data and specific data combinations can be extracted within each department in order to monitor patient treatment. In addition, an annual DAD report is a benchmark for departments nationwide. Conclusion: The DAD is covering the anesthetic process for the majority of patients undergoing anesthesia in Denmark. Data in the DAD are increasingly used for both quality and research projects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Antonsen","given":"Kristian"},{"family":"Rosenstock","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Hyldborg Lundstrom","given":"Lars"}],"citation-key":"Antonsen.etal_DanishAnaesthesia_2016","container-title":"Clinical Epidemiology","container-title-short":"CLEP","DOI":"10.2147/CLEP.S99517","ISSN":"1179-1349","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10]]},"language":"en","page":"435-438","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Danish Anaesthesia Database","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.dovepress.com/the-danish-anaesthesia-database-peer-reviewed-article-CLEP","volume":"Volume 8"},

  {"id":"Baeriswyl.etal_AnalgesicEfficacy_2015a","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Previous meta-analyses of the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block have examined a maximum of 12 articles, including fewer than 650 participants, and have not examined the effect of ultrasound-guided techniques specifically. Recently, many trials that use ultrasound approaches to TAP block have been published, which report conflicting analgesic results. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided TAP blocks exclusively for all types of abdominal surgeries in adult patients.\nMETHODS: This meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. The primary outcome was cumulative IV morphine consumption at 6 hours postoperatively, analyzed according to the type of surgery, the type of surgical anesthesia, the timing of injection, the block approach adopted, and the presence of postoperative multimodal analgesia. Secondary outcomes included IV morphine consumption at 24 hours postoperatively; pain scores at rest and on movement at 6 and 24 hours postoperatively; and postoperative nausea and vomiting, pruritus, and rates of complications.\nRESULTS: Thirty-one controlled trials including 1611 adult participants were identified. Independent of the type of surgery (abdominal laparotomy, abdominal laparoscopy, and cesarean delivery) but not independent of the type of surgical anesthesia (general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia with or without intrathecal long-acting opioid), ultrasound-guided TAP block reduced IV morphine consumption at 6 hours postoperatively by a mean difference of 6 mg (95% confidence interval [CI], −7 to −4 mg; I2 = 94%; P < 0.00001). The magnitude of the reduction in morphine consumption at 6 hours postoperatively was not influenced by the timing of injection (I2 = 0%; P = 0.72), the block approach adopted (I2 = 0%; P = 0.72), or the presence of postoperative multimodal analgesia (I2 = 73%; P = 0.05). This difference persisted at 24 hours postoperatively (mean difference, −11 mg; 95% CI, −14 to −8 mg; I2 = 99%; P < 0.00001). Pain scores at rest and on movement were reduced at 6 hours postoperatively (mean difference at rest, −10; 95% CI, −15 to −5; I2 = 92%; P = 0.0002; mean difference on movement, −9; 95% CI, −14 to −5; I2 = 58%; P < 0.00001). There were neither differences in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (I2 = 1%; P = 0.59) nor in the pruritus (I2 = 12%; P = 0.58) Two minor complications (1 bruise and 1 anaphylactoid reaction) were reported in 1028 patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided TAP block provides marginal postoperative analgesic ­efficacy after abdominal laparotomy or laparoscopy and cesarean delivery. However, it does not provide additional analgesic effect in patients who also received spinal anesthesia containing a long-acting opioid. The minimal analgesic efficacy is independent of the timing of injection, the approach adopted, or the presence of postoperative multimodal analgesia. Because of heterogeneity of the results, these findings should be interpreted with caution.  (Anesth Analg 2015;121:1640–54)","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Baeriswyl","given":"Moira"},{"family":"Kirkham","given":"Kyle R."},{"family":"Kern","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Albrecht","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"Baeriswyl.etal_AnalgesicEfficacy_2015a","container-title":"Anesthesia & Analgesia","DOI":"10.1213/ANE.0000000000000967","ISSN":"0003-2999","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1640-1654","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Analgesic Efficacy of Ultrasound-Guided Transversus Abdominis Plane Block in Adult Patients: A Meta-Analysis","title-short":"The Analgesic Efficacy of Ultrasound-Guided Transversus Abdominis Plane Block in Adult Patients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/00000539-201512000-00038","volume":"121"},

The results show that 83.8% of the patients’ management was impacted on by echocardiography. Valvular lesions were the main indication. The most frequent contribution was information provided towards the diagnosis of heart failure and assessment after myocardial infarction. Of the echocardiograms, 56.2% confirmed the referring doctor’s diagnosis, yet were still associated with a significant impact. The rational prescription of medication had the major impetus, followed by de-escalation of therapy and screening patients to determine referral to a tertiary facility.\nConclusion. ECHO has a positive impact on patient management outside tertiary settings, where the definition of impact appears to be different. The value of a normal study, screening prior to upstream referral and usefulness irrespective of change have been established. This should alert policy makers against restriction of access to ECHO and promote training of personnel in its use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Bedeker","given":"W F"},{"family":"Lachman","given":"A S"},{"family":"Borkum","given":"M"},{"family":"Hellenberg","given":"D"},{"family":"Cupido","given":"C S"}],"citation-key":"Bedeker.etal_Impacttransthoracic_2015","container-title":"South African Medical Journal","container-title-short":"S Afr Med J","DOI":"10.7196/SAMJnew.8102","ISSN":"2078-5135","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,19]]},"language":"en","page":"817","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Impact of transthoracic echocardiography at district hospital level","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.samj.org.za/index.php/samj/article/view/9826","volume":"105"},

  {"id":"Bishop.etal_Obstetricspinal_2017","abstract":"Background. Obstetric spinal hypotension is a common and important problem during caesarean delivery. Identifying patients at risk for hypotension may guide clinical decision-making and allow timeous referral.\nObjective. Using preoperative risk factors, to develop a simple scoring system to predict systolic hypotension.\nMethods. This prospective, single-centre, observational study of patients undergoing elective or urgent caesarean delivery assessed body mass index, baseline heart rate, baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP), maternal age, urgency of surgery (elective v. non-elective) and preoperative haemoglobin concentration as predictors of spinal hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg). We used empirical cut-point estimations in a logistic regression model to develop a scoring system for prediction of hypotension.\nResults. From 504 eligible patients, preoperative heart rate (odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 - 1.03; p=0.012), preoperative MAP (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95 - 0.98; p<0.001) and maternal age (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.08; p=0.002) were found to be predictors of hypotension. We derived a preliminary scoring system (pulse rate >90 bpm, age >25 years, MAP <90 mmHg – the PRAM score) for the prediction of systolic hypotension following obstetric spinal anaesthesia. Patients with three factors had a 53% chance of developing hypotension, compared with the overall incidence of 30%. The PRAM score showed good discrimination, with a c-statistic of 0.626 (95% CI 0.576 - 0.676) and good calibration.\nConclusions. Preoperative heart rate, preoperative MAP and maternal age were predictive of hypotension in elective and emergency caesarean delivery. The PRAM score shows promise as a simple, practical means to identify these patients preoperatively, but requires prospective validation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bishop","given":"D G"},{"family":"Cairns","given":"C"},{"family":"Grobbelaar","given":"M"},{"family":"Rodseth","given":"R N"}],"citation-key":"Bishop.etal_Obstetricspinal_2017","container-title":"South African Medical Journal","container-title-short":"S Afr Med J","DOI":"10.7196/SAMJ.2017.v107i12.12390","ISSN":"2078-5135, 0256-9574","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,27]]},"language":"en","page":"1127","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Obstetric spinal hypotension","title-short":"Obstetric spinal hypotension","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.samj.org.za/index.php/samj/article/view/12137","volume":"107"},
  {"id":"Bithal_Neuromonitoring_2014","abstract":"Intra‑operative neurophysiologic monitoring (IONM) under anaesthesia has achieved popularity because it helps prevent/ minimize neurologic morbidity from surgical manipulations of various neurologic structures. Neurologic functions in an anaesthetised patient can be monitored either by electroencephalography (EEG) or by evoked potentials. Whereas, EEG is difficult to analyse, evoked potentials, in contrast, are easy to interpret, they are either present or absent, delayed or not delayed, with normal or abnormal wave. The goal of IONM is to identify changes in nervous system function prior to irreversible damage. Many factors need consideration when selecting an anaesthetic regimen for intra‑operative monitoring of evoked potentials. The very pathophysiological condition or the potential risks of the contemplated surgical procedure, which require evoked potentials monitoring, may place constraints on anaesthetic management as well. With the availability of numerous anaesthetic techniques, an appropriate plan for managing both anaesthesia and IONM in a patient should be organised. It is extremely essential not to alter the pharmacological state of the patient to avoid any changes in the recording of evoked responses.While an anaesthesiologist may alter plans for a patient in order to facilitate IONM, monitoring team too, sometimes may be required to modify plans for monitoring when a particular anaesthetic agent or technique is strongly indicated or contraindicated. At times, compromise may be required between an anaesthesia technique and a monitoring technique. To serve patients’ best interest, it is critical to have a team approach and good communication among the neurophysiologist, anaesthesiologist and surgeon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bithal","given":"Parmod"}],"citation-key":"Bithal_Neuromonitoring_2014","container-title":"Journal of Neuroanaesthesiology and Critical Care","container-title-short":"Journal of Neuroanaesthesiology and Critical Care","DOI":"10.4103/2348-0548.124832","ISSN":"2348-0548, 2348-926X","issue":"01","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4]]},"language":"en","page":"002-012","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neuromonitoring","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.4103/2348-0548.124832","volume":"01"},

  {"id":"C.etal_Thyroid_Paeds_2012","abstract":"Surgical diseases of the thyroid in the pediatric population represent a diverse set of both benign and malignant conditions. Overall, incidence is rare. Benign conditions include Graves’ disease, toxic adenomas, congenital hyperthyroidism, and goiter. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), with its related familial cancer syndromes, are the most common malignancies. Near-total or total thyroidectomy is the appropriate surgery for thyroid cancer, with/out central lymph node dissection. Emerging practice guidelines from professional societies are helpful, although they generally have not addressed surgical management of the pediatric patient. Thyroidectomy in children is associated with a higher rate of complications, such as recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypoparathyroidism, as compared to the surgery in adults. Therefore, it is essential that pediatric thyroidectomy be performed by high-volume thyroid surgeons, regardless of specialty. Case volume to support surgical expertise usually must be borrowed from the adult experience, given the relative paucity of pediatric thyroidectomies at an institutional level. These surgeons should work as part of a multidisciplinary team that includes pediatric endocrinologists and anesthesiologists, pediatricians, nuclear medicine physicians, and pathologists to afford children the best clinical outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"C","given":"Breuer"},{"family":"C","given":"Tuggle"},{"family":"D","given":"Solomon"},{"family":"Ja","given":"Sosa"}],"citation-key":"C.etal_Thyroid_Paeds_2012","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology","container-title-short":"Jcrpe","DOI":"10.4274/jcrpe.817","ISSN":"13085727","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,15]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Thyroid_Paeds","title-short":"Pediatric Thyroid Disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://cms.galenos.com.tr/Uploads/Article_6473/79-85.pdf","volume":"4"},

There is increasing evidence that anesthetic technique has the potential to affect long-term outcome after cancer surgery.\nMethods: This work reviews the English published literature that was obtained by performing a search of the PubMed database up to January 2014. We selected articles that provided evidence or reviewed the possible actions of anesthetics on cancer cells or the influence of anesthesia in recurrence/outcome.\nResults: Inhaled anesthetics induce immunosuppression and activate inflammatory cascade activation, whereas propofol has a protective action. Opioids might promote cancer recurrence and metastasis. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that local anesthetics inhibit proliferation and migration of cancer cells and induce apoptosis.\nConclusions: Anesthesiologists should follow current best clinical practice and include all strategies that effectively decrease pain and attenuate stress. Regional anesthesia and multimodal analgesia, adding antiinflammatory drugs, play an unquestionable role in the control of perioperative pain and may improve recurrence-free survival.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Cassinello","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Prieto","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Del Olmo","given":"Mercedes"},{"family":"Rivas","given":"Sonia"},{"family":"Strichartz","given":"Gary R."}],"citation-key":"Cassinello.etal_CancerAnaesthesia_2015","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Anesthesia","container-title-short":"Journal of Clinical Anesthesia","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclinane.2015.02.007","ISSN":"09528180","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5]]},"language":"en","page":"262-272","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cancer Anaesthesia","title-short":"Cancer surgery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0952818015000549","volume":"27"},

Body water content, plasma electrolyte composition and plasma pH are all under the regulatory control of the kidney. In addition, the kidney provides a path of excretion for blood-borne, water-soluble, low-molecularweight compounds. These include the end-products of protein metabolism, such as urea and creatinine, as well as foreign compounds with similar physicochemical characteristics and their metabolites. Endocrine activity of the human kidney includes the secretion of the hormones erythropoietin and renin and the activation of vitamin D by hydroxylation to its 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol form. The renal blood ﬂow is immense, constituting 20e25% of resting cardiac output. The glomeruli form 170e200 litres of ultraﬁltrate per day and the selective reabsorption of water and solutes results in the ﬁnal formation of approximately 1.5 litres of urine. Here, commonly used laboratory tests of renal function are discussed, including glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), creatinine clearance, serum creatinine concentration estimation of GFR, serum urea concentration, novel measures of renal function, emerging biomarkers for acute kidney injury, urinalysis, free water clearance and endocrine changes in renal disease.

We describe here, the experience from an Australian tertiary pediatric center that has continued an active pediatric renal transplantation program after relocation in 1995. Areas of interest include preoperative status, fluid management, hemodynamic stability, perioperative complications, and the use of epidural analgesia. In particular, the influence of perioperative epidural analgesia on hemodynamic stability is addressed.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              : A retrospective review of anesthesia records of all patients undergoing pediatric renal transplantation performed at the Children's Hospital at Westmead (CHW), from November 1995 to October 2002 was carried out.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              : Fifty‐three pediatric renal transplants were performed in 50 patients. Average age and weight were 10.2 years (range: 1–18 years) and 31.4 kg (range: 9–66 kg), respectively. A total of 14 recipients were less than or equal to 6 years of age. Twenty‐four children were recipients of cadaveric transplants, 29 children received kidneys from living related donors. Few children presented with severe anemia (two patients) gross electrolyte abnormalities (three patients) or uncontrolled hypertension. Intraoperatively, all children had central venous pressure monitoring and only four had invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring. Average intraoperative fluid administration was 88 ml·kg\n              −1\n              (range: 30–190). Twenty‐three children received blood transfusions intraoperatively. Postoperative analgesia was provided using an epidural infusion in 39 patients and an opioid infusion/patient controlled analgesia in the remainder. There was a tendency to greater hemodynamic stability in the group, which received intra‐operative epidural analgesia. Half the patients who had epidural analgesia required parenteral opioid supplementation. Five patients had postoperative pulmonary edema. Minor postoperative adverse events included epidural associated motor block (three cases) and opioid related oversedation (one patient).

The visual display of the anaesthetic record using the software program Monitor showed substantial rises in end-tidal carbon dioxide levels and allowed calculation of the carbon dioxide elimination, which increased two- to three-fold above normal levels. Having a visual record of carbon dioxide changes facilitated the recognition of surgical emphysema in three out of the four cases. Strategies such as estimating and tracking changes in carbon dioxide elimination from the minute ventilation and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels may assist in early identification, and palpating for surgical emphysema is recommended during laparoscopy if other causes of increased carbon dioxide levels are excluded.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Critchley","given":"L.

  {"id":"Curbelo.etal_Databasesregisters_2014","abstract":"There are many misunderstandings about databases. Database is a commonly misused term in reference to any set of data entered into a computer. However, true databases serve a main purpose, organising data. They do so by establishing several layers of relationships; databases are hierarchical. Databases commonly organise data over different levels and over time, where time can be measured as the time between visits, or between treatments, or adverse events, etc. In this sense, medical databases are closely related to longitudinal observational studies, as databases allow the introduction of data on the same patient over time. Basically, we could establish four types of databases in medicine, depending on their purpose: (1) administrative databases, (2) clinical databases, (3) registers, and (4) study-oriented databases. But a database is a useful tool for a large variety of studies, not a type of study itself. Different types of databases serve very different purposes, and a clear understanding of the different research designs mentioned in this paper would prevent many of the databases we launch from being just a lot of work and very little science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Curbelo","given":"Rafael J."},{"family":"Loza","given":"Estíbaliz"},{"family":"Yébenes","given":"Maria Jesús García","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Carmona","given":"Loreto"}],"citation-key":"Curbelo.etal_Databasesregisters_2014","container-title":"Rheumatology International","container-title-short":"Rheumatol Int","DOI":"10.1007/s00296-014-2954-x","ISSN":"0172-8172, 1437-160X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4]]},"language":"en","page":"447-452","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Databases and registers: useful tools for research, no studies","title-short":"Databases and registers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00296-014-2954-x","volume":"34"},

Coding is used to analyze the data and results are presented by using descriptive statistics. Most of the theses were found to include a few lines of information on population and sample, and a few presented the characteristics of the sample in detailed tables, though without any information on the selection criteria were given. Randomization in random sampling, which is frequently used, was usually limited to unbiased assignment of two classes out of four within a school. No attention was paid to the appropriateness of the sample size and to the analysis techniques employed. Effect size was calculated in only one dissertation, but was not taken into account in the identification of the sample size. Normality tests also indicated some challenges.

  {"id":"Dennis_Transthoracicechocardiography_2011","abstract":"Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a powerful non-invasive diagnostic, monitoring and measurement device in medicine. In addition to cardiologists, many other specialised groups, including emergency and critical care physicians and cardiac anaesthetists, have recognised its ability to provide high quality information and utilise TTE in the care of their patients. In obstetric anaesthesia and management of obstetric critical illness, the favourable characteristics of pregnant women facilitate TTE examination. These include anterior and left lateral displacement of the heart, frequent employment of the left lateral tilted position to avoid aortocaval compression, spontaneous ventilation and wide acceptance of ultrasound technology by women. Of relevance to obstetric anaesthetists is that maternal morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease is signiﬁcant worldwide. This makes TTE an appropriate, important and applicable device in pregnant women. Clinician-performed TTE enables differentiation between the life-threatening causes of hypotension. In the critically ill woman this improves diagnostic accuracy and allows treatment interventions to be instituted and monitored at the point of patient care. This article outlines the application of TTE in the specialty of obstetric anaesthesia and in the management of obstetric critical illness. It describes the importance of TTE education, quality assurance and outcome recording. It also discusses how barriers to the routine implementation of TTE in obstetric anaesthesia and management of obstetric critical illness can be overcome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Dennis","given":"A.T."}],"citation-key":"Dennis_Transthoracicechocardiography_2011","container-title":"International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia","container-title-short":"International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijoa.2010.11.007","ISSN":"0959289X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",4]]},"language":"en","page":"160-168","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transthoracic echocardiography in obstetric anaesthesia and obstetric critical illness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959289X10001901","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"Dhar.Malik_Lasersurgery_2011","abstract":"Laser microlarynygeal surgery poses critical challenges to the anesthesiologist which is compounded further by the ever-growing indications for laser surgery. Lasers are powerful tools in the surgical armamentarium and this power can be dangerous if they are used without checks and controls. Problems include the conﬂicting needs of the surgeon and the anesthesiologist for access of the airway, ﬁre hazards associated with the laser beams, the absolute necessity to ensure the adequacy of ventilation and the intense cardiovascular pressor response to sustained laryngoscopy. Operating room ﬁres are rare but can be devastating. Every conceivable mode of airway management and ventilation has been used for laser surgery of the airway. All techniques have their advantages and drawbacks, which are dependent on the basic airway disease and the degree of airway compromise. The scope of laser surgery under local anesthesia and monitored anesthesia care is expanding everyday as improvements in instrumentation using ﬁbreoptic scopes are ongoing. Sedation in these patients is challenging in itself. On the other hand, robotics has taken complex airway surgery to another level with the requirement of airway management for long periods of time. Many authors have preferred using total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) to inhalational anesthetics. Laser surgery is fraught with dangers not only for the patient but for the operating room personnel as well. Because of which, the use of class 3 and 4 lasers (most surgical lasers) should be under supervision of a laser safety ofﬁcer and performed in speciﬁed areas with all staff educated about the safety drills and protocols.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Dhar","given":"Purnima"},{"family":"Malik","given":"Ashish"}],"citation-key":"Dhar.Malik_Lasersurgery_2011","container-title":"Trends in Anaesthesia and Critical Care","container-title-short":"Trends in Anaesthesia and Critical Care","DOI":"10.1016/j.tacc.2011.01.011","ISSN":"22108440","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",4]]},"language":"en","page":"60-66","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Laser surgery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2210844011000128","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"Doherty.etal_Pediatriclaryngoscopes_2009","abstract":"This review summarizes the evolution of the pediatric laryngoscope using some of the established landmarks in the history of anesthesia. Children were rarely intubated before 1940 though the subsequent 30 years saw a proliferation of pediatric laryngoscopes in part driven by the developments in pediatric anesthesia and surgery, manufacturing techniques and materials and a change in airway management philosophy exempliﬁed by Jackson Rees’s argument against the notion that intubation was to be avoided in children. A perspective on the present day describes the modiﬁcations to popular straight and curved blade laryngoscopes and the development of new devices that enhance direct visualization of the larynx. There are an everincreasing number of laryngoscope devices that assist in indirect visualization of the larynx such as rigid optical stylets and ﬂexible ﬁber-optic scopes. Images from many of these devices may be enhanced by digital camera or real-time video technology. The prospect of future laryngoscope development is glimpsed in the arrival of light emitting diode light source technology and questions remain regarding the consequences of equipment disposability and at the ﬁdelity of disposable equipment manufacture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Doherty","given":"Jane S."},{"family":"Froom","given":"Stephen R."},{"family":"Gildersleve","given":"Christopher D."}],"citation-key":"Doherty.etal_Pediatriclaryngoscopes_2009","container-title":"Pediatric Anesthesia","container-title-short":"Pediatric Anesthesia","DOI":"10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03001.x","ISSN":"1155-5645, 1460-9592","issue":"s1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",7]]},"language":"en","page":"30-37","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pediatric laryngoscopes and intubation aids old and new","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03001.x","volume":"19"},

Lung transplantation is deﬁnitive therapy for end-stage lung disease with indications categorized as suppurative, obstructive, restrictive and pulmonary vascular. Surgical options include single lung, bilateral sequential single lung, and heart lung transplantation. All have their own intraoperative challenges, especially at induction, commencement of positive pressure ventilation, one lung ventilation, pulmonary artery clamping and lung reperfusion. A double lumen tube and a period of one lung ventilation is generally required for cases performed without cardiopulmonary bypass. Strategies to reduce pulmonary pressures and support right ventricular dysfunction are important. Perioperative ﬂuids are minimized and lung protective strategies implemented to optimize lung function. Thoracic epidural anaesthesia is commonly used for postoperative pain management. The most common indication for heart transplantation is non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (55%). Left ventricular assist devices are often used as a bridge to transplantation. Communication between donor and recipient teams is critical. Reversal of anticoagulation and alteration of settings of implanted medical devices may be necessary. Anaesthetic management requires invasive monitoring, optimization of ventricular function and preparation for coagulopathy. Right ventricular dysfunction is the cause of early mortality in 20% of recipients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Durkin","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Buckland","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"Durkin.Buckland_Cardiopulmonarytransplantation_2015","container-title":"Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine","container-title-short":"Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.mpaic.2015.04.010","ISSN":"14720299","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7]]},"language":"en","page":"324-327","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cardiopulmonary transplantation: anaesthetic implications","title-short":"Cardiopulmonary transplantation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1472029915000934","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"Frykholm.etal_Preoperativefasting_2018","abstract":"The current guidelines for preoperative fasting recommend intervals of 6, 4, and 2 h (6e4e2) of fasting for solids, breast milk, and clear ﬂuids, respectively. The objective is to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, but also to prevent unnecessarily long fasting intervals. Pulmonary aspiration is rare and associated with nearly no mortality in paediatric anaesthesia. The incidence may have decreased during the last decades, judging from several audits published recently. However, several reports of very long fasting intervals have also been published, in spite of the implementation of the 6e4e2 fasting regimens. In this review, we examine the physiological basis for various fasting recommendations, the temporal relationship between ﬂuid intake and residual gastric content, and the pathophysiological effects of preoperative fasting, and review recent publications of various attempts to reduce the incidence of prolonged fasting in children. The pros and cons of the current guidelines will be addressed, and possible strategies for a future revision will be suggested.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Frykholm","given":"P."},{"family":"Schindler","given":"E."},{"family":"Sümpelmann","given":"R."},{"family":"Walker","given":"R."},{"family":"Weiss","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Frykholm.etal_Preoperativefasting_2018","container-title":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","container-title-short":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","DOI":"10.1016/j.bja.2017.11.080","ISSN":"00070912","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3]]},"language":"en","page":"469-474","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Preoperative fasting in children: review of existing guidelines and recent developments","title-short":"Preoperative fasting in children","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0007091217540751","volume":"120"},

The principal causes of non-vascular sources of haemostatic perioperative bleeding are a preexisting undetected bleeding disorder, the nature of the operation itself, or acquired coagulation abnormalities secondary to haemorrhage, haemodilution, or haemostatic factor consumption. In the bleeding patient, standard therapeutic approaches include allogeneic blood product administration, concomitant pharmacologic agents, and increasing application of puriﬁed and recombinant haemostatic factors. Multiple haemostatic changes occur perioperatively after trauma and complex surgical procedures including cardiac surgery and liver transplantation. Novel strategies for both prophylaxis and therapy of perioperative bleeding include tranexamic acid, desmopressin, ﬁbrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates. Point-of-care patient testing using thromboelastography, rotational thromboelastometry, and platelet function assays has allowed for more detailed assessment of speciﬁc targeted therapy for haemostasis. Strategic multimodal management is needed to improve management, reduce allogeneic blood product administration, and minimize associated risks related to transfusion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Ghadimi","given":"K"},{"family":"Levy","given":"J.H."},{"family":"Welsby","given":"I.J."}],"citation-key":"Ghadimi.etal_Managementbleeding_2016","container-title":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","container-title-short":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","DOI":"10.1093/bja/aew358","ISSN":"00070912","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"language":"en","page":"iii18-iii30","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Management of the bleeding patient","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0007091217301344","volume":"117"},

Despite recent widespread adoption among physicians, there is limited data on the optimal training methods for teaching FoCUS and metrics for determining competency. We conducted a systematic review to gain insight on the optimal training strategies, including type and duration, that would allow physicians to achieve basic competency in FoCUS.\nMethods: Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to June 2020. Included studies described standardized training programs for at least 5 medical students or physicians on adult FoCUS, followed by an assessment of competency relative to an expert. Data were extracted, and bias was assessed for each study.\nResults: Data were extracted from 23 studies on 292 learners. Existing FoCUS training programs remain varied in duration and type of training. Learners achieved near perfect agreement (κ > 0.8) with expert echocardiographers on detecting left ventricular systolic dysfunction and pericardial effusion with 6 h each of didactics and hands-on training. Substantial agreement (κ > 0.6) on could be achieved in half this time.\nConclusion: A short training program will allow most learners to achieve competency in detecting left ventricular systolic dysfunction and pericardial effusion by FoCUS. Additional training is necessary to ensure skill retention, improve efficiency in image acquisition, and detect other pathologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Gibson","given":"Lauren E."},{"family":"White-Dzuro","given":"Gabrielle A."},{"family":"Lindsay","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Berg","given":"Sheri M."},{"family":"Bittner","given":"Edward A."},{"family":"Chang","given":"Marvin G."}],"citation-key":"Gibson.etal_Ensuringcompetency_2020","container-title":"Journal of Intensive Care","container-title-short":"j intensive care","DOI":"10.1186/s40560-020-00503-x","ISSN":"2052-0492","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","page":"93","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ensuring competency in focused cardiac ultrasound: a systematic review of training programs","title-short":"Ensuring competency in focused cardiac ultrasound","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jintensivecare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40560-020-00503-x","volume":"8"},

The reasons for this dramatic effect are not clear but probably involves a reduction in ventilator-induced lung injury due to prone positioning, for which there is ample evidence in experimental and clinical studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Guerin","given":"C."}],"citation-key":"Guerin_Proneventilation_2014","container-title":"European Respiratory Review","container-title-short":"European Respiratory Review","DOI":"10.1183/09059180.00001114","ISSN":"0905-9180, 1600-0617","issue":"132","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"249-257","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Prone ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://err.ersjournals.com/cgi/doi/10.1183/09059180.00001114","volume":"23"},

Cautious ﬂuid management and meticulous control of arterial pressure are cornerstones of their anaesthetic management. Renal transplant in children poses the speciﬁc challenges of haemodynamic alteration, ventilation difﬁculty, and drug toxicity. In addition, these children are likely to have experienced repeated hospital admissions with multiple invasive procedures and the psychological sequelae of these events must be borne in mind. The paediatric nephrologist plays a pivotal role in the continuing management of the CKD patient and a multidisciplinary approach involving the surgeon and the anaesthetist should always be taken in the perioperative management of this patient group.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Guruswamy","given":"V"},{"family":"Barbour","given":"R"}],"citation-key":"Guruswamy.Barbour_Renaldisease_Paeds_2015","container-title":"BJA Education","container-title-short":"BJA Education","DOI":"10.1093/bjaceaccp/mku064","ISSN":"20585349","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12]]},"language":"en","page":"294-298","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Renal disease_Paeds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2058534917301245","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"Haberman_Temperaturemanagement_","abstract":"Children are at risk of hypothermia during surgery. Although there are no specific paediatric guidelines, the limited evidence available together with extrapolation from adult guidance suggests that avoidance of hypothermia in children under going non-cardiac surgery is beneficial. However, close attention to the type of surgery, choice of monitoring and warming devices used is necessary to avoid misinterpretation of temperature measurement and potential for overheating. Further evidence is needed to define the impact of prevention of hypothermia on outcomes in children, such as surgical site infection.","author":[{"family":"Haberman","given":"Dr Emily"}],"citation-key":"Haberman_Temperaturemanagement_","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Temperature management","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Han.etal_Airwayassessement_2017","abstract":"Background: Preoperative airway assessment help anticipate a difficult airway. We hypothesized that a close association existed between difficult laryngoscopy and the neck circumference/inter-incisor gap ratio (RNIIG). Our aim was to determine its utility in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in cervical spondylosis patients.\nMethods: Two hundred thirteen consecutive patients, aged 20–70 years, scheduled to undergo cervical spine surgery under general anesthesia, were recruited. Preoperative assessments included inter-incisor gap (IIG), thyromental distance (TMD), neck circumference (NC), NC/IIG ratio (RNIIG), NC/TMD ratio (RNTMD) and modified Mallampati test (MMT). Cormack–Lehane scales were assessed during intubation. The anesthesiologist was blinded to the airway assessments. RNIIG’s ability to predict difficult laryngoscopy was compared with that of established predictors.\nResults: Difficult laryngoscopy incidence was 16.4%. Univariate analysis showed that male gender, increased age, weight, NC, RNIIG and RNTMD, decreased IIG and TMD, and MMT 3 and 4 were associated with difficult laryngoscopy. Binary multivariate logistic regression analyses identified only one factor that was independently associated with difficult laryngoscopy: RNIIG. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were 1.932 (1. 504–2.482). RNIIG (≥9.5) exhibited the largest area under the curve (0.80; 95% CI 0.73–0.86) and the highest sensitivity (88.6%; 95% CI 78.1–99.1) and negative predictive value (96.6%; 95% CI 94.0–99.2), confirming its better predictive ability.\nConclusions: RNIIG is a new and simple predictor with a higher level of efficacy, and could help anesthetists plan for difficult laryngoscopy management in cervical spondylosis patients.

ENT is the most frequently performed surgery in children. These often-complex procedures are increasingly booked as day cases but judicious selection of suitable children is important. Suitability may be determined by preoperative assessment of co-morbidities, consequences of the child’s presenting pathology (e.g. obstructive sleep apnoea) or a history of recent upper respiratory tract infections.

Off‑pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery has shown to have some advantages compared to on‑pump cardiac surgery, particularly the reduction of postoperative complications including systemic inflammation, myocardial injury, and cerebral injury. Minimally invasive surgery for single vessel OPCAB through a limited thoracotomy incision can offer the advantage of further reduction of complications. The anesthesiologist has to deal with different issues, including hemodynamic instability and myocardial ischemia during aorto‑coronary bypass grafting. The anesthesiologist and surgeon should collaborate and plan the best perioperative strategy to provide optimal care and ensure a rapid and complete recovery. The use of high thoracic epidural analgesia and fast‑track anesthesia offers particular benefits in beating heart surgery. The excellent analgesia, the ability to reduce myocardial oxygen consumption, and the good hemodynamic stability make high thoracic epidural analgesia an interesting technique. New scenarios are entering in cardiac anesthesia: ultra‑fast‑track anesthesia with extubation in the operating room and awake surgery tend to be less invasive, but can only be performed on selected patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hemmerling","given":"ThomasM"},{"family":"Romano","given":"Gianmarco"},{"family":"Terrasini","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Noiseux","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"Hemmerling.etal_OPCABG_2013","container-title":"Annals of Cardiac Anaesthesia","container-title-short":"Ann Card Anaesth","DOI":"10.4103/0971-9784.105367","ISSN":"0971-9784","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"28","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"OPCABG","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/10.4103/0971-9784.105367","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"Hillelsohn.etal_MaskedPneumothorax_2013","abstract":"Purpose: Unlike traditional valved trocars, the valveless trocar maintains pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopy by forming a CO2 curtain at the proximal end of the trocar. This gas barrier instantaneously maintains exact intraperitoneal pressure that yields to the transient physiological changes seen with breathing. Due to this different mechanism of action, pneumothorax development may be masked by the valveless trocar system. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 850 transperitoneal laparoscopic kidney and adrenal surgeries in which a valveless trocar system was used to determine any record of pneumothorax detected intraoperatively or postoperatively. A patient with pneumothorax was considered a case and anesthetic parameters were reviewed. A matched control group was generated from patients treated with transperitoneal laparoscopic kidney and adrenal surgery using the valveless trocar with no complications.\nResults: Pneumothorax was diagnosed in 10 patients (1.2%). Two cases were the result of intentional excision of the diaphragm, which were repaired intraoperatively, while 8 were not recognized until the postoperative period. Five of the patients (63%) with unintentional pneumothorax required chest tube placement for a mean of 2.4 days. The remaining 3 patients (37%) were treated conservatively and followed with serial chest x-rays. The only anesthetic variable that was signiﬁcantly different between the groups was ⌬ end tidal CO2 with greater ﬂuctuations in end tidal CO2 in the pneumothorax group than in controls (p ϭ 0.03).\nConclusions: Pneumothorax is a rare complication of laparoscopic urological surgery that is usually recognized intraoperatively through physiological changes. Valveless trocar systems mask these ﬁndings and can delay identiﬁcation until the postoperative period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hillelsohn","given":"Joel H."},{"family":"Friedlander","given":"Justin I."},{"family":"Bagadiya","given":"Neeti"},{"family":"Okhunov","given":"Zhamshid"},{"family":"Kashan","given":"Mahyar"},{"family":"Schwartzur","given":"Mikhail"},{"family":"Kavoussi","given":"Louis"}],"citation-key":"Hillelsohn.etal_MaskedPneumothorax_2013","container-title":"Journal of Urology","container-title-short":"Journal of Urology","DOI":"10.1016/j.juro.2012.08.244","ISSN":"0022-5347, 1527-3792","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3]]},"language":"en","page":"955-959","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Masked Pneumothorax: Risk of Valveless Trocar Systems","title-short":"Masked Pneumothorax","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jurology.com/doi/10.1016/j.juro.2012.08.244","volume":"189"},

The objective of this systematic review was to identify and synthesise CPGs that provide perioperative recommendations specific to older adults living with frailty.\nAfter protocol registration, we performed a systematic review of CPGs. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and 14 grey literature databases were searched (January 1, 2000 until December 22, 2021). We included all CPGs that contained at least one frailty-specific recommendation related to any phase of the perioperative period. We compiled all relevant recommendations, extracted underlying strength of evidence, and categorised them by perioperative phase of care. Within each phase, recommendations were synthesised inductively into themes. Quality of CPGs was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument.\nFrom 4707 citations, 13 guidelines were included; 8/13 were focused on the perioperative care of older surgical patients in general. Among 110 recommendations extracted, 37 themes were generated, with the majority pertaining to preoperative care. Four themes were supported by strong evidence: performing preoperative frailty assessments, using multidimensional frailty instruments, reducing urinary catheter use, and following multidisciplinary care and communication throughout the perioperative period. Per AGREE II, most guidelines (8/13; 62%) were recommended for use with modifications.\nDespite increasing numbers of patients living with frailty, few guidelines exist that address frailty-specific perioperative care. Given the lack of strong evidence-based recommendations, particularly outside the preoperative period, high-quality primary research is required to underpin future guidelines and better inform the care of older surgical patients with frailty.\nPROSPERO CRD42022320149.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Allen"},{"family":"Hutton","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Camilla L."},{"family":"McIsaac","given":"Daniel I."},{"family":"Hladkowicz","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Engel","given":"Jake S."},{"family":"Tran","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Dhesi","given":"Jugdeep K."},{"family":"Lalu","given":"Manoj M."},{"family":"Khalil","given":"Noha"}],"citation-key":"Huang.etal_systematicreview_2023","container-title":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","DOI":"10.1016/j.bja.2022.12.010","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,1]]},"language":"en","source":"discovery.researcher.life","title":"A systematic review of perioperative clinical practice guidelines for care of older adults living with frailty","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://discovery.researcher.life/article/a-systematic-review-of-perioperative-clinical-practice-guidelines-for-care-of-older-adults-living-with-frailty/c2e631b92b8c3ef9bc97fa6fa1f0da99","volume":"130"},

  {"id":"Huson.etal_Cardiacultrasound_2019","abstract":"Background:  Point-of-care ultrasound is increasingly being used as a diagnostic tool in resource-limited settings. The majority of existing ultrasound protocols have been developed and implemented in high-resource settings. In subSaharan Africa (SSA), patients with heart failure of various etiologies commonly present late in the disease process, with a similar syndrome of dyspnea, edema and cardiomegaly on chest X-ray. The causes of heart failure in SSA differ from those in high-resource settings. Point-of-care ultrasound has the potential to identify the underlying etiology of heart failure, and lead to targeted therapy. Based on a literature review and weighted score of disease prevalence, diagnostic impact and difficulty in performing the ultrasound, we propose a context-specific cardiac ultrasound pro‑tocol to help differentiate patients presenting with heart failure in SSA.\nResults:  Pericardial effusion, dilated cardiomyopathy, cor pulmonale, mitral valve disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy were identified as target conditions for a focused ultrasound protocol in patients with cardiac failure and cardiomegaly in SSA. By utilizing a simplified 5-question approach with all images obtained from the subxiphoid view, the protocol is suitable for use by health care professionals with limited ultrasound experience.\nConclusions:  The “Cardiac ultrasound for resource-limited settings (CURLS)” protocol is a context-specific algorithm designed to aid the clinician in diagnosing the five most clinically relevant etiologies of heart failure and cardiomegaly in SSA. The protocol has the potential to influence treatment decisions in patients who present with clinical signs of heart failure in resource-limited settings outside of the traditional referral institutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Huson","given":"Michaëla A.

  {"id":"Hutchinson_Generalanaesthesia_2011","abstract":"Dental anaesthesia developed down a different pathway from the rest of anaesthesia. Techniques such as nasal mask anaesthesia in the sitting position were speciﬁc to dental surgery, which took place largely outside hospital in dental clinics. Now dental anaesthesia is conﬁned to locations within the aegis of a hospital and anaesthetic techniques are similar to those in other surgical specialities. Dental surgery consists of extractions and conservation. Short procedures for the extraction of teeth may still be carried out in children using a nasal mask, but more difﬁcult extractions in adults and children, or conservation procedures are best done with a laryngeal mask or endotracheal tube. Close liaison with the dental surgeon is imperative in the planning of the anaesthetic technique. The downward pressure applied to the mandible during the extraction of teeth may cause reduction in airway patency unless intubated, and the anaesthetist may need to support the jaw and head in order to provide counter-pressure, also preventing excessive movement of the neck.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Hutchinson","given":"Susan"}],"citation-key":"Hutchinson_Generalanaesthesia_2011","container-title":"Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine","container-title-short":"Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.mpaic.2011.05.005","ISSN":"14720299","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",8]]},"language":"en","page":"347-350","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"General anaesthesia for dentistry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1472029911001214","volume":"12"},

The following clinical conditions were considered: major surgery, critical illness, sepsis, shock, exposure to potentially nephrotoxic drugs and radiocontrast. Clinical endpoints included incidence or grade of AKI, the need for renal replacement therapy and mortality. Studies were graded according to the international GRADE system.\nResults:  We formulated 12 recommendations, 13 suggestions and seven best practice statements. The few strong recommendations with high-level evidence are mostly against the intervention in question (starches, low-dose dopa‑mine, statins in cardiac surgery). Strong recommendations with lower-level evidence include controlled fluid resusci‑tation with crystalloids, avoiding fluid overload, titration of norepinephrine to a target MAP of 65–70 mmHg (unless chronic hypertension) and not using diuretics or levosimendan for kidney protection solely.\nConclusion:  The results of recent randomised controlled trials have allowed the formulation of new recommenda‑tions and/or increase the strength of previous recommendations.

  {"id":"Kamel.Shoukry_Magnesiumsulfate_2022","abstract":"Background: Magnesium (Mg) is a non-competitive N-methyl D-aspartate receptor antagonist with antinociceptive effects. Multimodal therapy is the optimal strategy for perioperative pain control to minimize the need for opioids. Inflammation caused by tissue trauma or direct nerve injury is responsible for the perioperative pain. The concept of “pre-emptive” analgesia, analgesic strategies administered prior to the stimulus, can modify the peripheral and central nervous system processing of noxious stimuli, thereby reducing central sensitization, hyperalgesia, and allodynia remains controversial. A more encompassing approach to the reduction of postoperative pain is the concept of “preventive” analgesia. The purpose of the study is to detect the proper use of MgSO4 as an analgesic being a non-competitive N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA).\nResults: There is no statistically significant difference in the haemodynamic parameters, intraoperative (33% vs 20%) and postoperative requirement for analgesics 6.6% vs 10% among groups I and II, respectively. There is no significant difference in the numerical analogue scale, where 16 vs 17 patients with no pain, 12 vs 10 with mild pain, and 2 vs 3 with moderate pain in groups I and II, respectively.\nConclusion: The use of MgSO4 in a bolus with or without infusion is comparable in the control of intraoperative and postoperative pain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Kamel","given":"Walid Y."},{"family":"Shoukry","given":"Aktham Adel"}],"citation-key":"Kamel.Shoukry_Magnesiumsulfate_2022","container-title":"Ain-Shams Journal of Anesthesiology","container-title-short":"Ain-Shams J Anesthesiol","DOI":"10.1186/s42077-021-00210-1","ISSN":"2090-925X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"language":"en","page":"7","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Magnesium sulfate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1186/s42077-021-00210-1","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"Karanatsios.etal_Definingkey_2020","abstract":"Background: Traditional randomised controlled trials remain the gold standard for improving clinical care but they do have their limitations, including their associated high costs, high failure rate and limited external validity. An alternative methodology is the newly defined, prospective, registry-based randomised controlled trial (RRCT), where treatment and outcome data is collected in an existing registry. This scoping review explores the current literature regarding RRCTs to help identify the key design elements of RRCTs and the characteristics of clinical registries on which they are reliant on.\nMethods: A scoping review methodology conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines was performed. Four databases were searched for articles published from inception to June 2018: Medline; Embase; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and; Scopus. The search strategy included MeSH and text words related to RRCT.\nResults: We identified 2369 articles of which 75 were selected for full-text screening. Of these, only 17 articles satisfied our inclusion criteria. All studies were published between 1996 and 2017 and all were investigator-initiated. Study designs were mainly multi-site comparative/effectiveness studies incorporating the use of disease registries (n = 8), procedure registries (n = 8) and a health services registry (n = 1). The low cost, reduced administrative burden and enhanced external validity of RRCTs make them an attractive research methodology which can be used to address questions of public health importance. We identified that that there are variable definitions of what constituted a RRCT and that issues related to ethical conduct and data integrity, completeness, timeliness, validation and endpoint adjudication need to be carefully addressed.\nConclusion: RRCTs potentially have an important role to play in informing best clinical practice and health policy. There are a number of issues that need to be addressed to optimise the utility of this approach, including establishing universally accepted criteria for the definition of a RRCT.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Karanatsios","given":"Bill"},{"family":"Prang","given":"Khic-Houy"},{"family":"Verbunt","given":"Ebony"},{"family":"Yeung","given":"Justin M."},{"family":"Kelaher","given":"Margaret"},{"family":"Gibbs","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"Karanatsios.etal_Definingkey_2020","container-title":"Trials","container-title-short":"Trials","DOI":"10.1186/s13063-020-04459-z","ISSN":"1745-6215","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","page":"552","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Defining key design elements of registry-based randomised controlled trials: a scoping review","title-short":"Defining key design elements of registry-based randomised controlled trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-020-04459-z","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"Kathrada.etal_Perioperativeultrasound_2021","abstract":"Background: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is becoming part of the standard skill set of the modern-day anaesthetist. There is limited knowledge regarding the availability of ultrasound (US) and POCUS skills in South Africa. There may be barriers to adopting US in many institutions.\nMethods: An observational cohort questionnaire was distributed via an online REDCap survey. All doctors practising anaesthesia in South Africa were eligible. Recruitment was done via an email link that was sent to South African Society of Anaesthesiologists (SASA) members. Non-SASA members were recruited via departmental mailing lists or social media.\nResults: Of the 580 respondents, 478 were SASA members (response rate 22.9%, confidence interval 3.94) and 102 were nonSASA members. In total, 571 surveys were suitable for analysis, 397 (69.5%) respondents had more than five years anaesthesia experience, 558 (97.7%) of respondents worked in hospitals that have US machines available, and 76.7% had US readily available after hours. Respondents used US mostly for central venous catheter (CVC) insertions (77.9%), regional anaesthesia (82.3%), and cardiac and lung assessments (26.4% and 17.7%, respectively). It is used much less frequently for neuraxial anaesthesia (1.4%). Of the respondents, 382 (66.9%) had received US training, only 198 (34.7%) felt confident in their US skills, and 482 (84.4%) wish to have further US training. The two most significant barriers to US were lack of equipment and lack of training at postgraduate level.\nConclusion: South African anaesthetists work at institutions where US equipment is generally available, and most practitioners want to incorporate US in their practice. However, anaesthetists feel insecure with respect to their skills and indicated that they wish to receive further training. Efforts should be made to formalise POCUS training in the Fellowship of the College of Anaesthetists (FCA) curriculum and make US training more accessible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Kathrada","given":"Mis"},{"family":"Jagga","given":"M"},{"family":"Mzoneli","given":"Yn"},{"family":"Swanevelder","given":"J"},{"family":"Gibbs","given":"Mw"}],"citation-key":"Kathrada.etal_Perioperativeultrasound_2021","container-title":"Southern African Journal of Anaesthesia and Analgesia","container-title-short":"Southern African Journal of Anaesthesia and Analgesia","DOI":"10.36303/SAJAA.2021.27.6.2636","ISSN":"2220-1181, 2220-1173","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"language":"en","page":"271-277","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Perioperative ultrasound among South African anaesthetists: a survey of current practice and availability","title-short":"Perioperative ultrasound among South African anaesthetists","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.co.za/doi/10.36303/SAJAA.2021.27.6.2636","volume":"27"},

Previously, traumatologists and investigators identified iatrogenic and resuscitation-associated causes of coagulopathic bleeding after traumatic injury, including hypothermia, metabolic acidosis, and dilutional coagulopathy that were recognized as primary drivers of bleeding after trauma. However, the last 10 years has seen a widespread paradigm shift in the resuscitation of critically injured patients, and there has been a dramatic evolution in our understanding of trauma-induced coagulopathy. Although there is no consensus regarding a definition or an approach to the classification and naming of trauma-associated coagulation impairment, trauma itself and/or traumatic shockinduced endogenous coagulopathy are both referred to as acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC), and multifactorial trauma-associated coagulation impairment, including ATC and resuscitation-associated coagulopathy is recognized as trauma-induced coagulopathy.

  {"id":"Lawson_Whatmedical_2011","abstract":"The attempt by humans to formulate principles and codes for moral behaviour is a feature of all known civilizations. Ethics, or moral philosophy, came about with the Sophists of Greece in the fourth century BC, some critics of medical ethics claim it is just sophistry. The critics are right in a way, not in the sense that ethical debate is subtly deceptive or necessarily sophisticated, but only in the sense that examination of critical ideas of moral conduct and techniques by which to discuss moral problems has its roots in Sophist Greece. The relationship between doctor and patient has always had a moral component, hitherto this component has been assumed. Swearing the Hippocratic oath and or qualiﬁcation was deemed to be sufﬁcient moral education. However the changes in biotechnology, changes in research ethics and profound sociological and cultural changes have made this assumption untenable. Knowledge of formal ethical models and an understanding of ethical principles have been inserted back into the medical curriculum where once it was studied as part of philosophy. This review summarises current ethical teaching. 1.

  {"id":"Lawson_Whatmedical_2011a","abstract":"The attempt by humans to formulate principles and codes for moral behaviour is a feature of all known civilizations. Ethics, or moral philosophy, came about with the Sophists of Greece in the fourth century BC, some critics of medical ethics claim it is just sophistry. The critics are right in a way, not in the sense that ethical debate is subtly deceptive or necessarily sophisticated, but only in the sense that examination of critical ideas of moral conduct and techniques by which to discuss moral problems has its roots in Sophist Greece. The relationship between doctor and patient has always had a moral component, hitherto this component has been assumed. Swearing the Hippocratic oath and or qualiﬁcation was deemed to be sufﬁcient moral education. However the changes in biotechnology, changes in research ethics and profound sociological and cultural changes have made this assumption untenable. Knowledge of formal ethical models and an understanding of ethical principles have been inserted back into the medical curriculum where once it was studied as part of philosophy. This review summarises current ethical teaching. 1.

Proper assessment and management of various cardiac conditions in the peri-operative period by anaesthetists can markedly improve patient safety, especially in high-risk patient populations. This involves understanding and applying current evidence-based practice and international guidelines on the main aspects of cardiac optimisation, including management of patients with hypertension, chronic heart failure, valvular heart diseases and cardiac implantable electronic devices. Peri-operative management of antihypertensive drugs in keeping with the current best evidence is discussed. Pre-operative cardiac risk assessment and cardiac biomarkers can be used to help predict and quantify peri-operative adverse cardiac events. There is an increasing need for anaesthetist-led services, including focused transthoracic echocardiography and management of implantable cardiac electronic devices. Anaesthetists should be encouraged to play a proactive role in pre-operative risk stratiﬁcation and make timely multidisciplinary referrals if necessary. A personalised approach to pre-operative cardiac optimisation enables a safer peri-operative journey for at-risk patients undergoing major surgery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"L.

Maternal-infant or vertical transmission is the most common mode of HIV infection in children. As transplacental passage of maternal anti-HIV antibodies, diagnosis of HIV infection in young infants relies on virologic assays. Infants older than 18 months of age can be diagnosed by serology alone. Pediatric HIV infections are classiﬁed according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention 1994 revised classiﬁcation system. The understanding of viral pathogenesis, the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy, and the ability to quantitate viral burden have led to signiﬁcant reduction in disease progression and morbidity in HIV-infected children. As survival improves, these children will require anesthesia care and pain treatment during the course of their illness. Considerations for the anesthesiologist include: possible involvement of multiple organ systems, adverse reactions and drug interactions of antiretroviral agents and adequate infection control to prevent HIV transmission in hospital and other infections to the immunocompromized patients. Finally, care should be taken not to violate conﬁdentiality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Leelanukrom","given":"Ruenreong"},{"family":"Pancharoen","given":"Chitsanu"}],"citation-key":"Leelanukrom.Pancharoen_HIVinfected_2007","container-title":"Pediatric Anesthesia","container-title-short":"Pediatric Anesthesia","DOI":"10.1111/j.1460-9592.2006.02150.x","ISSN":"1155-5645, 1460-9592","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",6]]},"language":"en","page":"509-519","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"HIV‐infected children","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-9592.2006.02150.x","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"Lichtenstein_Lungultrasound_2009","abstract":"Critical ultrasound, apparently a recent field, is in fact the outcome of a slow process, initiated since 1946. The lung was traditionally not considered as part of ultrasound, yet we considered its inclusion as a priority in our definition of critical ultrasound. Acute respiratory failure is one of the most distressing situations for the patient. An ultrasound approach of this disorder - the BLUE-protocol — allows rapid diagnosis. Its main features will be described. Each kind of respiratory failure provides a particular ultrasound profile. In this difficult setting, initial mistakes are frequent. The BLUE-protocol proposes a step-by-step approach for making accurate diagnosis. By combining three signs with binary answer (anterior lung sliding, anterior lung-rockets), with venous analysis when required, seven profiles are generated, yielding a 90.5% accuracy. This rate is highly enhanced when simple clinical and laboratory data are considered. The BLUE-protocol can be achieved in three minutes, because the use of an intelligent machine, a universal probe, and standardized points allow major time-saving. Lung ultrasound in the critically ill was long available. In a domain where everything must be fast and accurate, the BLUE-protocol can play a major role in the diagnosis of an acute respiratory failure, usually answering immediately to questions where only sophisticated techniques were hitherto used.","author":[{"family":"Lichtenstein","given":"D"}],"citation-key":"Lichtenstein_Lungultrasound_2009","container-title":"MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Lung ultrasound in acute respiratory failure an introduction to the BLUE-protocol","type":"article-journal","volume":"75"},
  {"id":"Lichtenstein.Meziere_RelevanceLung_2008","abstract":"Background: This study assesses the potential of lung ultrasonography to diagnose acute respiratory failure.\nMethods: This observational study was conducted in university-affiliated teaching-hospital ICUs. We performed ultrasonography on consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, comparing lung ultrasonography results on initial presentation with the final diagnosis by the ICU team. Uncertain diagnoses and rare causes (frequency < 2%) were excluded. We included 260 dyspneic patients with a definite diagnosis. Three items were assessed: artifacts (horizontal A lines or vertical B lines indicating interstitial syndrome), lung sliding, and alveolar consolidation and/or pleural effusion. Combined with venous analysis, these items were grouped to assess ultrasound profiles.\nResults: Predominant A lines plus lung sliding indicated asthma (n ؍ 34) or COPD (n ؍ 49) with 89% sensitivity and 97% specificity. Multiple anterior diffuse B lines with lung sliding indicated pulmonary edema (n ؍ 64) with 97% sensitivity and 95% specificity. A normal anterior profile plus deep venous thrombosis indicated pulmonary embolism (n ؍ 21) with 81% sensitivity and 99% specificity. Anterior absent lung sliding plus A lines plus lung point indicated pneumothorax (n ؍ 9) with 81% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Anterior alveolar consolidations, anterior diffuse B lines with abolished lung sliding, anterior asymmetric interstitial patterns, posterior consolidations or effusions without anterior diffuse B lines indicated pneumonia (n ؍ 83) with 89% sensitivity and 94% specificity. The use of these profiles would have provided correct diagnoses in 90.5% of cases.\nConclusions: Lung ultrasound can help the clinician make a rapid diagnosis in patients with acute respiratory failure, thus meeting the priority objective of saving time.

  {"id":"Malbrain.etal_IVfluid_2020","abstract":"Intravenous fluid administration should be considered as any other pharmacological prescription. There are three main indications: resuscitation, replacement, and maintenance. Moreover, the impact of fluid administration as drug diluent or to preserve catheter patency, i.e., fluid creep, should also be considered. As for antibiotics, intravenous fluid administration should follow the four Ds: drug, dosing, duration, de-escalation. Among crystalloids, balanced solutions limit acid–base alterations and chloride load and should be preferred, as this likely prevents renal dysfunction. Among colloids, albumin, the only available natural colloid, may have beneficial effects. The last decade has seen growing interest in the potential harms related to fluid overloading. In the perioperative setting, appropriate fluid management that maintains adequate organ perfusion while limiting fluid administration should represent the standard of care. Protocols including a restrictive continuous fluid administration alongside bolus administration to achieve hemodynamic targets have been proposed. A similar approach should be considered also for critically ill patients, in whom increased endothelial permeability makes this strategy more relevant. Active de-escalation protocols may be necessary in a later phase. The R.O.S.E. conceptual model (Resuscitation, Optimization, Stabilization, Evacuation) summarizes accurately a dynamic approach to fluid therapy, maximizing benefits and minimizing harms. Even in specific categories of critically ill patients, i.e., with trauma or burns, fluid therapy should be carefully applied, considering the importance of their specific aims; maintaining peripheral oxygen delivery, while avoiding the consequences of fluid overload.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Malbrain","given":"Manu L.

  {"id":"Mathes.etal_Registrybasedrandomized_2018","abstract":"Objectives: The objective of this study was to analyze the features of registry-based randomized trials (rRCTs). Study Design and Setting: We systematically searched PubMed for rRCTs. Study selection was performed independently by two reviewers. We extracted all data in standardized tables and prepared descriptive summary statistics.\nResults: The search resulted in 1,202 hits. We included 71 rRCTs. Most rRCTs were from Denmark and Sweden. Chronic conditions were considered in 82.2%. A preventive intervention was examined in 45.1%. The median of included patients was 2,000 (range: 69e246,079). Deﬁnition of the study population was mostly broad. Study procedures were regularly little standardized. The number of included and analyzed patients was the same in 82.1%. In half of the rRCTs, more than one registry was utilized. Various linkage techniques were used. In median, two outcomes were collected from the registry/ies. The median follow-up of the rRCTs was 5.3 years (range: 6 weeks to 27 years). Information on quality of registry data was reported in 11.3%.\nConclusion: rRCTs can provide valid (randomization, low lost-to-follow-up rates, generalizable) patient important long-term comparative-effectiveness data for relative little effort. Researchers planning an RCT should always check whether existing registries can be used for data collection. Reporting on data quality must be improved for use in evidence synthesis.

The objective of this editorial is three-fold. First, we discuss the factors that influence sample size decisions. Second, we review existing rules of thumb related to the calculation of sample size. Third, we present the guidelines to perform power analysis using the G*Power programme. There is, however, a caveat: we urge researchers not to blindly follow these rules. Such rules or guidelines should be understood in their specific contexts and under the conditions in which they were prescribed.

  {"id":"Mensah.Gooding_Inheritedbleeding_2015","abstract":"It is estimated that up to 1% of the general population has a congenital bleeding disorder. With this level of disease burden, it is more likely than not that any practising surgeon or anaesthetist will, at one time or another, have occasion to manage one such patient. Congenital haemophilia, both A and B, von Willebrand’s disease, and inherited qualitative platelet defects, constitute the bulk of these disorders, with the rest distributed between much rarer conditions. Although looking after such patients will continue to pose a challenge to anaesthetists, recent and continuing advances in haemostatic products, coupled with increasing awareness of haemostatic care, means that surgery in this challenging group of patients is safer now than ever before, and can now be undertaken with a degree of conﬁdence not possible even two decades ago. Central to these recent successes has been the continuing evolution of specialised healthcare services; in particular, Haemophilia Comprehensive Care Centres. Of equal importance, at least in developed countries, has been the ease of access to highly puriﬁed, safe and effective haemostatic products. The key to successful surgical management of the patient with a bleeding disorder is a multidisciplinary approach involving not only surgeons, anaesthetists and haematologists, but also laboratory scientists, specialist physiotherapists and haemophilia nurses. With careful planning, most surgical and invasive procedures can be carried out safely in persons with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Mensah","given":"P.

  {"id":"Mercer.etal_Airwaytrauma_2016","abstract":"Introduction: Non-iatrogenic trauma to the airway is rare and presents a signiﬁcant challenge to the anaesthetist. Although guidelines for the management of the unanticipated difﬁcult airway have been published, these do not make provision for the ‘anticipated’ difﬁcult airway. This systematic review aims to inform best practice and suggest management options for different injury patterns.\nMethods: A literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline, and Google Scholar for papers after the year 2000 reporting on the acute airway management of adult patients who suffered airway trauma. Our protocol and search strategy are registered with and published by PROSPERO (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO, ID: CRD42016032763).\nResults: A systematic literature search yielded 578 articles, of which a total of 148 full-text papers were reviewed. We present our results categorized by mechanism of injury: blunt, penetrating, blast, and burns.\nConclusions: The hallmark of airway management with trauma to the airway is the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation, intubation under direct vision to avoid the creation of a false passage, and the avoidance of both intermittent positive pressure ventilation and cricoid pressure (the latter for laryngotracheal trauma only) during a rapid sequence induction. Management depends on available resources and time to perform airway assessment, investigations, and intervention ( patients will be classiﬁed into one of three categories: no time, some time, or adequate time). Human factors, particularly the development of a shared mental model amongst the trauma team, are vital to mitigate risk and improve patient safety.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Mercer","given":"S.J."},{"family":"Jones","given":"C.P."},{"family":"Bridge","given":"M."},{"family":"Clitheroe","given":"E."},{"family":"Morton","given":"B."},{"family":"Groom","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Mercer.etal_Airwaytrauma_2016","container-title":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","container-title-short":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","DOI":"10.1093/bja/aew193","ISSN":"00070912","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9]]},"language":"en","page":"i49-i59","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Airway trauma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0007091217337686","volume":"117"},

  {"id":"Monnet.etal_Fluidresponsiveness_2022","abstract":"Although the administration of fluid is the first treatment considered in almost all cases of circulatory failure, this therapeutic option poses two essential problems: the increase in cardiac output induced by a bolus of fluid is incon‑stant, and the deleterious effects of fluid overload are now clearly demonstrated. This is why many tests and indices have been developed to detect preload dependence and predict fluid responsiveness. In this review, we take stock of the data published in the field over the past three years. Regarding the passive leg raising test, we detail the different stroke volume surrogates that have recently been described to measure its effects using minimally invasive and easily accessible methods. We review the limits of the test, especially in patients with intra-abdominal hypertension. Regard‑ing the end-expiratory occlusion test, we also present recent investigations that have sought to measure its effects without an invasive measurement of cardiac output. Although the limits of interpretation of the respiratory variation of pulse pressure and of the diameter of the vena cava during mechanical ventilation are now well known, several recent studies have shown how changes in pulse pressure variation itself during other tests reflect simultaneous changes in cardiac output, allowing these tests to be carried out without its direct measurement. This is particularly the case during the tidal volume challenge, a relatively recent test whose reliability is increasingly well established. The mini-fluid challenge has the advantage of being easy to perform, but it requires direct measurement of cardiac output, like the classic fluid challenge. Initially described with echocardiography, recent studies have investigated other means of judging its effects. We highlight the problem of their precision, which is necessary to evidence small changes in cardiac output. Finally, we point out other tests that have appeared more recently, such as the Trendelen‑burg manoeuvre, a potentially interesting alternative for patients in the prone position.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Monnet","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Teboul","given":"Jean-Louis"}],"citation-key":"Monnet.etal_Fluidresponsiveness_2022","container-title":"Annals of Intensive Care","container-title-short":"Ann.

These facts kindle interest to review the predictive parameters, preventive measures, and all the possibilities in the management and protection against perioperative stroke.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Nagre","given":"AmarjaS"}],"citation-key":"Nagre_Perioperativestroke_2018","container-title":"Indian Journal of Anaesthesia","container-title-short":"Indian J Anaesth","DOI":"10.4103/ija.IJA_292_18","ISSN":"0019-5049","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"738","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Perioperative stroke – Prediction, Prevention, and Protection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/10.4103/ija.IJA_292_18","volume":"62"},

However, the use of an inhalational technique is sometimes not possible, and in some situations, inhalational anaesthesia is contraindicated. Therefore, all anaesthetists should be able to deliver total intravenous anaesthesia competently and safely. For the purposes of simplicity, these guidelines will use the term total intravenous anaesthesia but also encompass techniques involving a combination of intravenous infusion and inhalational anaesthesia.

Affected patients fall into 4 classifications each displaying the similar properties of easily fractured bones, hypermobile joints, blue or gray sclera, skeletal deformities, and fragile skin. More severe forms of the disease may manifest platelet dysfunction, cardiac anomalies, hypermetabolic syndromes, respiratory compromise, and/or basilar invagination. Treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta is mainly supportive, consisting of prompt surgical treatment of fractures to prevent deformity and maintaining mobility to lessen the chance of pulmonary or cardiovascular complications. These treatment modalities make anesthesia of paramount importance. Current literature exposes many potential anesthetic complications associated with osteogenesis imperfecta. The research shows that implications range from simply positioning the patient on the operating room table to management of rare occurrences such as malignant hyperthermia and basilar invagination. Commonly encountered complications include a difficult airway, intraoperative bleeding due to platelet dysfunction, respiratory compromise due to skeletal deformity, and congenital cardiac anomalies. Proper preparation and preoperative assessment is important, as is the choice of anesthetic technique. Correct identification of risk factors and optimization of health before surgery should lead to an uneventful anesthetic course.","author":[{"family":"Oakley","given":"Ingrid"},{"family":"Reece","given":"Lauren Pilleteri"}],"citation-key":"Oakley.Reece_OsteogenesisImperfecta_","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Osteogenesis Imperfecta","type":"article-journal"},

In addition, anaesthesia and patient positioning may impose physiological stresses on these tissues. Patients are often required to assume positions for surgery which would be intolerable without anaesthesia; these positions may introduce hazards which can lead to injury. Positioning of patients under anaesthesia is an important subject for anaesthetists to consider, since patient positioning has implications upon the patient’s physiological responses as well as potentially causing injury to the patient. We describe the considerations for the anaesthetist when positioning the surgical patient. We discuss the positions commonly used for surgical patients and relate the challenges associated with each of these positions, challenges which can be physical as well as physiological. Stafﬁng and equipment provision levels must be adequate to cope with the complexity predicted in positioning an individual patient. The anaesthetist also needs to consider the relatively restricted access to the patient for intervention when in the prone or lateral positions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Connor","given":"Dominic"},{"family":"Radcliffe","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"OConnor.Radcliffe_Patientpositioning_2018","container-title":"Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine","container-title-short":"Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.mpaic.2018.08.019","ISSN":"14720299","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11]]},"language":"en","page":"585-590","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Patient positioning in anaesthesia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1472029918302078","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"Ortner.etal_PointofCareUltrasound_2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pilot studies applying point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in preeclampsia indicate the presence of pulmonary interstitial edema, cerebral edema, and cardiac dysfunction. Laboratory markers of oncotic pressure (albumin) and cardiac dysfunction (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]) may be abnormal, but the clinical application remains unclear. We investigated the prevalence of pulmonary interstitial syndrome (PIS), cardiac dysfunction, and increased optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) in late-onset preeclampsia with severe features. The primary aim was to examine the association between PIS or ONSD and maternal serum albumin level. The secondary aims were to explore the association between cardiac dysfunction and PIS, ONSD, BNP, and serum albumin level and between POCUS-derived parameters and a suspicious or pathological cardiotocograph.\nMETHODS: Ninety-five women were enrolled in this prospective observational cohort study. A POCUS examination of lungs, heart, and ONSD was performed. PIS was defined as a bilateral B-line pattern on lung ultrasound and diastolic dysfunction according to an algorithm of the American Society of Echocardiography. ONSD >5.8 mm was interpreted as compatible with raised intracranial pressure (>20 mm Hg). Serum BNP and albumin levels were also measured.\nRESULTS: PIS, diastolic dysfunction, systolic dysfunction, and raised left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were present in 23 (24%), 31 (33%), 9 (10%), and 20 (25%) women, respectively. ONSD was increased in 27 (28%) women. Concerning the primary outcome, there was no association between albumin level and PIS (P = .4) or ONSD (P = .63). With respect to secondary outcomes, there was no association between albumin level and systolic dysfunction (P = .21) or raised LVEDP (P = .44). PIS was associated with diastolic dysfunction (P = .02) and raised LVEDP (P = .009; negative predictive value, 85%). BNP level was associated with systolic (P < .001) and diastolic dysfunction (P = .003) and LVEDP (P = .007). No association was found between POCUS abnormalities and a suspicious/pathological cardiotocograph (P = .07).\nCONCLUSIONS: PIS, diastolic dysfunction, and increased ONSD were common in preeclampsia with severe features. Cardiac ultrasound abnormalities may be more useful than albumin levels in predicting PIS. The absence of PIS may exclude raised LVEDP. The further clinical relevance of PIS and raised ONSD remains to be established. BNP level was associated with cardiac ultrasound abnormalities. Although this study was not designed to directly influence clinical management, the findings suggest that POCUS may serve as a useful adjunct to clinical examination for the obstetric anesthesiologist managing these complex patients.  (Anesth Analg 2019;128:1208–16)","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Ortner","given":"C.M."},{"family":"Krishnamoorthy","given":"V."},{"family":"Neethling","given":"E."},{"family":"Flint","given":"M."},{"family":"Swanevelder","given":"J.L."},{"family":"Lombard","given":"C."},{"family":"Fawcus","given":"S."},{"family":"Dyer","given":"R.A."}],"citation-key":"Ortner.etal_PointofCareUltrasound_2020","container-title":"Obstetric Anesthesia Digest","DOI":"10.1097/01.aoa.0000652916.46974.79","ISSN":"0275-665X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3]]},"language":"en","page":"37-37","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Point-of-Care Ultrasound Abnormalities in Late-Onset Severe Preeclampsia: Prevalence and Association With Serum Albumin and Brain Natriuretic Peptide","title-short":"Point-of-Care Ultrasound Abnormalities in Late-Onset Severe Preeclampsia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/01.aoa.0000652916.46974.79","volume":"40"},

OBJECTIVE: To compare lung ultrasound patterns in third-trimester gravidas with and without preeclampsia and assess interobserver agreement between 3 obstetrical providers and a physician expert in critical care lung ultrasound. STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective observational study of 262 women with singleton pregnancies between 32 0/7 and 41 6/7 weeks’ gestation. Lung ultrasound examinations were performed and interpreted by a team of obstetrical care providers and then interpreted by an expert in point-of-care lung ultrasound. The number of B-lines in each of the 4 lung ﬁelds, indicating the accumulation of ﬂuid in the interstitial space and the alveoli, was evaluated. The primary outcome was a positive study for pulmonary interstitial edema, deﬁned as an ultrasound study with 3 or more B-lines in 2 or more bilateral lung ﬁelds. The secondary outcome was a lung ultrasound study with 1 or 2 B-lines in 1 or more lung ﬁelds or 3 B-lines in 1 lung ﬁeld. Interobserver agreement in lung ultrasound interpretation between obstetrical care providers and an expert in critical care point-of-care ultrasonography of the lung was assessed. RESULTS: Among healthy gravidas, no subject had a lung ultrasound examination positive for pulmonary interstitial edema. Notably, 2 patients with preeclampsia had positive lung ultrasound studies, and both had respiratory symptoms or signs of pulmonary edema. One or 2 B-lines or 3 Blines in 1 lung ﬁeld were identiﬁed in 11.4% of healthy gravidas and 18.6% of patients with preeclampsia. There was no difference in lung ultrasound patterns between healthy gravidas and those with preeclampsia. The obstetrical care providers and the lung ultrasound expert had a high proportion of agreement regarding the interpretation of negative lung ultrasound examinations. The 2 patients with clinical signs of pulmonary edema were judged to have positive studies by both the obstetrical team and the expert; however, the obstetrical team classiﬁed more studies as positive. CONCLUSION: Lung ultrasound patterns in women with preeclampsia without respiratory symptoms or clinical signs of pulmonary edema are similar to the lung ultrasound patterns of healthy gravidas. Point-of-care lung ultrasound can be used to evaluate third-trimester gravidas with preeclampsia and respiratory complaints or signs concerning for pulmonary edema. Formal training is important before the widespread adoption of point-of-care lung ultrasound by obstetrical healthcare providers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Pachtman Shetty","given":"Sarah L."},{"family":"Koenig","given":"Seth"},{"family":"Tenenbaum","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Meirowitz","given":"Natalie"}],"citation-key":"PachtmanShetty.etal_Pointofcarelung_2021","container-title":"American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM","container-title-short":"American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajogmf.2021.100310","ISSN":"25899333","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3]]},"language":"en","page":"100310","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Point-of-care lung ultrasound patterns in late third-trimester gravidas with and without preeclampsia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589933321000057","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"Patino.etal_Obstructivesleep_2013","abstract":"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has become a major public health concern as its incidence and severity have increased in tandem with the obesity epidemic. In children, OSA is now recognized as a common disorder and can be associated with signiﬁcant morbidity. OSA belongs to a spectrum of diagnoses known as sleep-related breathing disorders in which the airway is completely (apnoea) or partially (hypopnoea) occluded during sleep despite continued respiratory efforts. This airway obstruction can cause abnormal gas exchange leading to hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, sleep fragmentation, and their attendant physiological and behavioural consequences. The degrees of hypercapnia, hypoxaemia, and upper airway airﬂow reduction are the primary factors determining the severity of OSA. In young children, adenotonsillar hypertrophy is the most common anatomical abnormality associated with OSA, and adenotonsillectomy is, therefore, the most common surgical intervention. Perioperative complications associated with adenotonsillectomy are more common in children with severe OSA. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of OSA, careful and complete preoperative assessment, meticulous intraoperative and postoperative management, and early recognition of potential perioperative complications are essential to optimization of outcomes. The safe anaesthetic management of a child with OSA requires an anaesthetic technique tailored to the underlying aetiology and severity of OSA and the surgical procedure. This review focuses on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of OSA, and the stateof-the-art and future directions in the perioperative management of children with OSA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Patino","given":"M."},{"family":"Sadhasivam","given":"S."},{"family":"Mahmoud","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Patino.etal_Obstructivesleep_2013","container-title":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","container-title-short":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","DOI":"10.1093/bja/aet371","ISSN":"00070912","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12]]},"language":"en","page":"i83-i95","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Obstructive sleep apnoea in children: perioperative considerations","title-short":"Obstructive sleep apnoea in children","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0007091217309339","volume":"111"},

  {"id":"Pegu_Novelultrasound_2021","abstract":"Ultrasonography allows for rapid acquisition of high-resolution images of anatomic structures in real time. Urgent diagnostic uses of ultrasound (US) will include a rapid diagnosis or confirmation of perioperative haemodynamic instability, shock, cardiac dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, airway issues, intra-abdominal pathology or trauma, bladder distention and abnormal urine output. Multi-organ point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) including lung ultrasound (LUS) and focussed cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) as a clinical adjunct has played a significant role in triaging, diagnosis and medical management of COVID-19 patients. An optic US can be done with the width of the optic nerve sheath being used as a marker for intracranial pressure. Perioperative POCUS of the airway has been shown to aid in the identification of a difficult airway, detection of the appropriate location of the endotracheal tube within the trachea, and with assistance with emergent cricothyrotomy procedures. LUS can be used to detect lung sliding which will be absent in any condition in which the pleurae are not directly opposed, stuck together, or in absent respiration. Interstitial lung syndromes, pneumothorax, alveolar syndrome, pleural effusions, pulmonary emboli and acute respiratory failure can be assessed. Cardiovascular US is a safe and cost‑effective tool for non‑invasive examination of the real time cardiac status. Views include the subcostal view, apical four chamber view, parasternal long axis and parasternal short axis view. By visualising the contents of the stomach, the risk of pulmonary aspiration can be determined more accurately compared to relying solely on predefined fasting times. The advent of focussed assessment with sonography in trauma enables clinicians to rapidly screen for injury. A qualitative assessment of bladder distension can be performed. Ultrasonography identifies thrombus as non-compressibility of the imaged vein. The use of US guidance is frequently used for placement of venous and arterial catheters.","author":[{"family":"Pegu","given":"KD"}],"citation-key":"Pegu_Novelultrasound_2021","container-title-short":"South Afr J Anaesth Analg","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.36303/SAJAA.2021.27.6.S1.2721","issue":"27(6 Suppl 1)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"S105-110","source":"Zotero","title":"Novel ultrasound techniques","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Pritchard_Ophthalmicsurgery_2014","abstract":"Local anaesthesia for eye surgery is increasingly popular, but there will always be a need for general anaesthesia. Patients may refuse local anaesthesia, may be unable to keep still or lie ﬂat for the duration of surgery or lack the mental facility to cooperate whilst awake. Young children and those with allergy to local anaesthetic also need general anaesthesia. Careful patient preparation is important before surgery. Glycaemic control in patients with diabetes, adjustments to warfarin or aspirin dosing, thromboembolic prophylaxis and preoperative fasting need to be considered. Eye surgery alone is rarely a true emergency, and surgery can usually wait until the patient’s stomach is empty. Eye pathology requiring surgery is a feature of many medical conditions and syndromes. Many patients are elderly with ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and renal impairment, which must be assessed before general anaesthesia. Systemic effects of ophthalmic medications, such as hypokalaemia caused by acetazolamide should be considered. A wide range of general anaesthetic techniques are suitable for eye surgery, but certain key points are relevant to speciﬁc operations. These include the oculo-cardiac reﬂex in strabismus and retinal surgery, the use of intraocular gas bubbles in vitreo-retinal operations, controlled hypotension in lacrimal, orbital and other oculoplastic procedures, and the high incidence of nausea after strabismus surgery. Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) fulﬁls many of the requirements for the ideal anaesthetic technique for ophthalmic surgery. Blood pressure, heart rate and intraocular pressure are lowered. It is rapidly titratable and recovery is fast. Postoperative nausea is reduced and TIVA works well in patients with renal and hepatic disease. Remifentanil infusion allows nitrous oxide to be avoided and top-up doses of muscle relaxants to be minimized during ventilation. For most ophthalmic surgery, postoperative pain is mild and non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs work well. Intraoperative sub-Tenon’s local anaesthetic is useful.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Pritchard","given":"Nicholas C.B."}],"citation-key":"Pritchard_Ophthalmicsurgery_2014","container-title":"Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine","container-title-short":"Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.mpaic.2013.11.006","ISSN":"14720299","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1]]},"language":"en","page":"26-29","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ophthalmic surgery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1472029913002944","volume":"15"},

Under usual circumstances, surgery is only conducted during pregnancy when it is absolutely necessary for the wellbeing of the mother, fetus, or both. Even so, the outcome is generally favourable for both the mother and the fetus. All general anaesthetic drugs cross the placenta and there is no optimal general anaesthetic technique. Neither is there convincing evidence that any particular anaesthetic drug is toxic in humans. There is weak evidence that nitrous oxide should be avoided in early pregnancy due to a potential association with pregnancy loss with high exposure. There is evidence in animal models that many general anaesthetic techniques cause inappropriate neuronal apoptosis and behavioural deﬁcits in later life. It is not known whether these considerations affect the human fetus but studies are underway. Given the general considerations of avoiding fetal exposure to unnecessary medication and potential protection of the maternal airway, regional anaesthesia is usually preferred in pregnancy when it is practical for the medical and surgical condition. When surgery is indicated during pregnancy maintenance of maternal oxygenation, perfusion and homeostasis with the least extensive anaesthetic that is practical will assure the best outcome for the fetus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Reitman","given":"E."},{"family":"Flood","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Reitman.Flood_Nonobstetricsurgery_2011","container-title":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","container-title-short":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","DOI":"10.1093/bja/aer343","ISSN":"00070912","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12]]},"language":"en","page":"i72-i78","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Non-obstetric surgery during pregnancy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0007091217325564","volume":"107"},

  {"id":"Rodseth_Researchidea_","abstract":"We present a fifteen-step process to assist in taking an idea to a research publication. This process ensures that evidence-based medicine practice is followed to prevent redundant research questions. The steps are the following: Step 1 – Identify broad research ideas with a potentially‘weak’evidence base, rather than starting with a specific research question. Step 2 – Identify the knowledge gap within the intended field of research by examining the background literature. Step 3 – Focus on the ‘foreground knowledge’ to frame a potential research question. Step 4 – Conduct a comprehensive literature search, to determine whether the question has been asked before, and if so, if the research was robust. Step 5 – Write a study one-page summary which provides a succinct summary of what you intend to do. Step 6 – Learn how to pitch your research idea. Step 7 – Write the protocol. The rigid process of protocol writing will ensure that a number of important practical study issues are dealt with timeously. Step 8 – Discuss the protocol with experts. Their input will make your protocol more robust. Step 9 – Consider the data points, statistical analysis plan and a potential process evaluation. This will ensure no data redundancy which often compromises research projects in resource-limited environments. Step 10 – Make a ‘social contract’ committing oneself publicly to the project. Step 11 – Write a grant application. This allows identification of funding priorities of potential grant funding agencies, thereby allowing the researcher to frame their research in such a manner to hopefully ensure the financial support necessary for the success of the project. Step 12 – Ensure that the research protocol is publicly visible, which increases the integrity of the project. Step 13 – Conduct the research, which requires education, communication and steering committee meetings to ensure early identification of study conduct problems. Step 14 –Analyse the data according to the statistical analysis plan. Step 15 – Write a good manuscript.","author":[{"family":"Rodseth","given":"RN"}],"citation-key":"Rodseth_Researchidea_","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Research: From idea to publication","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"Rosenblatt.etal_PreoperativeEndoscopic_2011","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Development of a perioperative plan for management of patients with airway pathology is a challenge for the anesthesiologist. Lack of comprehensive information regarding the architecture of airway lesions often leads the clinician to consider techniques of awake intubation (AI) to avoid catastrophic outcomes in this population. In one uncontrolled trial, endoscopic visualization of the airway lesion was included in the preoperative anesthetic assessment for planning of airway management. We sought to determine whether visual inspection of airway pathology would change the anesthesiologist’s approach to the management of these patients.\nMETHODS: Patients presenting for elective diagnostic or therapeutic airway procedures were included in the study. After a standard examination of the airway, a management plan was recorded. Before entering the operating room, and after brief preparation of the nares with a vasoconstrictor and local anesthetic, the patients underwent a preoperative endoscopic airway examination (PEAE) and a ﬁnal airway management plan was recorded and implemented. Four or more months after the procedure, video recordings of the PEAE were reviewed without other patient identiﬁers and a remote PEAE plan was recorded, to test for operator bias.\nRESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight patients were studied. Although AI was initially planned in 44 patients, only 16 of these patients underwent preinduction airway control after PEAE (P Ͼ 0.05). Additionally, of the 94 patients for whom the initial plan was airway control after the induction of anesthesia, 8 patients were found to have unexpectedly severe airway pathology on PEAE, and also underwent AI. There was no signiﬁcant difference between the post-PEAE airway management plan and the remote plan recorded 4 or more months later.\nCONCLUSIONS: In 26% of the patients studied, PEAE affected the planned airway management. We believe that PEAE can be an essential component of the preoperative assessment of patients with airway pathology; airway visualization reduces the number of unnecessary AIs while providing superior information about the airway architecture. PEAE could be applied to other populations of patients at risk for airway control failure with the induction of anesthesia.

  {"id":"Saggar.etal_FactorsInfluencing_2008","abstract":"Background: There is a paucity of published data on the incidence of subcutaneous emphysema and the causative factors responsible for its occurrence during laparoscopic procedures. This study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence and factors associated with the occurrence of subcutaneous emphysema in patients undergoing a laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. Materials and Methods: The prospective study included 100 patients who presented with a primary inguinal hernia and underwent an elective laparoscopic TEP hernia repair from November 2003 to May 2005. Various factors, including age, body mass index (BMI), type of hernia (i.e., unilateral or bilateral, indirect or direct), duration of surgery, and end-tidal carbon-dioxide tension (start and peak), were evaluated. A grading system was evolved to document clinically apparent subcutaneous emphysema immediately and at 6 and 24 hours after the surgical procedure.\nResults: A BMI Ͻ25, longer operating time (especially Ͼ1 hour), and higher end-tidal carbondioxide tension (start, peak, and difference) were found to be significantly associated with the development of subcutaneous emphysema. Age and type of hernia—unilateral versus bilateral, direct versus indirect—were not found to be statistically significant factors.\nConclusions: The incidence of subcutaneous emphysema in laparoscopic extraperitoneal hernia repairs is high and largely under-reported. Once it is noted, the progression of the surgical emphysema during this type of surgery can have serious complications (e.g., cardiovascular and hemodynamic disturbances) unless timely, appropriate measures are taken.

Compared with conventional exploratory laparotomy, the benefits of laparoscopic surgery include reduction of surgical wound, decreasing in postoperative pain, shortening hospital stay, rapid recovery, and a better cosmetic result. However, there are still up to 80% of patients after laparoscopic surgery complaining of high levels of pain and needing pain relief. Postlaparoscopic pain can be separated into distinct causes, such as surgical trauma- or incision wound-associated inflammatory change, and pneumoperitoneum (carbon dioxide [CO2])-related morphological and biochemical changes of peritoneum and diaphragm. The latter is secondary to irritation, stretching, and foreign body stimulation, leading to phrenic neuropraxia and subsequent shoulder-tip pain (STP). STP is the most typical unpleasant experience of patients after laparoscopic surgery. There are at least 11 strategies available to attempt to decrease postlaparoscopic STP, including (1) the use of an alternative insufflating gas in place of CO2, (2) the use of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum in place of standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum, (3) the use of warmed or warmed and humidified CO2, (4) gasless laparoscopy, (5) subdiaphragmatic intraperitoneal anesthesia, (6) local intraperitoneal anesthesia, (7) actively expelling out of gas, (8) intraperitoneal drainage, (9) fluid instillation, (10) pulmonary recruitment maneuvers, and (11) others and combination. The present article is limited in discussing postlaparoscopic STP. We extensively review published articles to provide a better strategy to reduce postlaparoscopic STP.","author":[{"family":"Sao","given":"Chih-Hsuan"},{"family":"Chan-Tiopianco","given":"Mareesol"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Kai-Cheng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yi-Jen"},{"family":"Horng","given":"Huann-Cheng"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Wen-Ling"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Peng-Hui"}],"citation-key":"Sao.etal_Painlaparoscopic_2019","container-title":"J Chin Med Assoc","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Pain after laparoscopic surgery: Focus on shoulder-tip pain after gynecological laparoscopic surgery","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Schuster.etal_Associationplasma_2017","abstract":"Recently, calcium was suggested to be the active moiety of acamprosate. We examined plasma calcium concentrations in association with severity of alcohol dependence and its interaction with regulating pathways and alcohol craving in alcohol-dependent patients. 47 inpatient alcohol-dependent patients undergoing detoxiﬁcation treatment underwent laboratory testing, including calcium, sodium, liver enzymes as well as serum concentrations of calcitonin, parathyroid hormone and vitamin D. The psychometric dimension of craving was analyzed with the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS). The severity of withdrawal was measured with the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) and with the Alcohol Dependence Scale for high-risk sample (ADS-HR). The main ﬁndings of our investigation are: a) a negative correlation of plasma calcium concentrations with alcohol craving in different dimensions of the OCDS; b) a negative correlation of plasma calcium concentrations with breath alcohol concentration; c) lowered calcitonin concentration in the high-risk sample of alcoholics; d) lowered plasma vitamin D concentrations in all alcoholic subjects. Our study adds further support for lowered plasma calcium concentrations in patients with high alcohol intake and especially in patients with increased craving as a risk factor for relapse. Lowered calcitonin concentrations in the high-risk sample and lowered vitamin D concentrations may mediate these effects. Calcium supplementation could be a useful intervention for decreasing craving and relapse in alcoholdependent subjects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schuster","given":"Rilana"},{"family":"Koopmann","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Grosshans","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Reinhard","given":"Iris"},{"family":"Spanagel","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Kiefer","given":"Falk"}],"citation-key":"Schuster.etal_Associationplasma_2017","container-title":"European Neuropsychopharmacology","container-title-short":"European Neuropsychopharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.euroneuro.2016.11.007","ISSN":"0924977X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1]]},"language":"en","page":"42-47","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Association of plasma calcium concentrations with alcohol craving: New data on potential pathways","title-short":"Association of plasma calcium concentrations with alcohol craving","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0924977X16319824","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"Schuster.etal_CalciumCarbonate_2021","abstract":"<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Preclinical studies have shown that calcium seems to be the active component of the anti-craving drug acamprosate (Ca<sup>2+</sup> bis-acetyl-homotaurinate). Clinical effects in humans have also indicated an association between increased calcium plasma concentration due to acamprosate treatment and better outcome relating to time to relapse and cumulative abstinence. In contrast, low calcium concentration in alcohol-dependent patients was related with craving for alcohol. The main goal of the trial was to investigate whether an oral calcium administration is able to affect craving, withdrawal, and relapse risk in alcohol-dependent patients. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We conducted a single-blind, randomized, monocentric, controlled clinical two-arm trial in alcohol-dependent patients (Clinical Trials Registration: DRKS00011293). A total of 55 alcohol-dependent subjects received calcium carbonate (800 mg + 5 μg vitamin D) versus sodium bicarbonate (1,000 mg) daily during the 14 days of inpatient alcohol-withdrawal treatment. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Based on an intention-to-treat protocol, withdrawal intensity (assessed with CIWA-Ar) in the calcium carbonate group attenuated faster than in the sodium bicarbonate subgroup. Alcohol craving (assessed with OCDS) in the calcium carbonate subgroup was also significantly reduced versus the sodium bicarbonate subgroup. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Our data support earlier findings and show that treatment with calcium carbonate during alcohol withdrawal reduces symptoms of alcohol withdrawal as well as alcohol craving in a controlled clinical pilot study. Mode of actions will need to be determined to allow the further development of pharmacological interventions beyond Ca<sup>2+</sup> bis-acetyl-homotaurinate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schuster","given":"Rilana"},{"family":"Winkler","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Koopmann","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Bach","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Hoffmann","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Reinhard","given":"Iris"},{"family":"Spanagel","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Bumb","given":"J.

  {"id":"Seymour.etal_GeneralAnesthesia_2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In resource-limited environments, spinal anesthesia (SA) is preferred for cesarean delivery. In women at risk of spinal epidural hematoma, particularly those with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, thrombocytopenia should be excluded before neuraxial blockade. In the context of emergency surgery for fetal distress, this investigation may be hampered by laboratory services being unavailable or off-site.\nMETHODS: The Obstetric Airway Management Registry (ObAMR) is currently active across all anesthesia training institutions affiliated with the University of Cape Town. This multicenter observational study aimed to estimate the proportion of patients receiving general anesthesia (GA) for either confirmed or suspected thrombocytopenia, which was not excluded due to unavailability of laboratory results. To establish the number of GA uses that may have been avoided if platelet counts were available, we retrospectively searched for subsequent platelet counts in patients for whom thrombocytopenia was suspected. An algorithm was proposed, including a simple decision aid for estimating risk versus benefit of SA versus GA, to be followed in the setting of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and thrombocytopenia.\nRESULTS: Thrombocytopenia was the indication for GA in 100 of 591 patients (16.9%) captured in the registry. In total, 48 of 591 (8.1%) had confirmed thrombocytopenia, and 52 of 591 (8.8%) had suspected thrombocytopenia. Of these patients, 91 of 100 had a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. In the confirmed thrombocytopenia group, the indication for GA was a platelet count <75 × 109/L. In the suspected thrombocytopenia group, 46 of 52 (88.5%) platelet counts could be retrospectively traced. The median (interquartile range) platelet count was 178 × 109/L (93 – 233 × 109/L), and platelets exceeded 75 × 109/L in 41 of 46 patients (89.1%). In the 5 of 46 patients with retrospectively confirmed thrombocytopenia, 2 had hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome, 2 had antepartum hemorrhage with preeclampsia, and 1 had isolated thrombocytopenia with preeclampsia.\nCONCLUSIONS: In 17% of patients, the indication for GA was thrombocytopenia. Of these, 52 of 100, or nearly 9% of the total of 591, received GA because a platelet count was unavailable at the time of surgery. The importance of early laboratory assessment, when available, should be emphasized. Overall, 41 of 591 (6.9%) had a platelet count >75 × 109/L and would not have needed GA if their platelet count had been known. After following the constructed algorithm and applying the decision aid to assess risk and benefit, there may be circumstances in which the clinician justifiably opts for SA when a platelet count is indicated but unavailable.  (Anesth Analg 2023;136:992–8)","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Seymour","given":"Lisa M."},{"family":"Fernandes","given":"Nicole L."},{"family":"Dyer","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Smit","given":"Maretha I."},{"family":"Van Dyk","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Hofmeyr","given":"Ross"}],"citation-key":"Seymour.etal_GeneralAnesthesia_2023","container-title":"Anesthesia & Analgesia","DOI":"10.1213/ANE.0000000000006217","ISSN":"0003-2999","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"en","page":"992-998","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"General Anesthesia for Cesarean Delivery for Thrombocytopenia in Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy: Findings From the Obstetric Airway Management Registry","title-short":"General Anesthesia for Cesarean Delivery for Thrombocytopenia in Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/10.1213/ANE.0000000000006217","volume":"136"},

  {"id":"Smit.etal_Implementationinitial_2020","abstract":"Background: In Africa, maternal mortality after caesarean delivery is 50 times greater than in high-income countries. In South Africa, more than 50% of anaesthesia-related maternal mortality is attributed to failure to protect the airway. We implemented an obstetric airway management registry, to facilitate future improvements in management and outcomes.\nMethods: A prospective electronic registry was established at three obstetric sites in Cape Town, recording airway management for all general anaesthetics from 20 weeks gestation to seven days post-partum. Perioperative descriptive data are entered using a web-based smartphone-enabled platform. To quantify the reliability of capture, we compared the first 200 records in the registry to theatre logbooks. We used summary statistics to describe our obstetric anaesthesia population, and details relevant to airway management.\nResults: The first 200 cases were recorded from September 2018 to January 2019. According to theatre logbooks, this represented 80% of cases performed. Major indications for general anaesthesia included severe fetal distress/bradycardia (21%), failed neuraxial technique (19%), coagulopathy (19%), and abnormal placentation (12%). A third of patients had hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and 6% had imminent/confirmed eclampsia. Forty per cent were in active labour. On airway assessment, Mallampati grade was 3 or 4 in 29% of patients, and mouth opening, thyromental distance and mandibular protrusion limited in 10%, 8% and 8% respectively. Cormack-Lehane grade IIb and III views were encountered in 6% and 2% respectively, with no grade IV views. Desaturation below 90% occurred in 12% of patients. There were two cases (1%) of failed intubation with supraglottic airway rescue, and no emergency surgical airways performed.\nConclusion: An obstetric airway management registry was successfully implemented. Clinically significant hypoxaemia occurred commonly during general anaesthesia, with a high incidence of difficult intubation predictors and desaturation. The registry will guide research aimed at improving safety during general anaesthesia in obstetrics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Smit","given":"M.I."},{"family":"Hofmeyr","given":"R."},{"family":"Van Dyk","given":"D."},{"family":"Dyer","given":"R.A."},{"family":"Van Tonder","given":"C."},{"family":"Du Toit","given":"L."}],"citation-key":"Smit.etal_Implementationinitial_2020","container-title":"Southern African Journal of Anaesthesia and Analgesia","container-title-short":"Southern African Journal of Anaesthesia and Analgesia","DOI":"10.36303/SAJAA.2020.26.4.2423","ISSN":"2220-1181, 2220-1173","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,31]]},"language":"en","page":"198-205","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Implementation and initial validation of a multicentre obstetric airway management registry","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.co.za/doi/10.36303/SAJAA.2020.26.4.2423","volume":"26"},

There is a long tradition of applying clinical pathways to the perioperative care of joint arthroplasty patients. Enhanced recovery after surgery represents the next step in the evolution of standardized care. To date, reports of full ERAS pathways for hip or knee arthroplasty are lacking. In this narrative review, we present the evidence base that can be usefully applied to constructing ERAS pathways for hip or knee arthroplasty. The history and rationale for applying ERAS to joint arthroplasty are explained. Evidence demonstrates improved outcomes after joint arthroplasty when a standardized approach to care is implemented. The efﬁcacy of individual ERAS components in hip or knee replacement is considered, including preoperative education, intraoperative anaesthetic techniques, postoperative analgesia, and early mobilization after joint arthroplasty. Interventions lacking high-quality evidence are identiﬁed, together with recommendations for future research. Based on currently available evidence, we present a model ERAS pathway that can be applied to perioperative care of patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Soffin","given":"E.M."},{"family":"YaDeau","given":"J.T."}],"citation-key":"Soffin.YaDeau_ERAS_Joint_2016","container-title":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","container-title-short":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","DOI":"10.1093/bja/aew362","ISSN":"00070912","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"language":"en","page":"iii62-iii72","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"ERAS_Joint","title-short":"Enhanced recovery after surgery for primary hip and knee arthroplasty","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0007091217301381","volume":"117"},

  {"id":"Szabo.etal_ThoracoscopyEvolusion_2022_2022","abstract":"Background and Objective: Thanks to the growing experience with the non-intubated anesthetic and surgical techniques, most pulmonary resections can now be performed by using minimally invasive techniques. The conventional method, i.e., surgery on the intubated, ventilated patient under general anesthesia with one-lung ventilation (OLV) was considered necessary for the major thoracoscopic lung resections for all patients. An adequate analgesic approach (regional or epidural anesthesia) allows videoassisted thoracoscopy (VATS) to be performed in anesthetized patients and thus the potential adverse effects related to general anesthesia and mechanical OLV can be minimized.\nMethods: Multiple medical literature databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus) were searched, using the terms [(non-intubated) OR (nonintubated) OR (tubeless) OR (awake)] AND [(thoracoscopic surgery)] from 2004 to December 2021. Thirty hundred and six scientific papers were collected. The editorials, commentaries, letters, and papers were excluded, that focus on other than the non-intubated (aka awake or tubeless) VATS technique, as well as the full text scientific papers available in languages other than English. Key Content and Findings: After reviewing the literature, we identified “schools” with different techniques but with very similar results. Most of the differences were in the anesthetic technique, oxygenation and analgesia, however, the immunological results, and the qualitative parameters (inpatient hospital care days, complication rate, mortality) of the perioperative period showed great similarity, in addition, all three schools identified the same risk factors (hypoxia, hypercapnia, airway safety). The combination of spontaneous ventilation with double lumen tube intubation, called VATS-spontaneous ventilation with intubation (SVI) method seems to be suitable for reducing these risk factors, which may serve as an alternative for patients not suitable for the non-intubated technique in the near future.\nConclusions: Based on the results, non-intubated thoracic surgery appears to be an increasingly widespread, safe procedure, that will be available to a wider range of patients as experience expands and by the implication of the constantly evolving new processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Szabo","given":"Zsolt"},{"family":"Fabo","given":"Csongor"},{"family":"Oszlanyi","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Hawchar","given":"Fatime"},{"family":"Géczi","given":"Tibor"},{"family":"Lantos","given":"Judit"},{"family":"Furák","given":"Jozsef"}],"citation-key":"Szabo.etal_ThoracoscopyEvolusion_2022_2022","container-title":"Journal of Thoracic Disease","container-title-short":"J Thorac Dis","DOI":"10.21037/jtd-22-80","ISSN":"20721439, 20776624","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"en","page":"3045-3060","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Thoracoscopy Evolusion_2022","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jtd.amegroups.com/article/view/67307/html","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"Tasbihgou.etal_Accidentalawareness_2018","abstract":"Unintended accidental awareness during general anaesthesia represents failure of successful anaesthesia, and so has been the subject of numerous studies during the past decades. As return to consciousness is both difﬁcult to describe and identify, the reported incidence rates vary widely. Similarly, a wide range of techniques have been employed to identify cases of accidental awareness. Studies which have used the isolated forearm technique to identify responsiveness to command during intended anaesthesia have shown remarkably high incidences of awareness. For example, the ConsCIOUS-1 study showed an incidence of responsiveness around the time of laryngoscopy of 1:25. On the other hand, the 5th Royal College of Anaesthetists National Audit Project, which reported the largest ever cohort of patients who had experienced accidental awareness, used a system to identify patients who spontaneously selfreported accidental awareness. In this latter study, the incidence of accidental awareness was 1:19,600. In the recently published SNAP-1 observational study, in which structured postoperative interviews were performed, the incidence was 1:800. In almost all reported cases of intra-operative responsiveness, there was no subsequent explicit recall of intra-operative events. To date, there is no evidence that this occurrence has any psychological consequences. Among patients who experience accidental awareness and can later remember details of their experience, the consequences are better known. In particular, when awareness occurs in a patient who has been given neuromuscular blocking agents, it may result in serious sequelae such as symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and a permanent aversion to surgery and anaesthesia, and is feared by patients and anaesthetists. In this article, the published literature on the incidence, consequences and management of accidental awareness under general anaesthesia with subsequent recall will be reviewed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Tasbihgou","given":"S.

  {"id":"Temesgen.etal_Adultsedation_2021","abstract":"Background: Sedation and analgesia are essential in the intensive care unit in order to promote control of pain, anxiety, prevent loss of materials, accidental extubation and improve the synchrony of patients with ventilator. However, excess of these medications leads to an increased morbidity and mortality, and thus demands protocol.\nMethods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Meta-Analysis Protocol have been used to undertake this review. Pub Med, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar search engines were used to find up-todate evidence that helps to draw recommendations and conclusions.\nResults: In this Guideline and Systematic Review, we have used 16 Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis, 3 Evidence-Based Guidelines and 10 RCT Meta-Analysis, 6 Systemic Reviews of Non-randomized Studies, 8 Ran­ domized Clinical Trials, 11 Cohort Studies, 5 Cross-Sectional Studies and 1 Case Report with their respective study descriptions. Discussion: Analgesia, which as a sedation basement can reduce sedative use, is key aspect of treatment in ICU patients, and we can also conclude that an analgesic sedation regimen can reduce the occurrence of delirium by reducing sedatives. The aim of this guideline and the systematic review is to write up and formulate analgesiabased sedation for limited resource settings.\nConclusions: Analgesia and sedation are effective in critically ill patients; however, too much sedation is asso­ ciated with longer periods of mechanical ventilation and longer duration of ICU stay. Poorly managed ICU pa­ tients have a delirium rate of up to 80%, increased mortality, longer hospital stays, higher hospital costs and bad long-term outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Temesgen","given":"Netsanet"},{"family":"Chekol","given":"Bsazinew"},{"family":"Tamirie","given":"Tadesse"},{"family":"Eshetie","given":"Denberu"},{"family":"Simeneh","given":"Nigussie"},{"family":"Feleke","given":"Abatneh"}],"citation-key":"Temesgen.etal_Adultsedation_2021","container-title":"Annals of Medicine & Surgery","DOI":"10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102356","ISSN":"2049-0801","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Adult sedation and analgesia in a resource limited intensive care unit – A Systematic Review and evidence based guideline","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102356","volume":"66"},

  {"id":"Tsolaki.etal_Dementia_2022","abstract":"Concerns around the impact of anesthesia on cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), have been increasing and recently attracting considerable attention in the research community. One unanswered question is whether anesthesia is a risk factor of dementia, specifically AD type dementia. A large body of evidence, coming from in vivo and in vitro models, suggests that exposure to anesthetic agents may increase the risk of AD through mechanisms of action similar to AD’s neuropathology. In terms of clinical studies, our knowledge of the relationship between anesthesia and dementia is based on limited data, with most studies suggesting that there is no association. The aim of this paper was therefore to outline recent clinical studies exploring this controversial relationship and discuss future directions in terms of study design and potential areas of study. As the aging population and the prevalence of dementia and AD increases, we need a better understanding of anesthesia as a risk factor for neurodegeneration through well-designed studies. Despite the controversy, there seems to be little evidence to support that anesthesia itself or other surgical and patient factors can cause or accelerate AD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Tsolaki","given":"Magda"},{"family":"Sia","given":"Eleni"},{"family":"Giannouli","given":"Vaitsa"}],"citation-key":"Tsolaki.etal_Dementia_2022","container-title":"Applied Neuropsychology: Adult","container-title-short":"Applied Neuropsychology: Adult","DOI":"10.1080/23279095.2022.2110871","ISSN":"2327-9095, 2327-9109","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,18]]},"language":"en","page":"1-10","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dementia","title-short":"Anesthesia and dementia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23279095.2022.2110871"},

  {"id":"Walker_Neonatalpain_2014","abstract":"Effective management of procedural and postoperative pain in neonates is required to minimize acute physiological and behavioral distress and may also improve acute and long-term outcomes. Painful stimuli activate nociceptive pathways, from the periphery to the cortex, in neonates and behavioral responses form the basis for validated pain assessment tools. However, there is an increasing awareness of the need to not only reduce acute behavioral responses to pain in neonates, but also to protect the developing nervous system from persistent sensitization of pain pathways and potential damaging effects of altered neural activity on central nervous system development. Analgesic requirements are inﬂuenced by age-related changes in both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response, and increasing data are available to guide safe and effective dosing with opioids and paracetamol. Regional analgesic techniques provide effective perioperative analgesia, but higher complication rates in neonates emphasize the importance of monitoring and choice of the most appropriate drug and dose. There have been significant improvements in the understanding and management of neonatal pain, but additional research evidence will further reduce the need to extrapolate data from older age groups. Translation into improved clinical care will continue to depend on an integrated approach to implementation that encompasses assessment and titration against individual response, education and training, and audit and feedback.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Suellen M."}],"citation-key":"Walker_Neonatalpain_2014","container-title":"Pediatric Anesthesia","container-title-short":"Pediatric Anesthesia","DOI":"10.1111/pan.12293","editor":[{"family":"Wolf","given":"Andy"}],"ISSN":"1155-5645, 1460-9592","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1]]},"language":"en","page":"39-48","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neonatal pain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pan.12293","volume":"24"},

The crux of sepsis management remains early identiﬁcation and diagnostic testing, early antimicrobial therapy, and early haemodynamic resuscitation.

  {"id":"Wiegele.etal_Caudalepidural_2019","abstract":"Caudal epidural blockade in children is one of the most widely administered techniques of regional anaesthesia. Recent clinical studies have answered major pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic questions, thus providing the scientiﬁc background for safe and effective blocks in daily clinical practice and demonstrating that patient selection can be expanded to range from extreme preterm births up to 50 kg of body weight. This narrative review discusses the main ﬁndings in the current literature with regard to patient selection (sub-umbilical vs mid-abdominal indications, contraindications, low-risk patients with spinal anomalies); anatomical considerations (access problems, age and body positioning, palpation for needle insertion); technical considerations (veriﬁcation of needle position by ultrasound vs landmarks vs ‘whoosh’ or ‘swoosh’ testing); training and equipment requirements (learning curve, needle types, risk of tissue spreading); complications and safety (paediatric regional anaesthesia, caudal blocks); local anaesthetics (bupivacaine vs ropivacaine, risk of toxicity in children, management of toxic events); adjuvant drugs (clonidine, dexmedetomidine, opioids, ketamine); volume dosing (dermatomal reach, cranial rebound); caudally accessed lumbar or thoracic anaesthesia (contamination risk, verifying catheter placement); and postoperative pain. Caudal blocks are an efﬁcient way to offer perioperative analgesia for painful sub-umbilical interventions. Performed on sedated children, they enable not only early ambulation, but also periprocedural haemodynamic stability and spontaneous breathing in patient groups at maximum risk of a difﬁcult airway. These are important advantages over general anaesthesia, notably in preterm babies and in children with cardiopulmonary co-morbidities. Compared with other techniques of regional anaesthesia, a case for caudal blocks can still be made.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wiegele","given":"Marion"},{"family":"Marhofer","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Lönnqvist","given":"Per-Arne"}],"citation-key":"Wiegele.etal_Caudalepidural_2019","container-title":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","container-title-short":"British Journal of Anaesthesia","DOI":"10.1016/j.bja.2018.11.030","ISSN":"00070912","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4]]},"language":"en","page":"509-517","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Caudal epidural blocks in paediatric patients","title-short":"Caudal epidural blocks in paediatric patients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0007091219300066","volume":"122"},

Pre-operative identiﬁcation of high-risk individuals and appropriate peri-operative management can reduce cardiovascular risk. It is important to continue chronic beta-blocker and statin therapy. Statins are relatively safe and peri-operative initiation may be beneﬁcial in high-risk patients and those scheduled for vascular surgery. The preoperative introduction of beta-blockers reduces myocardial injury but increases rates of stroke and mortality, possibly due to hypotension. They should only be considered in high-risk patients and the dose should be titrated to heart rate. Alpha-2 agonists may also contribute to hypotension. Aspirin continuation can increase the risk of major bleeding and offset the beneﬁt of reduced myocardial risk.

These if left untreated can result in severe morbidity and mortality. However vascular surgery, the main deﬁnitive treatment for such conditions, is associated with subsequent injury to vital organs including the kidneys, heart, brain, intestines and lungs, with a consequent increase in both morbidity and mortality. The current thinking is that the underlying mechanism of injury is direct organ ischaemia and ischaemia induced formation of free radicals, cytokine release and mitochondrial failure. Various methods to alleviate such injuries have been investigated including pre- and postconditioning strategies, pharmacological therapies including volatile anaesthetic and alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist drugs and more recently remote conditioning strategies. Although these interventions have demonstrated some reduction in the biomarkers for organ injury, attempts to translate these beneﬁts into clinical practice have not been successful in terms of morbidity, mortality or length of hospital stay.

  {"id":"Zieleskiewicz.etal_BedsidePOCUS_2021","abstract":"Background:  Rapid response teams are intended to improve early diagnosis and intervention in ward patients who develop acute respiratory or circulatory failure. A management protocol including the use of a handheld ultrasound device for immediate point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) examination at the bedside may improve team performance. The main objective of the study was to assess the impact of implementing such a POCUS-guided management on the proportion of adequate immediate diagnoses in two groups. Secondary endpoints included time to treatment and patient outcomes.\nMethods:  A prospective, observational, controlled study was conducted in a single university hospital. Two teams alternated every other day for managing in-hospital ward patients developing acute respiratory and/or circulatory failures. Only one of the team used an ultrasound device (POCUS group).\nResults:  We included 165 patients (POCUS group 83, control group 82). Proportion of adequate immediate diagnoses was 94% in the POCUS group and 80% in the control group (p = 0.009). Time to first treatment/intervention was shorter in the POCUS group (15 [10–25] min vs. 34 [15–40] min, p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality rates were 17% in the POCUS group and 35% in the control group (p = 0.007), but this difference was not confirmed in the propensity score sample (29% vs. 34%, p = 0.53).\nConclusion:  Our study suggests that protocolized use of a handheld POCUS device at the bedside in the ward may improve the proportion of adequate diagnosis, the time to initial treatment and perhaps also survival of ward patients developing acute respiratory or circulatory failure.

  {"id":"Zieleskiewicz.etal_Diagnosticpoint_2018","abstract":"Complications during pregnancy are not frequent, but may occur abruptly. Point-of-care ultrasound is a non-invasive, non-ionising diagnostic tool that is available at the bed-side when complications occur. This review covers the use of ultrasound in various clinical situations. Gastric ultrasound can identify stomach contents that put the woman at risk for pulmonary aspiration. In the future, this tool will probably be used routinely before induction of anaesthesia to determine the presence of stomach contents above a particular risk threshold. Difﬁcult tracheal intubation, and the potential for ‘can’t intubate, can’t oxygenate’, is more frequent in pregnant women. Point-of-care ultrasound of the airway allows accurate identiﬁcation of the cricothyroid membrane, permitting rapid and safer establishment of front-of-neck airway access. Combined cardiac and lung ultrasound can determine the potential risk:beneﬁt of ﬂuid administration in the pregnant patient. Such prediction is of critical importance, given the tendency of pregnant women to develop pulmonary oedema. Combined echocardiography and lung ultrasound can be combined with ultrasound of the leg veins to differentiate between the various causes of acute respiratory failure, and guide treatment in this situation. Finally, as shown in the general population, multi-organ point-of-care ultrasound allows early diagnosis of the main causes of circulatory failure and cardiac arrest at the bed-side. As the importance of point-of-care ultrasound in critical patients is increasingly recognised, it is emerging as an important tool in the therapeutic armoury of obstetric anaesthetists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Zieleskiewicz","given":"L."},{"family":"Bouvet","given":"L."},{"family":"Einav","given":"S."},{"family":"Duclos","given":"G."},{"family":"Leone","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Zieleskiewicz.etal_Diagnosticpoint_2018","container-title":"Anaesthesia","container-title-short":"Anaesthesia","DOI":"10.1111/anae.14354","ISSN":"0003-2409, 1365-2044","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1265-1279","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Diagnostic point‐of‐care ultrasound: applications in obstetric anaesthetic management","title-short":"Diagnostic point‐of‐care ultrasound","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anae.14354","volume":"73"},
  {"id":"Zieleskiewicz.etal_LungUltrasound_","abstract":"Background: The role of lung ultrasound has never been evaluated in parturients with severe preeclampsia. The authors’ first aim was to assess the ability of lung ultrasound to detect pulmonary edema in severe preeclampsia. The second aim was to highlight the relation between B-lines and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressures.\nMethods: This prospective cohort study was conducted in a level-3 maternity during a 12-month period. Twenty parturients with severe preeclampsia were consecutively enrolled. Both lung and cardiac ultrasound examinations were performed before (n = 20) and after delivery (n = 20). Each parturient with severe preeclampsia was compared with a control healthy parturient. Pulmonary edema was determined using two scores: the B-pattern and the Echo Comet Score. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressures were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography.\nResults: Lung ultrasound detected interstitial edema in five parturients (25%) with severe preeclampsia. A B-pattern was associated to increased mitral valve early diastolic peak E (116 vs. 90 cm/s; P = 0.05) and to increased E/E’ ratio (9.9 vs. 6.6; P < 0.001). An Echo Comet Score of greater than 25 predicted an increase in filling pressures (E/E’ ratio >9.5) with a sensitivity and specificity of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.69 to 1.00) and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.92), respectively.\nConclusions: In parturients with severe preeclampsia, lung ultrasound detects both pulmonary edema and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressures. The finding of a B-pattern should restrict the use of fluid. However, these preliminary results are associations from a single sample. They need to be replicated in a larger, definitive study.
